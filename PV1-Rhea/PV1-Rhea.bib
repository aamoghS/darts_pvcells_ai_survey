	abstract = {Passivating contacts, like {TOPCon} or poly-Si/{SiOx}, have pushed the efficiency of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells notably. Currently, the world-record efficiency of 25.7\% for a both-sided contact solar cell has been achieved by an n-type solar cell featuring a selective boron front emitter and a passivating rear contact ({TOPCon}). Like the 25\%-efficient {PERL} cell, this record cell was realized on a small area of 2x2 cm² using lab processes, like photolithography and evaporation of metal contacts. This paper addresses the first steps towards the realization of a large area {TOPCon} cell by industry-relevant fabrication steps. The scope of this paper lies on the application of laser ablation and {NiCu} plating to a 1.5µm deep, 140 Ω/sq boron-diffused emitter. The 10x10 cm² cell yielded an efficiency of 22.9\%.},

	abstract = {In this work, the efficiency of n-type silicon solar cells with a front side boron-doped emitter and a full-area tunnel oxide passivating electron contact was studied experimentally as a function of wafer thickness W and resistivity ρb. Conversion efficiencies in the range of 25.0\% have been obtained for all variations studied in this work, which cover 150µm to 400µm thick wafers and resistivities from 1Ωcm to 10Ωcm. We present a detailed cell analysis based on three-dimensional full-area device simulations using the solar cell simulation tool Quokka. We show that the experimental variation of the wafer thickness and resistivity at device level in combination with a detailed simulation study allows the identification of recombination induced loss mechanisms. This is possible because different recombination mechanisms can have a very specific influence on the I-V parameters as a function of W and ρb. In fact, we identified Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in the c-Si bulk as the source of a significant {FF} reduction in case of high resistivity Si. This shows that cells made of high resistivity Si are very sensitive to even a weak lifetime limitation in the c-Si bulk. Applying low resistivity 1Ωcm n-type Si in combination with optimized fabrication processes, we achieved confirmed efficiency values of 25.7\%, with a {VOC} of 725mV, a {FF} of 83.3\% and a {JSC} of 42.5mA/cm2. This represents the highest efficiency reported for both-sides contacted c-Si solar cells. Thus, the results presented in this work demonstrate not only the potential of the cell structure, but also that a variation of the wafer thickness and resistivity at device level can provide deep insights into the cell performance.},

In this paper, we devise cost-driven strategies towards industrial manufacturing of {TOPCon}-based solar cells after assessing various process routes based on currently production-ready and upcoming future alternative process technologies. Our techno-economic assessment suggests that higher capital and operational costs required for {TOPCon} concept is distributed unevenly in the process value chain, with a significant fraction in diffusion/annealing and metallization steps. Nevertheless, under given assumptions, {TOPCon}-concepts are found to remain economically competitive against bifacial {PERC} in terms of levelized cost of electricity ({LCOE}), if a minimum absolute gain in cell efficiency Δη {\textgreater} 0.55\% for most-conservative and Δη {\textgreater} 0.40\% for most-progressive scenarios respectively can be maintained.},

	abstract = {In advancing photovoltaic technology, optimizing the metallization process is crucial for balancing electrical conductivity and optical performance in solar cell fabrication. This process directly impacts the efficiency and quality of solar cells, traditionally measured by the fill factor ({FF}). Historically, efforts have focused on evolving metal contacts to reduce optical shading and series resistance, which degrade solar cell efficiency. Our study enhances n-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (n-{TOPCon}) solar cells by optimizing screen-printing metallization, particularly by examining the effects of squeegee speeds. Employing a mix of experimental and analytical methodologies, we aimed to identify optimal conditions that improve electrical and optical performance, thereby elevating cell efficiency. Our findings indicate that a squeegee speed of 170 mm/s substantially boosts solar cell performance, evidenced by a current density (Jsc) of 38.96 {mA}/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 684.29 {mV}, fill factor ({FF}) of 78.77 \%, and a power conversion efficiency ({PCE}) of 21.00 \%. Further, dark I–V measurements confirmed a shunt resistance (Rsh) of 6.25 × 106 Ω and a reduced series resistance (Rs) of 6.48 Ω, underscoring the significance of precise metallization in reducing resistive losses and enhancing efficiency. Future research will explore innovative materials and cutting-edge printing techniques beyond squeegee speed adjustments. The potential incorporation of nanomaterials and conducting polymers aims to refine the metallization process further, promising to push the boundaries of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This progression is essential for advancing n-{TOPCon} solar cell development, setting new industry standards, and propelling the sustainable energy movement.},

	abstract = {Carrier-selective crystalline silicon heterojunction ({SHJ}) solar cells have already reached superior lab-scale efficiencies. Besides judicious wafer thickness design, the optimal choice of passivation schemes and carrier-selective materials is essential for industry adoption. Appropriate reduction of process complexity and performance benefits through minimal recombination losses are key. Thus, along with well-designed back contacts, the development of low-temperature processable transparent passivating stacks that act as carrier-selective contacts ({CSCs}) is highlighted for their potential in circumventing the limited open-circuit photovoltage and contact-related losses in mainstream solar cells. In this review, effective passivation schemes deploying materials ranging from undoped metal oxides ({MOs}) to doped silicon are evaluated, with a focus on their significance for industrially viable passivating contact development. Passivation stack architectures with {SiOx}/heavily doped polycrystalline silicon (n+-/p+-poly-Si) realize the most attractive polysilicon-on-oxide ({POLO}) junctions and related schemes, e.g., combined with tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) and interdigitated back contact ({IBC}) solar cells. It is envisioned that the industrial trend is to eventually shift from the p-Si passivating emitter rear contact ({PERC}) and passivated emitter and rear polysilicon ({PERPoly}), towards {TOPCon} architectures, due to high manufacturing yields and compatibility with large-area metal screen printing and alternative bifacial designs.},

Carrier selective contacts ({CSC}) are the key technology which has the potential to achieve a higher {PCE} for c-Si-based solar cells closer to their theoretical efficiency limit. A recent and state-of-the-art approach in this domain is the tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) approach, which is completely different from the existing classical heterojunction solar cells. The main and core element of this contact is the tunnel oxide, and its main role is to cut back the minority carrier recombination at the interface. A state-of-the-art n-type c-Si-based {TOPCon} solar cell featuring a passivated rear contact was experimentally analyzed, and the highest {PCE} record of {\textasciitilde}25.7\% was achieved. It has a high fill factor ({FF}) of {\textasciitilde}83.3\%. These reported results prove that the highest efficiency potential is that of the passivated full area rear contact structures and it is more efficient than that of the partial rear contact ({PRC}) structures. In this paper, a review is presented which considers the key characteristics of {TOPCon} solar cells, i.e., minority carrier recombination, contact resistance, and surface passivation. Additionally, practical challenges and key issues related to {TOPCon} solar cells are also highlighted. Finally, the focus turns to the characteristics of {TOPCon} solar cells, which offer an improved and better understanding of doping layers and tunnel oxide along with their mutual and combined effect on the overall performance of {TOPCon} solar cells.},

The high conversion efficiency of 24.4\% and very high {FF}{\textgreater}82\% demonstrates that the efficiency potential of this full-area passivated rear contact is as good as or even better than that of partial rear contact ({PRC}) schemes like {PERL} (passivated emitter and rear locally diffused) and in addition avoids complex structuring steps and features a 1D carrier transport. Likewise, a boron-doped passivated rear contact for p-type solar cells (p-{TOPCon}) is proposed as an alternative to p-{PRC} cells. The optimum device design of {PRC} cells has to account for two opposing effects: a low-loss 3D carrier transport requires a high base doping but Shockley–Read–Hall ({SRH}) recombination within the base due to the formation of boron–oxygen complexes in standard Cz silicon calls for a low base doping level. This conflict might be overcome by p-{TOPCon} because its performance is less sensitive to base doping. This will be discussed on the base of experimental results. It is shown that its high implied fill factor ({iFF}) of 84\% combined with the 1D carrier transport in the base translates into a higher {FF} potential. First investigations on planar solar cells prove the good performance of the p-{TOPCon} with respect to passivation and carrier transport.

However, the poor wettability of the polysilicon film limits the application of the electroplating technology on tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells ({SCs}). In this work, we propose a carbon (C)-doped polysilicon with highly polar C–Si bonds to improve the surface wettability of polysilicon film. By reducing the hydrogen bubble retention during plating, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer can be obtained. To maintain the good conductivity of polysilicon, a double-layer polysilicon structure consisting of a C-doped and a C-free polysilicon films was constructed for {TOPCon} device fabrication. The new design shows an excellent passivation quality with an implied open-circuit voltage ({iVoc}) of 745 {mV} for the lifetime sample and a good contact performance with a low contact resistivity (ρc) of 2–3 {mΩ} cm2 between plated grids and polysilicon films. Finally, the proof-of-concept {TOPCon} devices with the double-layer polysilicon structure and plated metal electrodes deliver a remarkable power conversion efficiency ({PCE}) of 24.18\%.

	abstract = {This work presents a comprehensive numerical evaluation of {PERC} and {TOPCon} technologies, focusing on the impact of radiation-induced defects. This assessment is conducted for p-type silicon solar cells as they are intrinsically more resistant to radiation defects. By rigorously calibrating recombination parameters, radiation-induced defect profiles, and other pertinent details, a robust basis is established for an in-depth comparison of the performance characteristics displayed by both architectures under space conditions. The investigation reveals that when utilizing substrates with high doping levels, both {PERC} and {TOPCon} cells exhibit nearly identical beginning-of-life ({BOL}) and end-of-life ({EOL}) performance. However, with lower substrate doping concentrations, both technologies show improved {BOL} efficiency. Notably, this enhanced {BOL} efficiency does not translate into superior {EOL} efficiency. This distinction in {EOL} efficiency can be attributed to two primary factors triggered by radiation exposure. Firstly, the emergence of defects leads to a reduction in open-circuit voltage. Secondly, dopant compensation contributes to an increase in series resistance. Specifically, for {PERC} cells, the challenge of elevated series resistance is further exacerbated by the requirement for majority carriers to traverse both vertically and laterally to reach the rear metal contact. When a robust defect recovery mechanism or resilient cover glass is absent, substrates characterized by lower doping levels display increased susceptibility to the adverse effects of radiation-induced defects and the subsequent dopant compensation. Under these circumstances, the {TOPCon} technology demonstrates a significant advantage over {PERC}, particularly for high electron fluence due to its full area contacts for both minority and majority charge carriers.},

	abstract = {The tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) structure got more consideration for development of high performance solar cells by the introduction of a tunnel oxide layer between the substrate and poly-Si is best for attaining interface passivation. The quality of passivation of the tunnel oxide layer clearly depends on the bond of {SiO} in the tunnel oxide layer, which is affected by the subsequent annealing and the tunnel oxide layer was formed in the suboxide region ({SiO}, Si$_{\textrm{2}}$O, Si$_{\textrm{2}}$O$_{\textrm{3}}$) at the interface with the substrate. In the suboxide region, an oxygen-rich bond is formed as a result of subsequent annealing that also improves the quality of passivation. To control the surface morphology, annealing profile, and acceleration rate, an oxide tunnel junction structure with a passivation characteristic of 700 {mV} or more (V$_{\textrm{oc}}$) on a p-type wafer could achieved. The quality of passivation of samples subjected to {RTP} annealing at temperatures above 900\&\#x2103; declined rapidly. To improve the quality of passivation of the tunnel oxide layer, the physical properties and thermal stability of the thin layer must be considered. {TOPCon} silicon solar cell has a boron diffused front emitter, a tunnel-{SiO}$_{\textrm{x}}$/n$^{\textrm{+}}$-poly-Si/{SiN}$_{\textrm{x}}$:H structure at the rear side, and screen-printed electrodes on both sides. The saturation currents J$_{\textrm{o}}$ of this structure on polished surface is 1.3 {fA}/cm$^{\textrm{2}}$ and for textured silicon surfaces is 3.7 {fA}/cm$^{\textrm{2}}$ before printing the silver contacts. After printing the Ag contacts, the J$_{\textrm{o}}$ of this structure increases to 50.7 {fA}/cm$^{\textrm{2}}$ on textured silicon surfaces, which is still manageably less for metal contacts. This structure was applied to {TOPCon} solar cells, resulting in a median efficiency of 23.91\%, and a highest efficiency of 24.58\%, independently. The conversion efficiency of interdigitated back-contact solar cells has reached up to 26\% by enhancing the optoelectrical properties for both-sides-contacted of the cells.},

By analyzing {ITRPV} reports from 2012 to 2023, we highlight some key discrepancies between projected industry trends and estimated actual market share. Some technologies have vastly exceeded the expected trends, e.g., the passivated emitter and rear cell and the use of gallium as the dominant p-type dopant. However, other projections have not occurred as quickly as expected, e.g., adopting silicon heterojunction cells and shifting to n-type wafers. In this work, we provide insights into the fidelity of projected trends by discussing some of the factors causing such rapid technological changes. By reflecting on 10 years of roadmap data, we highlight the fast-moving nature of the {PV} industry, meaning that business-as-usual projections must be assessed with caution.},

	abstract = {Tunneling oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells have made a considerable impact on the global photovoltaic ({PV}) market. Yet, its relatively poorer reliability compared to Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact ({PERC}) solar cells puts costly limitations on the module bill of materials that can be used. The use of silver/aluminum (Ag/Al) paste for front-side metallization is identified as a key factor contributing to the relatively poor reliability of {TOPCon} modules, particularly at high temperatures and humidity. However, very recently, laser-assisted firing techniques such as laser-enhanced contact optimization ({LECO}) that combine conventional co-firing at relatively low temperatures with a subsequent laser treatment have emerged as an appealing alternative to standard one-step cofiring. The main driver for laser-assisted firing is enabling higher power conversion efficiencies ({PCE}). This technique permits the application of screen printing pastes with considerably reduced levels of aluminum (Al), or even the complete exclusion of Al. Consequently, the enhancement in {PCE} values may not only boost {PCE}, but may also offer benefits in terms of reliability. This study investigates the impact of Jolywood Special Injected Metallization ({JSIM}) method on the reliability of {TOPCon} solar cells. Cell level damp heat testing at 85 °C and 85\% relative humidity ({DH}85) with selected impurities reveals a significant improvement for the {JSIM} solar cells versus the standard baseline {TOPCon} cells. Baseline cells experienced rapid degradation, with a substantial (∼92\%rel) loss in {PCE} attributed to a significant (∼13,000\%rel) increase in series resistance (Rs) when exposed to sodium chloride ({NaCl}). Conversely, {JSIM} cells showcased remarkable resilience, displaying only a modest drop in {PCE} (∼3.6\%rel) under similar conditions. This work clearly shows that laser-assisted firing processes such as {JSIM} also significantly improve the reliability of {TOPCon} solar cells. This improvement is due to the compatibility of these processes with screen printing pastes that have low or zero Al concentration for the {TOPCon} front. Consequently, this approach enables using more cost-effective materials for {TOPCon} modules, thereby reducing the overall cost of solar electricity.},

In situ doped poly-Si films are studied as their use could simplify the production of industrial n-{TOPCon} solar cells compared to the common approach relying on ex situ doping of intrinsic {LPCVD} poly-Si films. The developed poly-Si passivating contacts exhibited excellent characteristics with low recombination current densities in passivated and screen-printing metallized regions down to 2.3 {fA}/cm2 and 65.8 {fA}/cm2, respectively, and a low contact resistivity of 2.0 {mΩ}⋅cm2. For reaching the best passivating contact characteristics and high solar cell efficiencies, a poly-Si film thickness of 150–200 nm was found to be optimal while a polished rear surface morphology was found to be beneficial. The best solar cell reached a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.01\% along with a high open circuit voltage of 691.7 {mV}, enabled by the passivating contacts with the in situ doped poly-Si films. 1-cell glass-glass laminates were also fabricated with the developed solar cells, which showed no loss in their power output both upon 400 thermal cycles and after 1000 h of damp heat testing. Lastly, a roadmap is presented, indicating strategies to achieve efficiencies up to 25.5\% with n-{TOPCon} solar cells incorporating the in situ P-doped {LPCVD} poly-Si films.},

	abstract = {Recently, the demand for {PV} technology by various sectors, including the public domain, industry, and space technology, has significantly increased. The feasibilities of existing {PV} technologies largely depend on building materials, efficiency, stability, cost, and performance. However, very nominal studies are dedicated to exploring current {PV} technologies’ feasibility. Therefore, the progress of various {PV} technology should be reviewed systemically, specially to promote their practical applications. The present work attempts to sort out the current achievements, summarize the limitations, and point out the necessary research directions for future applications. It reveals that utilization of some {PV} technologies is technically feasible but economically it still seems unfeasible. Si-based {PV} is the most dominant technology with substantial advantages and is expected to maintain the best price competitiveness among all other potential {PV} technologies for the next decades. The traditional Al-{BSF} is gradually replaced by {PERC} and going to be outdated by 2026. The other c-Si based {PV} technologies including {SHJ}, {TOPCon} and {IBC} are expected to be mainstream in the latest 2/3 years due to their improved efficiency and reduced cost. However, the maximum c-Si based {PV} efficiency (26.1\%) is approaching its theoretical Auger efficiency limit of 29.43\% and therefore, some innovative strategies like tandem solar cells receive greater acceptances. Laboratory tests and data from actual services have suggested that {III}–V/Si and {PVK}/Si tandem cells are the most promising candidates to compete with c-Si-based technology in near future due to their specific properties. However, their practical uses are limited owing to some challenges. Similarly, mainstream thin film technologies including {CdTe}, {CIGS}, and {GaAs} play a crucial role in the {PV} market. This comprehensive review presents the significant shortcomings of each {PV}-technology and the possible solutions if any.},
