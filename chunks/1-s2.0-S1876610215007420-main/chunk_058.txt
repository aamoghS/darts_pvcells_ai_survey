 Fig.7 variation of wind velocity, solar radiation, heat gained by water and collector efficiency  6. Conclusions: �x From hotter climatic conditions, proposed system can be proven a one of the efficient source of industrial heating applications.  �x Top covered CPC systems may increase the life of reflecting surfaces & receiver coatings with reduction of heat losses from
