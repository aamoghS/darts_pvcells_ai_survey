y has negative effect on collector efficiency. Eq.B interprets the positive effect of wind velocity on overall heat loss coefficient and heat loss. But the highly positive relationship between overall heat loss coefficient and heat loss indicates that, wind velocity is major adverse factor, affecting the efficiency as compared to other factors such as solar radiation and heat gain.  Ql  = 0.474 +4.185 (V) + 33.20 (Ul) ---------------------------------------- (B) Equation B indicates that when wi
