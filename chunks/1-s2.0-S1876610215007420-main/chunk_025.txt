he work performance and environment of high-temperature solar absorber and enhancing the 
configuration intensity of the reflection surface.[8] Atul Sagade et al. experimented on low cost FRP 
parabolic trough with aluminium receivers which are coated with black epoxy. Authors found that, the 
systems yields 52% and 38 % has been achieved with glass covered receiver and without glass covered 
aluminium receiver respectively.[9] Atul Sagade and N.N shinde worked out thermal performance of 
parabo
