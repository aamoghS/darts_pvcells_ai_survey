unities to cause energy savings and identified about six major areas through which energy conservation measures can effectively cause some savings in energy and allow for its 
stability. [2] Guangjie Gong et.al explains that, the vacuum solar receiver is the key component of a 
parabolic trough solar plant, which plays a prominent role in the gross system efficiency. This paper first 
establishes and optimizes a 1-D theoretical model at Mat lab program to compute the receiverâ€™s major
