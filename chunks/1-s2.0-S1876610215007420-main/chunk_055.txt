rature, outlet water temperature, total heat loss and collector efficiency  5.4 Relation between wind velocity, solar radiation, heat gained by water and collector efficiency  Fig.7 shows the variation of wind velocity, solar radiation, heat gained by water and collector efficiency and eq.D interprets the relation between these parameters. It has been observed that, in case of designed CPC, solar radiation has negative relation with collector efficiency. It is due to the fact that, as radiation
