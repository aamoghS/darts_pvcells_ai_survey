 a regression analysis, has been carried out with different design parameters such as wind velocity, solar radiation on collector, heat loss coefficient, total heat loss from the receiver, heat gained by water flowing through the receiver, collector efficiency. A simple relationship between parameters has been worked out using regression analysis.   5.1 Relation between overall heat loss coefficient with heat loss, heat gain and collector efficiency  Fig.4 shows the variation of heat loss, heat
