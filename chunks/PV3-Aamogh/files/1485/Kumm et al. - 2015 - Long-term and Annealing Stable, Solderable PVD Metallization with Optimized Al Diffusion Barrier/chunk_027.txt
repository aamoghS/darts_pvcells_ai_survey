esents the global maximum within the process parameters of the machine. This TiN layer has a densified, columnar microstructure. In spite of the TiN process optimization, the vertical grain boundaries in the TiN layer offer relatively fast diffusion paths for vertical diffusion processes. This can be prevented by “stuffing” the grain boundaries. When oxygen is brought into the grain boundaries of the TiN layer, it forms Al

 with up-diffusing Al. As Al
