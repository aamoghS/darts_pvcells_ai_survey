go different annealing steps in forming gas (FGA). If subsequently a soldered cell-interconnector proves sufficient adherence of >1 N/mm in a 90°-peel-test, as required by standard DIN EN 50461, we conclude that Al could not overcome the TiN barrier despite the elevated 
temperature during the previous annealing step. If the solder attempt on the metallization fails due to weak wetting
