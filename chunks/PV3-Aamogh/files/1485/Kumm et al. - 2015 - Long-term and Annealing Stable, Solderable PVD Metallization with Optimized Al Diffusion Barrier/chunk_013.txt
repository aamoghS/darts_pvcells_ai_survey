 gas flows can be varied and we can therefore influence the composition of the sputtered TiN layer at a given cathode power by varying the N

-to-Ar gas flow ratio. Additionally, ambient air can be let into the sputter chamber through a valve. Infrared (IR) heaters are installed close to the sputter chamber to allow preheating of the samples. The deposition temperature is measured with a Datapaq logger and thermocouples whi
