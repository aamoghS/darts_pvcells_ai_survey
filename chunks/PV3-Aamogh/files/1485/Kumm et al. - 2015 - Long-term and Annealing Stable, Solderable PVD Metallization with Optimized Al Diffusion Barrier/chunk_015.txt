ared step. By measuring the mass of wafers before and after TiN deposition the density is determined. SEM images are taken to gain insight into the microstructure of the TiN layers.  To investigate the barrier quality of the TiN layer we proceed as described in Ref. [5]. We deposit the PVD metallization scheme with evaporated Al and the sputtered solder stack of 100 nm TiN, 20 nm Ti and 150 nm Ag on saw-damage etched Cz Si wafers which then undergo different annealing steps in forming gas (FGA).
