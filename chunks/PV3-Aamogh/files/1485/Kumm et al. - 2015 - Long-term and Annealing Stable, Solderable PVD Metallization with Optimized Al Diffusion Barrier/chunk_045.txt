ed by an added solder stack. Fig. 3 shows that there is no significant difference in efficiency between the groups. Therefore, we conclude that an application of the solder stack to cells does not influence cell efficiency.  Additionally, demo modules with each 4 PERC cells with solderable PVD metallization and with screen-printed reference cells (see Table 2) are fabricated. One demo module is exemplarily shown in Fig. 4. Long-term stability of solder-joints on cells with the presented PVD meta
