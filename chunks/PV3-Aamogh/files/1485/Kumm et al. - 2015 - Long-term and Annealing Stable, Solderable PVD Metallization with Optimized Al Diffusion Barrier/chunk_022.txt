Furthermore, to investigate long-term stability of the metallization and interconnection on cell and module level, 5 demo modules with 4 PERC cells each are fabricated. The front side metallization is conventionally screen-printed, whereas the cells’ rear sides are metallized with three different metallization schemes as listed in Table 2.
