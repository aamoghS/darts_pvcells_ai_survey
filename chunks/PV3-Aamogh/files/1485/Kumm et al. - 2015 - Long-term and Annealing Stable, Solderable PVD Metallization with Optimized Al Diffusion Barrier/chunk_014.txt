asured with a Datapaq logger and thermocouples which are conductively glued to the wafers.  To characterize the sputtered TiN layers, we determine their specific electrical resistivity and density. TiN layers are deposited on polished and saw damage-etched Cz Si wafers and the specific resistivity of these TiN layers is measured by sheet resistance measurements with a 4-point-probe. The layer thickness is determined by AFM measurement over a prepared step. By measuring the mass of wafers before
