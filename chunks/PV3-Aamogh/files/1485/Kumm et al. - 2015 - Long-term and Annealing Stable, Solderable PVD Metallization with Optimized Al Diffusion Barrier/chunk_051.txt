errupting the high vacuum process sequence, if the stuffing process is enhanced by IR heating. Thus, on the optimized stack a cell-interconnector can be conventionally soldered even after a strong annealing step of 15 min at 425Â°C, which sets this concept apart from other PVD metallization approaches. We show on n-type PERT cells that the cell efficiency is not influenced by the solder stack compared to a reference rear metallization by plain evaporated Al. Additionally, a thermal aging investi
