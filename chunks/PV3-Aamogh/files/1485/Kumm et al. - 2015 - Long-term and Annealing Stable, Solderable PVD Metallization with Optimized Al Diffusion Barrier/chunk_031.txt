400°C (denoted ‘fail’ in Table 3). In contrast, the stuffed barrier is stable even after annealing for 15 min at 425°C, which confirms a highly improved barrier quality of the stuffed TiN.  Additionally, as annealing conditions of 15 min at 425°C are hardly ever exceeded in a final FGA of cell processing, the barrier quality of the stuffed TiN is considered sufficient for all common cell structures. However, the presented stuffing procedure requires an interruption of the deposition proce
