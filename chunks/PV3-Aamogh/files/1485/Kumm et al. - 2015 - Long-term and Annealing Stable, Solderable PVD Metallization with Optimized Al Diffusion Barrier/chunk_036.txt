aling step for 15 min at 425Â°C, see Table 4. In-situ stuffing 
with heating can therefore replace atmospheric stuffing and enables a similarly stable barrier quality that is sufficient 
for all common cell structures. Additionally, it is an industrially applicable process. 5.
 
Long-term stability of solder joints  Long-term stability of solder joints is an important issue regarding industrial application, therefore common cell interconnectors are soldered on the presented atmospherically stuff
