these cell concepts benefit most from annealing steps between 2 min at 300°C and 15 min at 425°C. Since Al diffusion is identified as the crucial process that prevents solderability, it has to be suppressed by an additional Al diffusion barrier. Therefore we introduce a sputtered TiN layer as an Al diffusion barrier, and a thin sputtered Ti layer is added to achieve a sufficient adhesion between Ag and TiN layers [5]. Alternatively, the TiN barrier layer is combined with a solderable NiV/Ag ca
