paste spin coating can be combined with POCl3 diffusion, industrial screen printing was applied as the metallization method. 2. Experiments The n-type PERT solar cells were fabricated on 6 inch CZ phosphorous-doped silicon wafers with resistivity of 0.8–4 ��·cm and thickness of 180 �˛m. The PERT solar cells were fabricated in industrial scale tools. The main process flow is shown in Fig.1.
