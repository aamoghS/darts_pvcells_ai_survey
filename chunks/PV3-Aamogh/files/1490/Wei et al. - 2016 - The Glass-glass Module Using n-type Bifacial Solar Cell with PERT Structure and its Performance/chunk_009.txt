boron paste and baking, boron diffusion in a quartz furnace formed homogeneous junction. Besides, the BSF was fabricated in the industrial POCl3 diffusion system. Thermal Oxide silicon and direct PECVD silicon nitride were deposited on both sides as stack passivation layers, both sides metallization is H-pattern fingers by screen printing.    Fig.1. Solar cell structure (L) and Process flow (R) The modules were encapsulated by EVA with the nPERT solar cells mentioned above. In the process, three
