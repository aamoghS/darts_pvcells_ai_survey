ceiver coatings with reduction of heat losses from the receivers.  �x Theoretical regression modeling equations are satisfied by the actual experimental results; hence can be considered for design purpose & evaluation of thermal performance of the similar systems.  
�x The experimental results are presented and the validity of the model is examined by comparison of 
the theoretical results with experiments which demonstrates a good agreement. �x The proposed system yield a average temperat
