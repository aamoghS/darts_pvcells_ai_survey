ncy  Fig.4 shows the variation of heat loss, heat gain and collector efficieny as compared to overall heat loss coefficient. The regression equations indicates the trend of variation of the parameters. Î·i = 62.78 - 0.529(Ul) - 0.014(Ql) + 0.00256(Qu) ----------------------------------- (A) From eq.A it is clear that as the efficiency of the collector decreases by 1% with increase of overall heat loss coefficient by 0.53 W/(m2 0C) and heat loss and increases as the heat gained by water increases
