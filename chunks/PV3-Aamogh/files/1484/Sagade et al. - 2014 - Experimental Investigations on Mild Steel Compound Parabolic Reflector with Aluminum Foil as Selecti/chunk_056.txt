iciency. It is due to the fact that, as radiation on collector increases, concentration at receiver increases and thus heat losses from receiver increases. As said earlier, wind velocity is major adverse factor, affecting the efficiency and has negative relation with efficiency. The model equation D predicts that collector efficiency will be decrease by 1%, when wind velocity increase by 0.25 m/s , solar radiation increase by 0.255W/m2 . Equation D also interprets that when heat gained by water
