 efficiency. Regression eq.(C) explore the relation between collector efficiency, receiver temperature, outlet water temperature and heat loss. Î·i = 58.50-0.225(Tr) + 0.255(Tout) - 0.00771(Ql) ------------------------------------- (C) Eq.C interprets that, collector efficiency has negative relation with the receiver temperature, because of the fact that, higher the receiver temperature, higher will be the heat losses through the receivers. From equation C it has been clear that, if receiver tem
