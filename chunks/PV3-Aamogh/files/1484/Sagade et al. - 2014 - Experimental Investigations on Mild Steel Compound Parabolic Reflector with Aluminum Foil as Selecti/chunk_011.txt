Kamal Skeiker explains about the important parameter that affect the performance of a solar collector is 
its tilt angle with the horizon. This is because of the variation of tilt angle changes the amount of solar 
radiation reaching the collector surface. Kamal Skeiker has developed a mathematical model for 
estimating the solar radiation on a tilted surface, and to determine the optimum tilt angle and orientation 
(surface azimuth angle) for the s
