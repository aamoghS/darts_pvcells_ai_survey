 Fig. 4 variation of overall heat loss coefficient, heat loss, heat gain and collector efficiency  5.2 Relation between Wind velocity, overall heat loss coefficient on heat loss, total heat loss and collector efficiency Fig.5 explores the effect of wind velocity on heat loss, overall heat loss coefficient and collector efficiency.  From fig.5, it is clear that, the wind velocity has negative effect on collector efficiency. Eq.
