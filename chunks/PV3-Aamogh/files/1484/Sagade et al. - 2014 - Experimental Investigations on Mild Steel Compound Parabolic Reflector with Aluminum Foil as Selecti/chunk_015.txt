rogram to compute the receiver’s major 
heat loss through glass envelope, and then systematically analyzes the major influence factors of heat 
loss. With the laboratorial steady state test stand, the heat losses of both good vacuum and non-vacuum 
Sanle-3 receivers were surveyed by the authors. Authors comparison shows that the original 1-D model 
agrees with the ends covered test while remarkably deviating from end exposed test. Author’s also 
developed a 3-D model by CFD software to furth
