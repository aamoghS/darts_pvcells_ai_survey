r sealing can be obtained with a Kovar oxidation weight gain of 
about 0.3â€“0.8 mg/cm2. A new solar receiver was developed by the new sealing method by the authors [7]. 
The operation principle and design method of a new trough solar concentrator is presented by Tao Tao 
et.al  in this paper. Some important design parameters about the concentrator are analyzed and optimized 
by the authors and their magnitude ranges are given. Some characteristic parameters about the 
concentrator are compared
