sses on performance of prototype parabolic dish water heater with coated and 
non coated receivers. Authors explained that instantaneous efficiency of 63% and 48 % has been achieved 
with coated and non coated receivers [6]. The breakage of the glass to metal sealing is the primary 
ongoing issue for the solar receiver tubes in parabolic trough solar power systems. Sealing failure leads to 
loss of the vacuum inside the tube which substantially reduces the collector efficiency. It is a technical
