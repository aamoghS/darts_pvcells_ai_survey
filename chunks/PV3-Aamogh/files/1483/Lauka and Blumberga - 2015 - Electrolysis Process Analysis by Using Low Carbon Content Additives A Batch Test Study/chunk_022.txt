made in the shape of a sphere, because it provides a 
larger surface area and less chance of the sample sticking on the laboratory equipment. Samples were heated to 900 Â°C temperature for 2 hours. Samples were then cooled and placed in hermetically sealed bags again until later use in 
electrolysis batch tests. 2.3.Experimental equipment Based on alkaline water electrolysis, a principle electrolysis apparatus was built for the experiment. The principal scheme of electrolysis is seen in Fig. 2
