 of analyzing samples. The results were validated using the effects of variables, the half-normal probability plot, Standardized Pareto chart, main effects plot for pH and estimated response surface for variables. The used validation methods show that there is strong correlation between pH value and used sample mixture in the experiment. Further research needed to prove the theory about possibilities of ash use as an electrolyte component. Â© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Peer-rev
