where for the all samples they are equal).  The experiment was conducted with the aim to produce hydrogen without chemical catalyst use in the electrolysis process. Three hydrogen measurements were taken with different weight of samples, voltage and time for the experiment.  Two methods for hydrogen measurement were used. The first method was a hydrogen production measurement using mass change (weighting before and after experiment). The experimental apparatus was left for a 24h period on scales
