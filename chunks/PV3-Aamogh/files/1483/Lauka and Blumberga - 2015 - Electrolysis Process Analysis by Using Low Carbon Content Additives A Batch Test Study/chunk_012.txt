or dehydrogenating or hydrogenating or oxidizing, and physical properties like porosity, high surface area, thermal and electrical conductivity and attrition resistance. There are large groups of catalysts which correspond to oxides, mixed oxides, zeolites, clays and 
mesoporous materials [7]. Biomass ash, especially wood ash has a high degree of alkalinity [8]. As the wood ash has an alkaline environment and similarities to zeolites structure it may be used in electrolysis process as solid elec
