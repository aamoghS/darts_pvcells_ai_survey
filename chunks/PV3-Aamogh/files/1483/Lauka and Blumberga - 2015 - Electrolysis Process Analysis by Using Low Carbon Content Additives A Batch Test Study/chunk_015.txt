ibilities of ash use as an electrolyte component. The second step included definition of factors, where the experimental results can be affected by quantitative and qualitative factors, which 
can be controlled or uncontrolled. There are four factors, which are chosen for the experiment plan: temperature, composition of sample (mixture, %), sample diameter and moisture content. Through the pilot experiment it was 
ascertained that the analyzed sample creation depends on the selected temperature
