shown in Fig. 3(a)-(c). In Fig. 2(b), the specific IR peak is due to the intra-molecular cyclic hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3(d)), consistent with the observation of the 2360 cm-1 band in [8] [9]. The absorbance intensity of 3745 cm-1(germinal OH vibration) is higher than 3652 and 3622 cm-1 (inter-molecular cyclic configuration OH vibration). This can be supported by the following argument; due to the large O
