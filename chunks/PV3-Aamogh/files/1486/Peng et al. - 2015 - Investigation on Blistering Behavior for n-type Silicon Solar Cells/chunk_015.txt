 layer due to the high firing temperature. If the oxide layer is thick enough to trap or “dissolve” the hydrogen species, the hydrogen will not out-diffuse to the ARC layer and stuck on the top of the surface, resulting in blistering. 3.2.
 
Electrical properties In the following part, we compared the implied VOC between the two annealing recipes just after the simulated firing process. Fig. 4 shows that the thermal treatment B has a higher implied Voc than A. This is because the fir
