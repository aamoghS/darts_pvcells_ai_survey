roscopy is sensitive to OH-related functional groups and gives information about hydrogen's bonding state. Fig. 2 shows FTIR spectra of the samples. Silanol groups (Si-OH) [5, 6, 7] are one of the major indicators that the hydrogen species are trapped by the oxide layer, which formed after the thermal treatment. The assignations for the four spectral components in Fig. 2(a) are listed in Table 1, and the corresponding bonding 
configurations are shown in Fig. 3(a)-(c). In Fig. 2(b), the specific
