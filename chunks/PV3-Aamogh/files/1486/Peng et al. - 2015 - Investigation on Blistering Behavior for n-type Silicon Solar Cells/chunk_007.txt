ermal treatment in specific gas environment is proposed to eliminate blistering. 2.
 
Experiment In this study, 6-inch n-type Cz silicon wafers with a thickness of 180 
�˛
m were used. After texturing, the wafers were then doped with boron for front emitter, and with phosphorous for back surface field. The samples were then deposited with Al
2O3
 using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) [4]. Finally, a SiN

 ARC layer was deposited on the samples using PECVD. The samples were fired in an industri
