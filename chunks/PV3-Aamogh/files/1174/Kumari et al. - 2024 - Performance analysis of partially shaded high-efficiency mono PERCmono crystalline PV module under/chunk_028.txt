rtial shade hinders the PV performance and damages or degrades the module over  time12. According to Lappalainen etal., the partial shading is primary reasons of mismatch losses observed in a PV system. e sharp shadows create the largest mismatch loss. ese types of shadows are major issues on the roof top as well as residential  installations13.Partial shadows created by moving clouds are of great concern in large-scale PV setups, creating mild irradi-ance variations among adjacent PV modules
