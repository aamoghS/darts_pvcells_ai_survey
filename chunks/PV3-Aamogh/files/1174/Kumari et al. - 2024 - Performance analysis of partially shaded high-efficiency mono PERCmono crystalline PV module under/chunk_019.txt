 monocrystalline PV technologies. A research study presented by authors DC Jordan etral., presented that hotspot are major concerns over past decade in installed PV system. Single cell shading is very crucial point to consider as it is related with turning ON of protecting during hotspot development in a PV system. However, it is been observed that a vast study is been done either on small wattage solar panel and individual solar cell inside laboratory or the research is been conducted on a comm
