 exhibit a signicant increase in temperature. e impact of dierent shading proles is observed by analysing the electrical parameters and curves and elevated temperature recorded by the data acquisition system available at the laboratory.Experimental analysis of outdoor testingApart from power loss, shading can have multiple consequences, and one of the most destructive consequences can be the development of hotspots. e hotspot temperature and its dwell time vary with the respective cells and
