ut and better functioning scenario in partial shading conditions. e technique showed better power generation in dynamic and static partial conditions and mismatch losses get minimised with its  implementation39. All these progressions together aim addressing the problem of hotspot and mitigating the development of hotspot.Fundamental details to estimate hotspot temperatureReverse biasing of a solar cell leads to power dissipation that could accelerate ageing and increase failure rates in PV  mo
