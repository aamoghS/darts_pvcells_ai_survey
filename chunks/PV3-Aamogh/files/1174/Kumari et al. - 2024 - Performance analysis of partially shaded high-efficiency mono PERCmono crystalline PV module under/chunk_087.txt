e peaks in the IV and PV curves with cellular and vertical type shading but no variation in the curve with horizontal  shading50. Authors Lyden and Haque presented a methodology to estimate the inu-ence of partial shading for operational PV systems. e results conrmed the visible multiple global maximum power points due to shading under rapidly changing irradiance  
conditions51. e authors in their work analysed the impact of shading generated by buildings shading, wire poles shading, pla
