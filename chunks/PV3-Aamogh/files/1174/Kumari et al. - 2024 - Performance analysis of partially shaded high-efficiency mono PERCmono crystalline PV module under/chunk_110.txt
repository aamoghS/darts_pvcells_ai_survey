ined with a combined impact of variable solar irradiance and ambient temperature and temperature of the cell. Low irradiance and high ambient temperature lead to lower eciency. In our experiment, the third factor, that is hotspot due to shading, is considered along with the solar irradiation and ambient temperature.As shown in Fig.12, the eciency is low when the sun rises; however, as the solar radiation becomes stronger with time, the eciency increases. However, an increase in ambient tempe
