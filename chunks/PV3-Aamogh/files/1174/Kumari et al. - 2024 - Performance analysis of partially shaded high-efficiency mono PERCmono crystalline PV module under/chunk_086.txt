rak etal. 2017 demonstrated the inuence of vertical, horizontal, and cellular shading on the output of PV  modules48. e corelation between shaded area and its inuence on output is presented by Galeano etal. 2018. eir ndings showed that rise in shadow coverage inuences the standard shapes of the I curve and minimises the maximum output  current49. Similar results were obtained in a study where the results showed the occurrence of multiple peaks in the IV and PV curves with cellular
