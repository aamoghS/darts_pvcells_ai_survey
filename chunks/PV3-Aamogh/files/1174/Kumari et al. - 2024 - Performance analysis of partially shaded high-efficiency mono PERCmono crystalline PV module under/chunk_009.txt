tems primarily determine their lifetime and reliability. Several studies have indicated that localized overheating, or "hot spots," should receive special attention because it is identied as one of the primary causes of abrupt failures and accelerated aging. One of the primary reasons for hotspots is shading. With this aim, a methodology is developed where the behaviour of a monocrystalline solar module under shading is experimentally analysed under controlled indoor standard testing setup and
