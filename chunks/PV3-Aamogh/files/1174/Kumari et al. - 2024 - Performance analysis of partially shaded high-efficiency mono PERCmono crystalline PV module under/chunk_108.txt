he persistent environmental conditions.e current owing through the entire string drops when even a single solar cell is shaded. As a result, each PV cell in the string will subsequently operate at the current determined by the shaded cell. e conduction of diode depends on the amount of shading and the IÂ–V curve shape of the shaded cell. e inuence on string, however, is not covered by the present experimental analysis and may be included in future research.Figure11 shows the value of maxim
