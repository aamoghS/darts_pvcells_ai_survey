acking system oered more energy output than xed orientation system. e methodology and nding meticulously resulted monocrystalline cell performed better in terms of injecting more energy into the grid and pursue higher performance in all the  orientations42. Conversely Benghanem etal. conducted a similar comparative research study in hot and arid region geographical area characterised by very high solar radiation and temperature. e power losses recorded for monocrystalline modules were more
