e module under single shaded condition ranged from 59 to 62°C during the entire experimental process and did not very much. However, in the last two shading conditions, 80100% of a shaded cell temperature drops and is observed in the range of 6563°C. is occurs due to a sudden drop in photo-generated current. It is very clear from the experiment that the shading percentage from 40 to 60% is a probable partial shading condition when exhibited on a single PV, will cause maximum damage to t
