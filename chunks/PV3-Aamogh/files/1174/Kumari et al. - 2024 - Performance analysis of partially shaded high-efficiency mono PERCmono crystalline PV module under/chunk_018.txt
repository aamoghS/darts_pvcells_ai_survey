re and solar radiation. As solar irradiance uctuates all day long, the IÂ–V and PÂ–V characteristics vary accordingly. Temperature plays yet another critical factor in dening solar cell eAciency. is paper aims to understand how the attributes of the IÂ–V and PÂ–V curves get aected due to shading, specically in Mono PERC PV modules under STC conditions and outdoor conditions. ereaer, to conclude the potential development of hotspots in PERC monocrystalline PV technologies.
