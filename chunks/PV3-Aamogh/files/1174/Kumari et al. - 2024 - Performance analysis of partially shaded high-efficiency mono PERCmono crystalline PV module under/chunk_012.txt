age. e IÂ–V characteristic of a whole PV module comes from the IÂ–V characteristics of the constituent solar cell.A typical currentÂ–voltage (IÂ–V) and powerÂ–voltage (PÂ–V) curve of the cell, module, or array is shown in Fig.T2b. FigureT2b shows that both the curves IÂ–V curve does not have any multiple steps and the PÂ–V curve has (1)
