rds partial shading and hotspot development.2.  Electrical and thermal responses PV Modules as well as the severity of shading of single cell in high eAciency PERC Modules.3.  With the aid of data acquisition systems, the experiments are continuously monitored and the various read-ings of temperature, output power, eAciency is recorded during the day.4.  e inuence of type of PV technology, amount of shading, critical shading percentage is presented in the study. is study is important for rese
