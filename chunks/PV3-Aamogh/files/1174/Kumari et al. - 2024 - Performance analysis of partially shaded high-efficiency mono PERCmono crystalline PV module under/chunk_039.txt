ency and severity, hotspot has emerged as one of the prevalent modes of degradation in installed PV  systems30. However, some authors used a bypass diode to reduce the hotspot mechanism. e concept of bypass diode was initially proposed in the year 1982 to reduce power loss and hotspot  conditions31.e temperature in hotspot areas may even rise over 100Â°C, which further leads to other degradations like breakage of glass and browning discoloration, and it may even induce re in severe  cases32.
