 under a shaded scenario. e measured temperature of the shaded cell through the day is important to attain a corelation between shade-aected PV cells, bypass diode, and increase in temperature. Furthermore, experi-ments performed in the laboratory will provide basic information about the possibility of hotspot occurrence in shaded cells subsequently supported by outdoor testing. e detailed experimental setup is explained below.e experimental approach adopted to determine the corelation betwe
