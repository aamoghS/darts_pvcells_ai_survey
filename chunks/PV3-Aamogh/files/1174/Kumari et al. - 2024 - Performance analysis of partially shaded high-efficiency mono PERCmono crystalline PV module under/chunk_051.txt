PV cell temperature as a function of Solar irradiation ( 
Tcell)
 only.e expression for computing 
THS(t)
 is explained in the equation:where  = 
S
irr−shaded
Sirr
 shows the relative mismatch condition in the solar irradiance between shaded ( 
Sirr−shaded)
 and the uniformly illuminated cell that is unshaded ( 
Sirr
).Equationi(9) represents the condition before a hot spot condition develops ( 
t<tHS
 ); during this moment, the temperature of the whole module PV cell is constant and can b
