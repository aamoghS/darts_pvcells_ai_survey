ecreased when a large cell area was  shaded61. Shaded cells can act as resistive loads, converting the absorbed sunlight into heat instead of electricity. is localized increase in heat can create  hotspots35,62. At the shading proles of 40% to 60%, the maximum temperature of 30.6°C is recorded in the shaded cell. However, upon further shading, the temperature of the shaded cell starts reducing and reaches 30.3°C. At full coverage, the temperature elevation nearly disappeared. As observed f
