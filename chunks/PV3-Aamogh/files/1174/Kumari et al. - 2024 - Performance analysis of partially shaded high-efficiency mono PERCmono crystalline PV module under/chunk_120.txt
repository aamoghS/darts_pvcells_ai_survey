se in temperature up to 80.7Â°C in 3 Ã— 1 string under dierent partial shading  condition74. e work pre-sented in this paper is closely parallel to the work done by S.Ahsan etal. where similar testing methodology in conventional crystalline silicon modules. e hotspot temperature of 86.6Â°C is recorded under partial shading  condition75. It is evident that the results correlates with the nding available in the literature however this paper strictly focusses on single cell shading on new co
