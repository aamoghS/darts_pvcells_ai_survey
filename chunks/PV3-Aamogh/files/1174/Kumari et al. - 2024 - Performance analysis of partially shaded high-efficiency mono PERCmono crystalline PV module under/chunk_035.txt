ventional eld installed modules, addressing partial shading in BIPV is still a new emerging research area. Authors Q. Li etal. presented their remarkable work where a multi-physics mathematical model is presented to foresee the performance of electrical, thermal and structural parameters under three conditions like no-shading, shading and masking and predicts when the hot-spot occurs in BIPV  technology26. Yet a signicant research regard-ing power output prediction in partially shaded BIPV is
