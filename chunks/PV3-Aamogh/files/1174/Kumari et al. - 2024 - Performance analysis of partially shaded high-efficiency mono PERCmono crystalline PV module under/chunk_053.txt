 ). Under this condition, two phenomena are noticed: the shaded PV cell is impacted by reduced solar irradiation,
Sirr,
 and contribution of power dissipation through 
Rsh
 . he reduction in solar irradiation tends to reduce the temperature with time, while the power dissipation causes an increase in temperature. It has been well observed in the available literature that the power dissipation through 
Rsh
 is more dominant than primary phenomena causing temperature
