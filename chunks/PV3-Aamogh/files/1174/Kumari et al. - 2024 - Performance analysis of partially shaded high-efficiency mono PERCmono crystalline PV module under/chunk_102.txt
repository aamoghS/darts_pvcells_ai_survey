emperature is observed when the shading is increased from 40 to 60%, and the recorded values are 85.5°C and 90.1°C, respectively while the indoor experiments resulted maximum temperature of 30.6°C. However, when the module was operating outdoors, it was anticipated that the shaded cell temperature would rise more under shading  scenarios64,65. Not much variation is noted in the module temperature. During the entire day the temperature of the module under single shaded condition ranged from
