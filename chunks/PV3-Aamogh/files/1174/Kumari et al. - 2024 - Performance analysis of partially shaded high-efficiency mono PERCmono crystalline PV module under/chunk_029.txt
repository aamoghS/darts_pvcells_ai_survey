d irradi-ance variations among adjacent PV modules. Mohammedi A. etal., 2014 presented the complexity and substantial impact of shadowing. eir research work showed that several partially shaded arrays can impact the output more severely than one completely shaded  array14. Another research article conrmed the power loss of up to 10% to 70% due to  shading15.e connection conguration in a module is one of the signicant factors that impact the outputs under shad-ing. However, Vigni etal., 20
