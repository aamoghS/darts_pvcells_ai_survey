n illuminated solar cell is called the maximum power point 
Pmax
.ae additional parameter sets the maximum power generated with the product of Voc and Isc and is called the Fill Factor (FF).e ratio of the useful output power (delivered by the conversion device) to the incident power (of the solar radiation) is called the eciency ( 
Î·
 ) of a solar cell.S = solar irradiation (W/m2), 
Ar
 = module surface area  (m2).e dependability and performance of PV modules may be severely aected by the f
