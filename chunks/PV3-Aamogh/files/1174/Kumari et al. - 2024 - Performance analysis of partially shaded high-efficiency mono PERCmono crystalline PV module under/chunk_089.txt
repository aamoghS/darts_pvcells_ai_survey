erent shading proles, respectively.Interpretation of electrical characteristics obtained from indoor experimente IÂ–V and PÂ–V curves represents the electrical characteristics of PV module. ese curves have a standard shape under healthy working conditions. Any kind of faults in PV module, distorts IÂ–V and PÂ–V curves from their actual shapes. e graphs in Figs.9 and 10 show visible steps and notches in IÂ–V and PÂ–V curves, respec-tively. According to literature, the results in Figs.9 and
