ccording to literature, the results in Figs.9 and 10 are clear indications of mismatch due to shading in the PV  module47,54Â–57. e maximum power point (MPP) in a PV system, method monitors the instances where the maximum power is produced. Under no-fault conditions, there is just a single maximum point, as demonstrated in Fig.8. While under shading, the PV panel has multiple operating points, which can be seen in this paper as well in Fig.10. Under such conditions, the MMP tracker nds it c
