 responses. e hotspot of 145Â°C temperature was observed in the study, along with the variation in the cell characteristics during  
shading35. In addition, the presence of shading creates the chances of generations of hotspots that may cause the development of multiple peaks in the cell characteristics that directly impact the output generations and drop the life expectancy of the PV  module36. With the technology advancement there are many cutting-edge techniques aim to increase the resilien
