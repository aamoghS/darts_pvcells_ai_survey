 by cov-ering 20% of the cell area, then 40%, 60%, and 80%. Finally, the complete shading is done by covering 100% of the area of the selected cell.e implemented shading pattern is shown in Fig.6and thearrangement of outdoor experimental setup is explainedin Fig.7. eir respective electrical characterization results are demonstrated in Figs.8,9 and 10, respectively. Outdoor experimental setupe experiment is conducted in the outdoor testing setup at Terawatt Testing and Research Institut
