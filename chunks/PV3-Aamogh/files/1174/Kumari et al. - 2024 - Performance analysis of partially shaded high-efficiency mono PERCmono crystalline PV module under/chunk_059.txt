 very dierently when installed in outdoor conditions. Due to variable solar radiation and ambient temperature, the shading may impact the eciency and performance of photovoltaic modules Under elded conditions. Hence, during outdoor test-ing, the impact of shading is analysed under various shading scenarios. Aer that, possibilities for the develop-ment of hotspots are analysed. Along with this, various electrical parameters and electrical characteristics are noted. It should be noted that for
