odule is exposed to ash test analysis, which will conrm the accuracy as mentioned in the datasheet. Aer that, the PV module is tested with the ash test for dierent partial shading conditions which is explained next section.e outdoor work intends to form a bridge between STC data collected from the laboratory and yield of the partially shaded PV module. ough experiments performed indoor oers a highly controlled setup, the results may dier in the external environments due to varying ambie
