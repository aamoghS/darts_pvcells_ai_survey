The grid layout consisted of 90 fingers as well as 3 busbars with optimized design to reduce paste consumption and shadowing. Starting from 55μm finger screen opening, we compere 49-μm to 45-μm finger openings for this investigation. Both groups consisted of about 50 solar cells each. The resulting grid lines and IV-data are displayed in Fig. 2 left and right, respectively. The smallest screen opening allowed for a
