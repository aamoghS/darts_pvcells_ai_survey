SH,em and emitter saturation current density J0e can be modified by improved P-diffusion [4] and surface passivation. In Fig. 3 we compare different options for the emitter, including selectively versus directly contacted emitters and different front side passivation options. For the determination of the emitter saturation current density J0e high-ohmic Cz wafers are used which are textured,
