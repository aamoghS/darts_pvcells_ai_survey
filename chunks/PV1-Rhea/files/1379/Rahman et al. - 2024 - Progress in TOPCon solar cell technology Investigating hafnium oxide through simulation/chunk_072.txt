ciency. Comparing the simulation results of SiO2 and HfO2 passivated TOPCon solar cells helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each material [25]. It allows for optimizing parameters like layer thickness, interface quality, and electrical properties to achieve the highest efficiency. It also aids in identifying the material that provides superior p
