wards achieving global sustainable energy goals. Hafnium oxide (HfO2) is being explored as a superior alternative to silicon oxide (SiO2) in the manufacturing of TOPCon solar cells. The stability of HfO2 under thermal and chemical stress contributes to the cells’ longevity [13]. These attributes suggest HfO2’s potential to improve interface quality with silicon, promising a significant boost in the performance and durability of TOPCon solar cells. Diagrams illus
