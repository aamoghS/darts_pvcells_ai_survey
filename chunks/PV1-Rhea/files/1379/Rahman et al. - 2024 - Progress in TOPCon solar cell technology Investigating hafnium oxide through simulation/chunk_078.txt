ovided figure illustrates the simulated structure of a Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cell with layers passivated by Hafnium Oxide (HfO
2
). Hereâ€™s a possible explanation for each part of the figure: a) Depicts the overall structure of the solar cell, with layers of materials including the passivating HfO
2 
layer represented. b) Focuses on the top inter
