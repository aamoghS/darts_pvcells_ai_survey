nd the reduction of recombination losses [22]. It also assesses the optical properties, light absorption, and transmission characteristics of the SiO2 layer to optimize its thickness for improved light trapping and photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (Fig. 4). Each layerâ€™s color corresponds to a different material, as noted in the legend, with specific attention to the placement and role of SiO
