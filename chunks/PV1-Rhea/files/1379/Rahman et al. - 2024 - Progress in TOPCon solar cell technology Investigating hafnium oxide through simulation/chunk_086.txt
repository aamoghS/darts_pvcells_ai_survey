band diagram of tunnel oxide passivating contact structure. Fig. a) presents an energy band diagram of a multi-layered semiconductor structure. It maps the energy levels across p-type polysilicon, silicon dioxide, and n-type polysilicon on an n-type crystalline silicon substrate. The bands displayed are critical for visualizing electron behavior in the material conduction band (E
C
) for electrons, the valence band (E
V
) for holes, and the Fermi level (E
F
),
