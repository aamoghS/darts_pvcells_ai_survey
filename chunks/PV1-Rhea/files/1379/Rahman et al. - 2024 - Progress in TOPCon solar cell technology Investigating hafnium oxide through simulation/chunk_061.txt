 interfaces of the silicon wafer. Accurate modeling of the material properties, including dielectric constants, refractive indices, and interface charges, is imperative to portray their interactions realistically [36]. Interface configuration detailing, such as specifying interface traps and defect densities, is crucial for accurately representing the interactions between passivation layers and the silicon substrate, aiming to simulate reduced recombination rates and improved carrier lifetime.
