mance in a solar cell [30]. For example, HfO2 stands out with its high relative permittivity and distinct electron tunnel mass, suggesting it may offer enhanced passivation effects [31–33]. These attributes are critical for predicting how each material influences electron tunneling efficiency and the overall effectiveness of the cell’s passivation layer [28].
