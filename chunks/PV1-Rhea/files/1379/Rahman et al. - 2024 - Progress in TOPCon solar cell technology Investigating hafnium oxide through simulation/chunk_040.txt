 the valence band remains mostly unoccupied. Photons excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, contributing to the cellâ€™s current flow [10]. Conversely, p-type cells exhibit a valence band predominantly occupied by holes, while the conduction band remains mostly unoccupied. Photon absorption gen
