was investigated on a symmetric 
passivated 
J
0e
 
sample using lifetime calibrated 
photoluminescence imaging (PL).
 
The light and dark 
I

V
 
characteristics of the solar cells were 
measured using the LOANA
 
setup
 
from pv
-
tools. 
To further 
analyse the performance of the solar cells, 3D device simulations 
using Quokka
 
v3
 
were performed. The input parameters, e.g. 
J
0e
,
 
J

,
LCO
,
 
were determined from 
J

samples
