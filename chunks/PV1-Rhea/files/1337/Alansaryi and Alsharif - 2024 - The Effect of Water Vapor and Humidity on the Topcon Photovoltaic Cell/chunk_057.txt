riginal PV power generation, respectively. In addition to being a crucial component in the 
forecasting and sche
duling of PV power generation, the quantitative analysis of haze on PV power can serve as a 
solid foundation for the economic assessment of new PV systems [25].
 
The number of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems being installed is rising quickly as a sustainable energy source, 
but environmental factors like dust, bushfire smoke, and urban haze can cause low irradiance conditions and
