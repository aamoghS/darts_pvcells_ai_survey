gress. Moisture in EVA encapsulant can cause adhesion and optical losses, delamination and 
discoloration of encapsulants, corrosion of metal gr
ids, and potential induced degradation. Among the methods 
used to find moisture intrusion in modules are dark lock in thermography, photoluminescence, ultraviolet 
fluorescence, and electroluminescence spectroscopy. There are several methods to prevent or d
etect moisture 
ingression in PV modules, including encapsulants with superior moisture barrier
