me of the techniques used to stop or identify moisture ingression in PV modules [12]. One of the primary 
factors 
linking weather patterns to module deterioration is moisture intrusion. This is facilitated by high humidity 
and temperature levels. Temperature and moisture intrusion have a significant impact on several life

material deterioration in solar cells and modules. In addition to 
environmental and climatic factors, the properties of t
