increases to 50.7 fA/cm 2 on textured silicon surfaces after printing the Ag contacts, which is still manageably 
less for metal contacts. When this structure was used on Topcon solar cells, the cells independently 
produced a 
highest efficiency of 24.58% and a median efficiency of 23.91%. Interdigitated back
