bject and the results reached, the study proposes a 
number of recommendations, including the following:
 
•
 
Protect solar energy units by placing appropriate insulation materials in order to protect them from bad 
weather factors, especially heavy rain and high humidity.
 
•
 
Place the solar energy cells at an appropriate inclination angle in order to avoid the bad effects of 
humidity and rain and to make the most possible use of the sun’s rays.
 
•
 
Conducting more future experime
