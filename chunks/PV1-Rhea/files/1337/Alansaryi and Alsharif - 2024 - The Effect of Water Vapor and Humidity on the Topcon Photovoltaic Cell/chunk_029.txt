Q1. What is the effect of water vapor and humidity on the Topcon cell? 
 
Literature Review 
 
It has been discussed the use of a tunnel oxide layer less than 2 nm thick to achieve passivated contact in 
sophisticated, high
-
efficiency silicon solar cells based on the full back surface field (BSF). Through interface 
passivation, the insertion of the tunnel oxide layer resulted in a significant impr
