tudy explores this effect experimentally. Dew formation is common in a variety of 
climates, including semi

arid areas 
that are ideal for the installation of PV cells. Because of optical effects, droplets 
on the surface of solar cells can have a negative impact on the efficiency and generation of power within the cell. 
In order to cover semi

transparent glass covers, acryl
ic droplets with a contact angle of 25° to 77° and a surface 
area coverage of 19% to 49% were prepared, either wit
