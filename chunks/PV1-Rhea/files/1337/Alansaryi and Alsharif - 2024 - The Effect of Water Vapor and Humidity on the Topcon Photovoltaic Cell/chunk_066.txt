t angles θi ≤ 30°. Nevertheless, the presence of droplets resulted in a 
significant decrease in the PV cells' maximum power and energy conversion efficiency for incident angles θi > 
30°, especially when it came to l
arge droplet contact angles and/or surface area coverage. The reason for this 
decline in performance was that the light from the incident source was refracted through the droplets rather than 
being completely absorbed by the solar cell at the cover/air int
erface. The study
