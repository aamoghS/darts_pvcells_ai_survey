d that a significant reduction in 
energy is observed at a power output of 0.43 
W for every 1 API point increment. In order to support the adoption 
of PV technology in the ASWAN region, this value provides such tangible evidence of additional factors that 
should be taken into account in PV modeling [27].
 
Through dropwise condensation or rain falling on their cover, droplets can affect the performance of solar 
photovoltaic (PV) cells. This study explores this effect experimentally. Dew form
