 to find moisture intrusion in modules are dark lock in thermography, 
photoluminescence, ultraviolet fluorescence, and electr
oluminescence spectroscopy. There are several methods 
to prevent or detect moisture ingression in PV modules, including encapsulants with superior moisture barrier and 
adhesion properties, desiccant
