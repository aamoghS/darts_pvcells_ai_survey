Currently, the most important work in silicon photovoltaic research and development is bridging the performance 
of poly silicon passivating contacts and developing a blatant passivating contact that is scientifically feasible. 
Crystalline silicon solar cel
ls are the industry standard in the solar industry. Double

sided contacted cells are the 
preferred option for industrial production because they are less complex and exhibit higher efficiency than 
interdigitated
