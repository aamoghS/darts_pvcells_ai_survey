on the performance of photovoltaic
 
cells and panels. As an example, the generation of photovoltaic (PV) power 
is significantly affected by haze. There aren't many quantitative studies on how haze affects PV power generation, 
but when fine particulate matter concentrations rise, it becomes 
the primary factor affecting solar irradiance and 
significantly lowers PV power generation. Moisture and humidity can leads also to degradation of photovoltaic 
cells and panels due to corrosion process.
