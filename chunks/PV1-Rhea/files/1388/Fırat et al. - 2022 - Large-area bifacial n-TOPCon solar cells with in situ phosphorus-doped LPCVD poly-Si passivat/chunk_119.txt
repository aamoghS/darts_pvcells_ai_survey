the interconnections, raising the rs of the laminates to ~1.5 Ω∙cm2, which is significantly higher than the rs of the solar cells before lamination. Investigating the impact of the performed tests on the I-V parameters of the laminates shows that, for the laminate subjected to the damp heat test, the 1% relative increase in Pout originates mainly from an increase in Jsc, from 38.7 mA/cm2 to 39 mA/cm2. This improvement in Jsc is not well-understood. For the thermal cycling, the evolution of Po
