ers the prospect of simplifying the manufacturing of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells, by eliminating the need for an external doping process, prevalent in the industry today. In this work, the potential of in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films was demonstrated at solar cell and laminate level, by integrating them in passivating contacts at the rear side of large-area bifacial n-TOPCon devices. To achieve the highest efficiencies possible, the solar cell design was optimized starting with an invest
