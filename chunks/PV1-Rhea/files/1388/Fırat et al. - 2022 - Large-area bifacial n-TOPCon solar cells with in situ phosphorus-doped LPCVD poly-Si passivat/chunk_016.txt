m-3 and an rdep of 0.078 nm/s [26]. This represents a ~53% drop in rdep with respect to the LPCVD of intrinsic Si at the same temperature (590Â°C), which corresponds to an increase of the time required for the deposition of a typical 150 nm thick Si film by only ~17 min, from ~15 min for the growth of intrinsic poly-Si to ~32 min in case of in situ doping [26]. Moreover, by combining the poly-Si films developed in our previous work with thermally grown interfacial SiOx layers and applying post-L
