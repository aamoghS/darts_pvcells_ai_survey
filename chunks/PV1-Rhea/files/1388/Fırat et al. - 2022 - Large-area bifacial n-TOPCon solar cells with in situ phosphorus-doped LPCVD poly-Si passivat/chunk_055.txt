 case of e.g., J0,E and contact resistivity, and design parameters, in case of e.g., contact half widths, whenever available, and were otherwise chosen reasonably in order to match the I-V parameters of the best solar cell. For the input parameters not listed in Table 1, the defaults of the Quokka settings file generator were used.  Table 1. Input parameters for Quokka 2 simulations to match the best solar cell fabricated in this work with a tpoly of 150 nm, polished rear surface, and single ARC
