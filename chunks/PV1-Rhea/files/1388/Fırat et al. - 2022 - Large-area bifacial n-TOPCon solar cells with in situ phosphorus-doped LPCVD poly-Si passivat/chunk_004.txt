3 cm2) bifacial n-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (n-TOPCon) solar cells with diffused front emitter and screen-printed contacts. In situ doped poly-Si films are studied as their use could simplify the production of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells compared to the common approach relying on ex situ doping of intrinsic LPCVD poly-Si films. The developed poly-Si passivating contacts exhibited excellent characteristics with low recombination current densities in passivated and screen-printing m
