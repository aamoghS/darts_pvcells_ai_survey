ii) the screen-printed finger widths (wf, wr) and pitches (pf, pr), (iv) tpoly, (v) reflectance R by the use of DARC, (vi) the passivation of the non-contacted regions of the front side by the use of an advanced emitter, (vii) the passivation of the contacted regions of the front side by the use of a selective emitter, and (viii) again the front surface passivation in non-contacted regions using a transparent passivating contact. The Quokka 2 input parameters varied in each step are listed in Ta
