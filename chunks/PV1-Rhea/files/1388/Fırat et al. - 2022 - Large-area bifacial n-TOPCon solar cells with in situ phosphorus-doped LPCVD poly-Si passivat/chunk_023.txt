The goal of the first experiment was to study the impact of tpoly on the solar cell performance and identify the optimal tpoly value. This experiment is referred to as the tpoly screening experiment. For this purpose, solar cells with a large area of 241.3 cm2 were prepared using n-type Cz wafers with the structure illustrated in Fig. 1a), following the process flow in Fig. 1b). After random pyramid texturing and cleaning, a ~1 Âµm-deep homogeneous p-type emitter with a sheet resistance of 110 Î
