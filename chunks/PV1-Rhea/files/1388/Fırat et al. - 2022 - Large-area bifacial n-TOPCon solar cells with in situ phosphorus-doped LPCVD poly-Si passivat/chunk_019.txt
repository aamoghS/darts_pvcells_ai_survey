t peak than the devices with conventional ex situ doped passivating contacts, if the annealing in case of in situ doping can be optimized to yield a shorter and leaner process [17,27]. Moreover, a simpler single-step process may still be achieved in case of in situ doping either by developing LPCVD equipment which can perform the annealing also in situ, or by means of the fired passivating 
contact concept, which eliminates the annealing and relies on the firing step used for screen-printed meta
