e morphology screening experiment. For this, a reference group of 7 solar cells was prepared with the same design and process as for the tpoly screening experiment i.e., the rear surface morphology was semi-textured. For this reference group, a single tpoly value of 150 nm was chosen. In addition, another group of 14 solar cells was fabricated, also with tpoly = 150 nm but a polished rear surface morphology. The design of these solar cells is also the one depicted in Fig. 1a) and the fabrication
