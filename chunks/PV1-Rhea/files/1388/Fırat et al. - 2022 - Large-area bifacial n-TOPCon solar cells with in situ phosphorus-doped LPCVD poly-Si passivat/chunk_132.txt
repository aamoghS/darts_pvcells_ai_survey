is not suitable for module applications. Lastly, steps 6, 7, and 8 of the roadmap foresee the reduction in recombination losses at the front surface of the solar cell. In step 6, the losses in the non-metallized regions are decreased using a deeper, advanced emitter. The advanced emitter is known to yield a lower J0,p,f of 16 fA/cm2 [48], and results in 3 mV higher Voc and 0.1% higher Î·. In step 7, recombination losses in the metallized regions are reduced by introducing a selective emitter. Th
