tep of the roadmap assessed the improvement achievable by improving the wafer quality. As Fig. 13 shows, the use of wafers with τB = 8 ms leads to a significant η gain of 0.9% due to the FF and the Voc increasing by 1.9% and 9 mV, respectively. It is interesting to note that most of this gain (0.7% in η) can be obtained already for τB = 4 ms, showing that the increase in η with τB has a saturating behavior. Step 2 and 3 of the roadmap shows that η can then be increased by 0.4%, to above 2
