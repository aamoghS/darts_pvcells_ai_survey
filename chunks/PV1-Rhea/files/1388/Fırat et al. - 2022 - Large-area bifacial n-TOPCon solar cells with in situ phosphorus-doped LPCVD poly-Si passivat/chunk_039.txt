ments were characterized by current-voltage (I-V) measurements under 1 sun illumination with the AM1.5 G spectrum using a Wacom solar simulator and a GridTouch system by Pasan to contact the zero-busbar devices. These measurements were performed both with front and rear illumination. In case of the solar cells with a DARC, I-V measurements were repeated after the realization of the DARC, and the best solar cell was also sent to ISFH CalTeC for a calibrated I-V measurement. From the I-V measureme
