een-printed at the rear and front sides, respectively, followed by firing of the pastes through the SiNx:H films for realizing contacts with the poly-Si and the emitter. Firing was performed with a belt speed of 150 inches per minute and a set peak temperature of 855°C.  �The focus of the second experiment was to investigate the impact of the rear surface morphology on the n-TOPCon solar cells. This experiment is referred to as the rear surface morphology screening experiment. For this, a ref
