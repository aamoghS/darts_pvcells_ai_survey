s due to the 0.7% jump in FF, which follows from the lower rs of 0.6 Ω∙cm2, and is attributed to the improved screen-printing process, yielding little to no finger interruptions as found by optical microscopy. The reason for the limited gain in η despite this significant FF increase seems to be the drop in Voc by 2.4 mV. To understand this loss in Voc, PL images of monitor samples from the tpoly screening and rear surface morphology screening experiments were compared. The design of the moni
