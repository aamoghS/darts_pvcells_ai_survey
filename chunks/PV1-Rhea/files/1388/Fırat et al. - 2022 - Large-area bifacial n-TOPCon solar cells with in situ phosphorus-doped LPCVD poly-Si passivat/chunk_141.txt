ests, Pout of the laminates did not degrade but increased by 1-2%. Hence, the laminates passed the tests, indicating that the developed solar cells can be suitable for use in PV modules.  Lastly, the ultimate efficiency potential of n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts was predicted by establishing a roadmap to an Î· of 25.5% using Quokka 2 simulations. Among the strategies outlined in the roadmap, the most effective improvements to the solar cell design a
