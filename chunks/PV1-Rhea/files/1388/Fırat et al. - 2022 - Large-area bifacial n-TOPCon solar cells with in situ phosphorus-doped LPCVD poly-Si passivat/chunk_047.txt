n terms of PL counts. Based on these counts, the findings of the lifetime measurements, and the method described in [35], J0 of the metallized regions (J0,m) was also determined. Furthermore, structures containing fingers with a pitch of 2 mm, and dimensions of 1 cm by ~50 µm were laser-diced from the monitor samples for measuring ρc by the transfer length method (TLM). In the following sections, each of these parameters are reported with an extra index “r” or “f” to indicate that thes
