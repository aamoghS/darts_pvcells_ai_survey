 to be the main factor limiting the Voc of the solar cells. This finding agrees with the results of similar recombination loss analyses reported in the literature for n-TOPCon solar cells [5,16].   �Overall, these results show that a thick enough poly-Si film with tpoly ≥ 150 nm is necessary to achieve high-quality passivating contacts and high-efficiency n-TOPCon solar cells for the screen-printed contacts used. While choosing tpoly > 150 nm results in slightly improved electrical propertie
