l two opposite trends with increasing tpoly, which explain the nonlinear improvement of the average Î·: (i) Jsc drops by ~0.15 mA/cm2 per 50 nm increase in tpoly, and (ii) Voc and FF improve, particularly when tpoly is raised from 100 to 150 nm.

Averages and standard deviations were obtained by measurements on 8 devices per group. Parameters of
