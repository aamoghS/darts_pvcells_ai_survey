verage η lies just below 22%, accompanied by significantly lower average FF values of 79.4% and below. Comparison of the average η as a function of tpoly shows that solar cells with thicker poly-Si films are more efficient, with a significant jump of 0.4% in η for tpoly increasing from 100 to 150 nm, but only a 0.1% improvement when tpoly is further raised to 200 nm. Differences between the other parameters of the three solar cell groups reveal two opposite trends with increasing tpoly, which
