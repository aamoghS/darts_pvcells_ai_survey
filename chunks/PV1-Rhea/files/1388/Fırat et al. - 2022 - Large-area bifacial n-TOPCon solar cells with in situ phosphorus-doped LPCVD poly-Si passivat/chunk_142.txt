 effective improvements to the solar cell design and fabrication process were found to be the use of wafers with higher bulk lifetimes and of advanced and selective emitter as well as transparent passivating contact technologies for enhanced passivation of the front side of the solar cells.  Our future work will focus on following the roadmap established in this paper to achieve the foreseen improvements to Î· experimentally. Furthermore, further simplification of the process used for fabricatin
