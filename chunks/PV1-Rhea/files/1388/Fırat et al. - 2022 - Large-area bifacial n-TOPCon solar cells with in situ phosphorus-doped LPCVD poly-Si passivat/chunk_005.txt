rent densities in passivated and screen-printing metallized regions down to 2.3 fA/cm2 and 65.8 fA/cm2, respectively, and a low contact resistivity of 2.0 mΩ∙cm2. For reaching the best passivating contact characteristics and high solar cell efficiencies, a poly-Si film thickness of 150-200 nm was found to be optimal while a polished rear surface morphology was found to be beneficial. The best solar cell reached a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.01% along with a high open circuit v
