hologies as in Fig. 4a), albeit with a lower drop from FFn to FF than in the tpoly screening experiment, given the lower rs in Table 4 than in Table 3. Furthermore, the minor improvement in FF for the solar cells with polished rear follows from the increase in FFn by the same margin of 0.2% i.e., from enhanced mitigation of recombination losses. This conclusion is supported by the ~45% lower J0,p,r of 2.3 fA/cm2 and J0,m,r of 65.8 fA/cm2 found for the polished monitors, as depicted in Fig. 9a).
