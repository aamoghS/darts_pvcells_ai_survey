es on the firing step used for screen-printed metallization also for the activation of dopants in the Si film [28]. However, these developments are beyond the scope of this work.  This paper reports on the integration of passivating contacts based on in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD at the rear side of large-area bifacial n-TOPCon solar cells. The devices were fabricated relying on industrial methods, using a homogeneous boron-diffused front emitter and screen-printed metallization. Impact
