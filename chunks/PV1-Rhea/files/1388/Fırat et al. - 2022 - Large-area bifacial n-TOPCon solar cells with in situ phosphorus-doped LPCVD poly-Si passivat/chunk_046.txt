nority carrier lifetime (τ) measurements on the passivated regions of the respective monitors by the transient decay method, using a BT Imaging equipment. From the resulting injection level (∆n) dependent lifetime data, J0 of the passivated regions (J0,p) at ∆n = 1016 cm-3 was extracted. Photoluminescence (PL) images of the monitors were also taken using the same BT Imaging equipment, revealing the passivation quality in metallized regions in terms of PL counts. Based on these counts, the f
