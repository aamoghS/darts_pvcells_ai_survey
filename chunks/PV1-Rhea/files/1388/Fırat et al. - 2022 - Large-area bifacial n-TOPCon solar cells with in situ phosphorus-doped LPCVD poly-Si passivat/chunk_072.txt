ged Ag paste, resulting in quite regularly spaced finger interruptions at intervals of a few 100 nm as shown by the microscopy image in Fig. 4b). Poor quality of the metallization being the limiting factor for the FF is also demonstrated by the performance of the best solar cell, on which little to no finger interruptions were found. As a result, the best solar cell has a significantly lower rs of 0.5 Ω∙cm2 and a higher FF of 81.1%. Despite rs-related losses being the dominant mechanism, thes
