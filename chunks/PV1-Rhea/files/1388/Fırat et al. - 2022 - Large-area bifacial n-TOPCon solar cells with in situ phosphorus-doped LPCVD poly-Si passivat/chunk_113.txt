1000 nm. Hence, room for further improvement of the R spectrum, the Jsc, and thus the Î· exists by optimizing the DARC stack.   3.4 Damp Heat and Thermal Cycling Tests on 1-Cell n-TOPCon Solar Laminates The results of the damp heat and thermal cycling tests applied to 1-cell laminates containing the developed n-TOPCon solar cells are shown in Fig. 12. These indicate that Pout of the laminates, initially equal to ~4.9 W, does not drop and even increase by ~1% relative upon 1000 h of damp heat tes
