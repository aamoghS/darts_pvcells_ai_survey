u doping-based approach a two-step process itself as in the case of ex situ doping by dopant diffusion. However, it has been shown in the literature that, while the deposition of in situ doped Si films is more expensive than their intrinsic counterparts due to the reduced rdep in case of in situ doping, the overall cost of ownership of n-TOPCon solar cells incorporating in situ doped poly-Si passivating contacts can be lower by 0.2 $cents per Watt peak than the devices with conventional ex situ
