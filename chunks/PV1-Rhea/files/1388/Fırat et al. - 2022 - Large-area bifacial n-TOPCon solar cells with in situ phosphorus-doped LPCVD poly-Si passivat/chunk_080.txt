surfaces, with the corresponding results on textured surfaces reported in our previous work indicate a good agreement [26]. Despite the reproducibility of the results, it is not well-understood why J0,p,r and ρc,r are lower for higher tpoly. This calls for a more detailed study on the impact of tpoly on the poly-Si film properties such as the doping profile, which is beyond the scope o
