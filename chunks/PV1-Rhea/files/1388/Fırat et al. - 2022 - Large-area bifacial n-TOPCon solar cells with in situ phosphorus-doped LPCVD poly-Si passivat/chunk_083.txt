 results in slightly improved electrical properties of the devices, it also leads to optical losses, showing only marginal improvements in terms of η. It is expected that, for tpoly beyond 200 nm, η might drop due to increased Jsc losses, which might limit the solar cell performance, as shown in the literature [15]. For these reasons, 150 nm was chosen as the poly-Si thickness for the rear surface morphology screening experiment in this work. Apart from the choice of a sufficiently high tpoly,
