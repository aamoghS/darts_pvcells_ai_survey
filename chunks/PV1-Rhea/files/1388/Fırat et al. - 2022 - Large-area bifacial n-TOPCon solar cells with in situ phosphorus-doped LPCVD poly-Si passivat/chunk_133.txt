are reduced by introducing a selective emitter. The selective emitter is assumed to reduce J0,m,f down to 50 fA/cm2, a value possibly achievable with p-type passivating contacts, yielding 7 mV higher Voc and 0.3% higher η, thus reaching η = 25%. While the improvements to the emitter considered in steps 6 and 7 are available technologies and can be used for fabricating solar cells with record efficiencies, it can be difficult to implement those in production, since fabrication of the advanced e
