n-TOPCon solar cells, further investigations such as potential induced degradation and humidity freeze tests are required and will be performed in the future.   Further analysis of the I-V parameters of the laminates leads to a few more conclusions. First, for both laminates, the cell-to-laminate losses were found to be high, with the laminates having ~2% absolute lower η than the cells, equal to 20.1-20.3%. This is expected, as the laminates were not optimized for maximizing the η. Among the
