lume concentrations of 49% HF and 70% HNO3 in the polishing solution were 20% and 80%, respectively. The wafer speed was 1.5 m/min, identical to the emitter removal process, but the process temperature was slightly higher, at 12°C. The polishing process was applied a single time to each wafer, which removes ~6 µm of Si and yields a flatter rear surface, which, however, does not correspond to a mirror-polished surface but exhibits significant roughness [29]. Moreover, on four of the best solar
