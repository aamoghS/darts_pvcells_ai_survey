-type polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) and interfacial SiOx films, which provide low recombination current density (J0) and contact resistivity (ρc) simultaneously [2]. The potential of the n-TOPCon technology has already been demonstrated by the achievement of a record power conversion efficiency (η) of 25.8% with a lab-type small-area solar cell [3], impressive η up to 25.4% with large-area solar cells [4–6], and a high average η exceeding 24% in production [7,8].  In the PV community,
