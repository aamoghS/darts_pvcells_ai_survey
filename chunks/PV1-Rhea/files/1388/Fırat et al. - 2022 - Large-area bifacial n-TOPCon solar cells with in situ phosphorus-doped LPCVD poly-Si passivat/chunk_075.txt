00 to 150 nm arise from enhanced mitigation of recombination losses, yielding a lower n value (see Table 3) and therefore an improvement in FFn.   The positive impact of using a tpoly of 150 nm or higher in mitigating recombination losses was verified by characterizing the symmetrically passivated monitors. The results, depicted in Fig. 5a), show that J0,m,r decreases by more than a factor of 5, to values below 100 fA/cm2, when tpoly is increased from 100 to 150 nm, showing that passivating cont
