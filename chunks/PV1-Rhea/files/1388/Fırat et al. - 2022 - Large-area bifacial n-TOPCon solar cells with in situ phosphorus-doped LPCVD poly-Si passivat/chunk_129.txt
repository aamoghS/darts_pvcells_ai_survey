 that η can then be increased by 0.4%, to above 24%, by (i) reducing ρB to 1 Ω∙cm, and ρc,f and ρc,r to 1 mΩ∙cm2 using improved screen-printing pastes, (ii) further developing the screen-printing process to realize narrower fingers with wf = wr = 20 µm, and (iii) optimizing the grid design for the lower ρc,f and ρc,r by increasing the pitch of the fingers. These improvements mainly affect the FF, yielding a 0.6% increase. In step 4, another η gain of 0.2% is predicted when going fo
