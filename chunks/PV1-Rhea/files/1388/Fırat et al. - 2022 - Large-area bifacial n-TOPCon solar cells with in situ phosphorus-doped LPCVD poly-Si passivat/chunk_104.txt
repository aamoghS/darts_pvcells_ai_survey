 the DARC consisting of a stack of 70 nm SiNx and 90 nm SiOx films on four of the best solar cells with polished rear surface. First, the best solar cell with a certified η of 23.01% and a high Voc of 691.7 mV (see Fig. 10), fabricated with the industrial process in Fig. 1b), clearly demonstrates the potential of passivating contacts with in situ P-doped poly-Si films deposited by LPCVD. This result matches the highest η obtained in the literature with a large-area n-TOPCon solar cell incorpor
