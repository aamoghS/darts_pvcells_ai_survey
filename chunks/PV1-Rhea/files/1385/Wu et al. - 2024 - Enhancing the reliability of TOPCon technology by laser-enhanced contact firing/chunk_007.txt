ing TOPCon cells, facilitated by diverse process and tool developments, position this technology as a potential frontrunner in the global photovoltaic market [6–13]. Despite its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with existing passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) production lines, the widespread commercialization of TOPCon modules has raised concerns regarding their reliability [14–19]. Numerous studies have highlighted potential reliability issues faced by TOPCon solar cells and mod
