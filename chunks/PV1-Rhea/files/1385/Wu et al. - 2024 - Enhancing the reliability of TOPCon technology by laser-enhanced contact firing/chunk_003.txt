 as an appealing alternative to standard one-step cofiring. The main driver for laser-assisted firing is enabling higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE). This technique permits the application of screen printing pastes with considerably reduced levels of aluminum (Al), or even the complete exclusion of Al. Consequently, the enhancement in PCE values may not only boost PCE, but may also offer benefits in terms of reliability. This study investigates the impact of Jolywood Special Injected Met
