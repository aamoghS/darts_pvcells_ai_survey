 front surface of selected samples, after which the samples were left to air dry naturally in a fume cupboard, maintaining room temperature and atmospheric conditions. Care was taken during the solution treatment phase to prevent contamination within and among the samples. After treatment, the samples were positioned vertically within individual polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cassettes, spaced as such to mitigate cross-contamination during the damp-heat testing phase. The DH85 tests were done in
