re was a limited increase compared to the contaminated groups. In the JSIM-control group, the average measured contact resistance (

before testing and slightly increased to ~3.1 mOhmcm

after the 20 h of DH85. Similarly, the Baseline-control group exhibited no significant increase after DH85 testing, with values ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mOhmcm

of Baseline-NaCl dramatically escalated from 1.3 to 200.6 mOhmcm
