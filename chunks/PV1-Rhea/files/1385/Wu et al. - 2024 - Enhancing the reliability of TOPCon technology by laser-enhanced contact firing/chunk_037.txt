 shows a significant increase in R
s 
over the whole solar cell area after 40 h of DH85, consistent with the Iâ€“V changes shown in Fig. 3. The entire metal contacts on the surface were significantly affected by NaCl during DH85 testing. Conversely, the JSIM-NaCl samples did not show any significant degradation. While some regions displayed slight R
s 
increases, the majority of the surface maintained relatively low R
s 
levels. This indicates that the metal con
