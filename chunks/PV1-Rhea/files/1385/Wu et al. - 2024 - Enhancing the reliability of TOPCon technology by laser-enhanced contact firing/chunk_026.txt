images. Subsequent processing of luminescence images was carried out using LumiTools [41]. To evaluate the contact resistance, we specifically focused on the non-busbar regions of the TOPCon cells. Employing a FOBA M1000 scribing laser, we created 6 mm wide stripes for contact resistance assessment. The quantification of contact resistances involved utilizi
