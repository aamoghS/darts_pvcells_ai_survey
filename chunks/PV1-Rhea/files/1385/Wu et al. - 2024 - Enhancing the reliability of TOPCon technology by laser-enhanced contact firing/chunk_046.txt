urfaces. Given that Al can form Ag/Al spikes during the contact firing step [47, 48], corrosion of Al might also alter the interface contact properties, leading to a significant increase in contact resistance as illustrated in Fig. 6 (b). Furthermore, the Pb in Baseline-NaCl exhibited overlap and influence from Cl, potentially a side effect of Al redox reactions. PbO plays a key role in the fritting process as well as in the quality of the contact between silicon and silver. These effects collec
