g better stability compared to their baseline counterparts. The electroluminescence images of JSIM and baseline modules shown in Fig. 9 reveal no discernible differences between the JSIM modules. However, in baseline modules, noticeable failure patterns are evident along the contacts. This serves as additional evidence supporting the long-term stability of JSIM TOPCon cells within G-B modules. 4.Conclusion TOPCon technology is expected to become the dominant technology in 2024 due to its higher
