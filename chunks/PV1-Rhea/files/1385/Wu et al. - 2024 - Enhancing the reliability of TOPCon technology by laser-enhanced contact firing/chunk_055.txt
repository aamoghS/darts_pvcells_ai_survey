ion predominantly affects the series resistance of the solar cells, i.e., affecting the FF of the module. The JSIM modules exhibited a ~0.6%
rel 
FF decline, whereas baseline modules suffered a significantly higher ~4.9%
rel 
FF loss. This is consistent with an increase of R
s 
at the module level due to cell-level contact degradation in baseline modules. Overall, JSIM G-B modules demonstrated superior reliability under DH85 conditions, showcasing better stability compared to their baseline coun
