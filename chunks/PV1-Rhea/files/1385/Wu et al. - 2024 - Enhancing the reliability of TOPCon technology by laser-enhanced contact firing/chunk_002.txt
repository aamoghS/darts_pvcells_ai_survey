can be used. The use of silver/ aluminum (Ag/Al) paste for front-side metallization is identified as a key factor contributing to the relatively poor reliability of TOPCon modules, particularly at high temperatures and humidity. However, very recently, laser-assisted firing techniques such as laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO) that combine conventional co-firing at relatively low temperatures with a subsequent laser treatment have emerged as an appealing alternative to standard one-step
