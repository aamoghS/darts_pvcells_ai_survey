rel 
after the 40-h DH85 test. Notably, the R
s 
of the Baseline-NaCl cells exhibited an approximately ~13,000%
rel 
increase after 40 h. This very high series resistance also affected the measured J
sc 
value as the current extraction of the solar cell was impeded by the higher resistive losses. In contrast, JSIM samples only showed a PCE degradation of approximately ~3.6%
rel 
after 40 h of DH
