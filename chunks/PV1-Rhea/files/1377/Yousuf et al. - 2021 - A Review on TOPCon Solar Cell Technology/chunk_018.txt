ccumulated in a �LPCVD system. The pure poly-silicon is doped in a phosphoryl �chloride (POCl3) diffusion furnace consequently to transform into n+-poly-silicon. Additionally, etching process on single side is processed to eliminate the front side covered with poly silicon. The boron emitter is passivated with film of dielectric layer, subsequently additional RCA cleaning processed, that is �correspondingly work as a coating of anti-reflection layer. The back side SiOx/n+-poly-silicon laye
