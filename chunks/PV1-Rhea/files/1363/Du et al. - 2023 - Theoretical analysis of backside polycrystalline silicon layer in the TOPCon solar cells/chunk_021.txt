everal discrete energy states in the range of 0.2–0.5 eV below the conduction band. Sehil et al. [24] confirmed the existence of grain boundary defect states formed by suspended bonds at 0.40 eV below the conduction band of poly-Si thin film materials by the field effect method. Kim et al. [25] confirmed the existence of high density trap states in the center of the band gap through charge-pump measurement. This result has also been verified by several other experiments [26–29].
