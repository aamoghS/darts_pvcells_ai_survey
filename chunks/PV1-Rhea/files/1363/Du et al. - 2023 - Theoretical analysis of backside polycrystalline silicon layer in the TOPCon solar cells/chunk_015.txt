solar cells FF. Therefore, as the core process of TOPCon solar cells, the backside oxide layer and poly-Si layer have always been the focus of research on TOPCon solar cells [12â€“14]. Unfortunately, there is no perfect explanation of the carrier transport mechanism in the highly doped poly-Si/silicon oxide/monocrystalline silicon structure. It is found that both the silicon oxide layer and the poly-Si layer have an influence on the passivation contact effect, and only when the two structures ar
