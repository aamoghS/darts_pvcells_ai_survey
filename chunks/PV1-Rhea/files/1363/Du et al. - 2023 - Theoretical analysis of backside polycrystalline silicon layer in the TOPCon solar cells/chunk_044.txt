crystalline silicon to emission into poly-Si. In Fig. 7, it can be seen that compared to a defect states concentration of 1E18 in the acceptor-like defect states, when the acceptor-like defect states reaches 1.5E20, the electron concentration in poly-Si decreases by two energy levels, while the charge density in the defect nearly doubles. At the interface between monocrystalline silicon and poly-Si, the number of electrons on the monocrystalline silicon side is signifi
