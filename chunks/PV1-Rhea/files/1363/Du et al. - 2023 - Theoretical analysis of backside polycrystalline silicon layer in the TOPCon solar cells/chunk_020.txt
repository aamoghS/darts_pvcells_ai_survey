tes and acceptor-like defect states. But the actual situation is often more complicated. Chen et al. [22] obtained activation energies in the range of 0.25â€“0.3 eV for poly-Si films prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) by charge pumping method. Armstong et al. [23] similarly confirmed the trap energy level at 0.43 eV below the conduction band by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) spectroscopy and the existence of several discrete energy states in the range of 0.2â
