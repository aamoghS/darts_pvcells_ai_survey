ncentration of defect states in all donor-like defect states at the same time and changing the concentration of defect states in one of them is only the difference in the total number of defect in donor-like defect states. However, in TOPCon solar cells, the influence of defect states concentration of the same order of magnitude on the cells is almost the same. 4.Conclusions The poly-Si on the back has a great impact on the performance of TOPCon solar cells. In the case of narrow band system, th
