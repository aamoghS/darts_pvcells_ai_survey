he development of low-temperature metallization and interconnection procedures, as well as complex patterning strategies for the formation of interdigitated junctions. And from an industrially attractive standpoint, the highest efficiencies have also been maintained for silicon solar cells contacted on both sides, and adopting a full-area charge carrier-selective backside contact is necessary to preserve a potentially lean process sequence. To summarize, Table 1 compares the state-of-the-art in
