fusion to the contact [77,146]. Mallem et al. [149] recently reported on oxygen dilution during the MoO
x 
thin film synthesis by thermal vacuum evaporation, which reduced the WF, and thus, the hole injection efficiency into the contact layer. In sum, oxygen vacancies will significantly modify the MoO

composition, thus affecting the optical absorption, WF, and electrical conductivity of the material. 4.New pathways for passivating contacts While the a-Si:H(i)/MoO
