b and 1c). Ensuring that the interfaces are well-passivated will significantly lessen recombination losses while the incorporation of functional materials for the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer and metallic contacts can enhance carrier collection and minimize resistive losses. In fact, CSCs formed by highly transparent electrodes are heralding a pivotal role in SHJ design that is industrially favored at present. Incorporating a passivating dielectric membrane between the Si rear side a
