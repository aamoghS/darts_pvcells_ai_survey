OPCon and BSF design complement the screen-printed front surface passivating metal contact. 23%-efficiency was demonstrated on p-Si solar cells with full-area hole-selective passivating rear contact realized by a capping SiO

layer on the doped poly-Si film, and also with phos

phorous diffusion for the front side electron-selective contact together with a silicon nitride (SiN
