anced contact-related designs could reduce the opto-electrical losses through high-performance field-effect passivation and carrier-selectivity [93,94]. Besides having the most favorable electrical and optical properties, high thermal resilience and a low temperature coefficient are important features for photovoltaic front contact schemes. To appreciate the importance of accounting for thermal effects, we refer to the simple built-in junction potential model (Eq. 7) in semiconductor engineering
