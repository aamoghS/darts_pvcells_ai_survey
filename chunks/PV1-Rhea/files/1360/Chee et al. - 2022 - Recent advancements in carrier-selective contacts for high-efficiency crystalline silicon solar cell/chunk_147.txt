, as well as the huge cost burden of the ITO processing, propel device technologists to strive for alternative strategies towards less expensive development of the front surface contact of c-Si solar cells. The adoption of ITO as the TCO layer, and copious amounts of Ag paste in front-side metallization, drive up photovoltaic production expenses (due to In scarcity and costs) in CSC te
