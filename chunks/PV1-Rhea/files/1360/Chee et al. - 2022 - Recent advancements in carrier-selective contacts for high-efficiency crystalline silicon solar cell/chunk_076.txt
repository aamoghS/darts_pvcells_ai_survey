tance, with minimal values expected for thinner layers in general. Usually, the effect of oxygen vacancies is to modify the energy band structure and bandgap of TMOs to render them as n-type dielectrics. Nevertheless, Battaglia et al. [75] described a novel approach of using MoO

as the hole-selective p-emitter for n-Si photovoltaics. On the other hand, MoO
