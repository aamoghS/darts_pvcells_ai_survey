ace of ITO on the front side surface, the AZO/SiO
2 
bilayer yielded a J
sc 
improvement by 0.4mA/cm
2 
and a maximum efficiency of 23% for the n-type SHJ solar cell. The AZO was used as the front TCO layer, which was capped with an SiO
2 
layer as the anti-reflection coating, so that these samples demonstrated enhanced stability under damp-heat test conditions. Effective passivation was also demonstrated using spin-coated SiO
x 
layers having thicknesses exceeding 100nm (
