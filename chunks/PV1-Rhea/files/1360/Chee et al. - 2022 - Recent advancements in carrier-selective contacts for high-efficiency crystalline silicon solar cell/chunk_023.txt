Fig. 1.Energy band diagrams illustrating general concepts of the idealized electron (hole) collecting layer/selective contact positioned at the far left (right) on an n-type c-Si wafer for a (a) homojunction, (b) heterojunction, or (c) dopant-free asymmetric heterocontact, structure. Schematics are not drawn to scale.
