ectric passivating layer has been known to increase the carrier lifetime and charge transport, thereby leading to increased J
sc
, V
oc
, and efficiency â€“ a valid premise for dopant-free CSCs. In DASH cells, MoO
x 
and TiO
x 
are popular material candidates for the HCL and ECL, respectively, which realize improvements to the photoelectric parameters through enhanced passivation and carrier-selective properties. Strong contenders arising for the HCL and ECL include VO
