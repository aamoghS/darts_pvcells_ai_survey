may provide different passivation properties depending on whether they are grown by thermal or wet chemical processes. Typi
-
cally, the SiO
x 
layer endows limited chemical passivation but enacts effective field-effect passivation due to the inherent +Q
f
. Finally, the passivation properties may depend on the deposition- and processing-related fixed charge polarity, which differ at the c-Si/ SiO
x 
and c-Si/AlO
x 
interfaces. Thinner ALD-AlO
x 
layers allow greater field-effect passivation tha
