have positive fixed charges [8]. Other key attributes of passivation layers are a high reflective index, a wide bandgap, and high thermal resilience. Such surface and interface passivation layers may be deployed alongside stable poly-Si passivation layers that can withstand industrial firing thermal treatment processes. Thermal deposition, post-annealing, and high-temperature firing (e.g., in
