ers, respectively, have been reported to be vital to establish charge carrier asymmetry to enhance electrical conduction - a principle which is also equally applicable to p- or n-type a-Si:H [8]. Such passivation stacks are not only required to induce charge accumulation (majority carriers) but also charge inversion (minority carriers), at the surface.
