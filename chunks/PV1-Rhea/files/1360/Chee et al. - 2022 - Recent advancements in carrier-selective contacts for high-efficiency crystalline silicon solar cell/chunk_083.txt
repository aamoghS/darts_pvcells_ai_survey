 where A is the contact area and A* is the Richardson constant. Whereas the material WF or 

c 
is determined by the active dopant concentration, carrier selectivity is dictated by the energy band offset. The thin TiO
x 
layer allows high optical transparency while majority carrier conduction is governed by the thermionic emission process over the low barrier height. Thus, common passivating materials, such as ultra-thin sub-stoichiometric SiO

, TiO

, and AlO
x 
are usually employed as dopa
