 because of the introduction of doping-related defects that will result in considerable bulk resistivity losses [19]. Additionally, the thermal budget required for dopant activation and diffusion is high, which has therefore persuaded photovoltaics research into the direction of dopant-free CSC development for n-Si solar cells. The selection and extraction of free charge carriers can be managed without the doping approach since the same mechanism can be accomplished by using the energy band offs
