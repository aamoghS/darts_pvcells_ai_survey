over, with a TMO having a high WF and excellent optical transparency such as MoO
x
, superior hole-selectivity in tandem with a-Si:H(i) passivation of the front surface is predicted to achieve a 21.8-% efficiency [120]. Further, the MoO

layer thickness dictates the lateral conductivity to the contacts. Effective field-effect and chemical passivation schemes have been demonstrated using PECVD-grown AlO

dielectric stacks to passivate heavily doped p-Si emitters [122,123], thus enablin
