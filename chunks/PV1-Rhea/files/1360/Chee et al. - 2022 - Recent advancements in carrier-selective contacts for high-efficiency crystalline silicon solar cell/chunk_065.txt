 for efficiency enhancement in all SHJ technologies, two major drawbacks have been identified that need to be addressed for front contact-related opto-electrical loss mitigation: 1) the relatively small bandgap of doped a-Si:H leads to greater parasitic absorption losses, and the 2) toxic material/doping sources which can sometimes be costly. Thus, the motivation arises to employ relatively cheap dopant-free CSCs having superior optical transparency on both sides of the c-Si wafer. As an example
