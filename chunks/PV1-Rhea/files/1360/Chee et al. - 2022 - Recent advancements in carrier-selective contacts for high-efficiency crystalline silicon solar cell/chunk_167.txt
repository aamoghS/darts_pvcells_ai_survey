passivated-rear surface [22]. Bulk (p-type c-Si) and surface (doped front emitter) recombination losses are key constraints, however, to the efficiency performance. New initiatives to reduce the parasitic absorption losses in the poly-Si were recently reported through various parameter investigations in the deposition and processing of the SiO
