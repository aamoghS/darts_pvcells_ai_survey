 In ions and oxygen vacancies induce highly asymmetric conductivity that favors holes and reduces recombination losses due to defects at the c-Si surface. In fact, defect-assisted quantum tunneling of the holes may occur due to the fixed charges in the a-SiO
x
(In) IL [151]. The excellent charge transport property provided by the resulting a-SiO
x
(In)/TCO stack, therefore, leads to a significantly reduced

c
, thereby increasing both FF and effi

ciency even without a MoO

IL. However, the
