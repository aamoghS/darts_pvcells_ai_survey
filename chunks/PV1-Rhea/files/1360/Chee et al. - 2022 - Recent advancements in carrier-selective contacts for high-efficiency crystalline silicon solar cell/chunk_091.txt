have not broken through the 20-% efficiency mark so far (i.e., for cells without the a-Si:H membrane). Nevertheless, the TiO

-based film, i.e., with a tunnel-SiO

layer inserted between the c-Si and dopant-free contact layer to improve surface passivation, stably withstands industry-standard quick firing conditions so that with further optimization, the adoption of full-area TiO

-based ECL allowed more than 22-% efficiency within the following year (see Fig. 4) [41]. For
