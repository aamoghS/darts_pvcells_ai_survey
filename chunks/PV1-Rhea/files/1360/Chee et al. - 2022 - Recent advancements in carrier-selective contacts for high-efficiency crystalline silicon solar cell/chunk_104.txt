 in SHJ solar cells. For even higher optical transparency up to 99.9% and lower sheet resistance below 5/sq., high-performing TCOs have been introduced recently through optimizations of the physical properties such as structural geometries and mass densities [93,94]. Numerical analysis revealed that TCOs having WF >5eV are preferable for state-of-the-art SHJ device design, i.e., allowing for thinner and lightly doped a-Si:H films [95]. Thus, advanced contact-related designs could reduce the opt
