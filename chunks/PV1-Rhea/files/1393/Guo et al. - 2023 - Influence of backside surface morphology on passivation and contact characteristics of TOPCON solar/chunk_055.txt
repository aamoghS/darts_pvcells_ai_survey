mids (alkaline polishing) may result in a more uniform SiOx layer and thus improved surface passivation. For high-quality silicon, when the impurity concentration exceeds 1E18cm
ï¿½3 
and the surface passivation has been done well enough, Auger recombination will become the main recombination mechanism at high injection levels. The doping concentration of the material will significantly
