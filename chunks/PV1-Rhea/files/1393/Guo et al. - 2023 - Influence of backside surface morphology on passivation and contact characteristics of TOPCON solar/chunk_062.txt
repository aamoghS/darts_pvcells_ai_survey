ly reasons are that the flat surface allows for thicker film thickness and better densification, and the lower actual annealing temperature due to high reflectivity results in less metal burn-through. More importantly, surface planarization seriously affects the formation of silver crystallites. Although the acid-polished samples retained the rounded pyramids, J
