mation of silver crystallites [4,18,34]. On the other hand, the rough surface is easier to realize the direct transport of carriers. Silver crystallites transport carriers in four ways, among which direct transport between silver crystallites and metal grid lines (without glass layer in between) is very important to achieve low contact resistance [14,15]. This transfer is easier to achieve on the tips of pyramidal surfaces and similar rough surfaces that are not easily covered by layers of glass
