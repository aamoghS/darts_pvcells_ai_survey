formed simultaneously. This requires that a good surface topography must be achieved based on the complete removal of the edge and backside B-diffusion PN junctions to achieve high parallel resistance, superior passivation characteristics, and Good contact characteristics with metal. Under the condition that the weight reduction meets the
