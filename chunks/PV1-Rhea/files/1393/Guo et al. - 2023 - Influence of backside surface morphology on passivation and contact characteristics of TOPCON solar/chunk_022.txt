 polishing. The additives used in this paper were all prepared by our laboratory. Through formula optimization and improvement, texturing additives can obtain uniform pyramid size and low reflectivity, and polishing additives can obtain good polishing properties and oxide layer protection. Then, an ultra-thin tunnel oxide layer is grown using thermal oxidation, followed by the deposition of an intrinsic polysilicon layer by LPCVD [52]. Low-pressure phosphorous diffusion doping was per
