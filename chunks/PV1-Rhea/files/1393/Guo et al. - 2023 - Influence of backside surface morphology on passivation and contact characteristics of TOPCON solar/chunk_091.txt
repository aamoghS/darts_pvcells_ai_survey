ion and reduce its entry into the heavily doped polysilicon to be recombined. A flatter surface will also cause a significant increase in the contact resistance on the backside of the solar cell, which will manifest as a huge difference in FF. Compared to the alkali-textured and alkali-polished samples, the acid-polished samples eliminated pyramidal spikes to achieve better passivation characteristics, while the roughened surface achieved better metal contact. Therefore, the contradiction betwee
