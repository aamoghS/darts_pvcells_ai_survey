ilms deposited by PECVD due to planarized surfaces may also result in a reduction in the number of silver crystallites incorporated into the silicon. At the same time, the increased reflectivity of the polished topography slightly reduces the actual temperature during the high-temperature fast co- firing process, which may affect the formation of deep silver crystallites. Therefore, we believe that when metal firing is performed on the TOPCon structure, it is inevitable that the oxide layer is b
