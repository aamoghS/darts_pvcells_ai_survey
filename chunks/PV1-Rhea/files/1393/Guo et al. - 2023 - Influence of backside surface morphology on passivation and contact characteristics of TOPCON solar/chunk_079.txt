 other process preparation processes. This shows that in terms of the passivation characteristics of solar cell precursors before printing metal contact, alkali polishing is better than acid etching and alkali texturing. From the electrical properties of the battery shown in Table 2, due to poor metal contact, alkali polishing has a large series resistance and a very low fill factor (80.86%), even if its opening voltage (710 mV) and current (41.32 mA/cm2) are improved, but the final battery effi
