trate resistivity, as outlined in Table 2. Advances in technology have ushered in cost-effective Ga-doped substrates devoid of the BO defect. It may be reasonably assumed that Ga-doped substrates boast identical bulk lifetimes to their B-doped counterparts, post-permanent BO deactivation. Higher substrate lifetimes facilitate superior performance at BOL conditions. Concurrently, intrinsic recombination losses diminish as substrate resistivity decreases, leading to higher efficiencies. However, i
