ar cells as the principal power source. This has re-opened the discussion on the relative merits at cell and array level of an inexpensive, low-efficiency technology over a more expensive, higher-efficiency technology [5]. Silicon solar cells, especially p-type silicon cells, have been extensively used in space missions for several decades and have a proven track record of success [6]. The current mainstream industrial crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell technology is the Passivated Emitter an
