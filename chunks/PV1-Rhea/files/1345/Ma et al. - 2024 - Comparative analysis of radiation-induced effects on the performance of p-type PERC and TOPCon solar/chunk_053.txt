n solar cells since the Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) for silicon is well known, allowing the full radiation response of a solar cell to be determined for both protons and electrons to be made from measurements of one proton energy and two electron energies [27]. Assumptions regarding uniform defects triggered by 1 MeV electrons, and the identification of five such defects has been derived from DLTS measurements [21]. Building upon the simulation methodology applied to the PERC and n-TOPCon ar
