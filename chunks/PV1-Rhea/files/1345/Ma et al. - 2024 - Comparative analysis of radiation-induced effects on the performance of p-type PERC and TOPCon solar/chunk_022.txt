-type substrates emerged as a viable strategy to circumvent BO defects [15]. In the absence of BO defects, the maximum achievable lifetimes were found to be mainly dependent on the sub
-
strate’s doping concentration [16]. Under the circumstance where the excess carrier density (n) equals 10 % of the hole concentration (p
0
), the bulk lifetime (
