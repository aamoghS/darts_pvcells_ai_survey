n both the PERC and TOPCon solar cell structures. In the domain of optical simulations, the methodology involved the establishment of three-dimensional (3D) unit cells, characterized by a regular upright pyramid texture, within the simulation environment. Light trapping strategies were assessed through the implementation of the raytracing technique, encompassing considerations of both front antireflection coating (ARC) effects and rear diffuse reflection. The settings for the front ARC and rear
