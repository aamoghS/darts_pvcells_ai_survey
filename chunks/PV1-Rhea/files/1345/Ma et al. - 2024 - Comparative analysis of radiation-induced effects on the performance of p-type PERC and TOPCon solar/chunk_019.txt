ng Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination [12] were meticulously calibrated to replicate the measured characteristics of commercially available PERC and TOPCon cells under standard test conditions. Given the level of front and rear passivation for current solar cell architectures, the efficiency potential for p-type solar cells is commonly constrained by the bulk minority carrier lifetime. This is particularly relevant for boron-doped substrates, where the interplay of boron and oxygen concentra
