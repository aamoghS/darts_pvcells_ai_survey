iginally developed for the fabrication of industrial grade TOPCon solar cells based on monocrystalline CZ Si wafers [118,120]. According to the report, significant power loss of almost 4% may be occurred due to the bulk recombination losses in quasi-mono Si wafers and hence enhancement in the power conversion efficiency may be
