atic diagram of a TOPCon solar cell is depicted in Fig. 3 which features tunnel oxide passivated rear contact and a diffused boron-doped p
+
emitter. To reduce the front side surface recombination, boron-doped p
+
emitter was passivated by a stack of atomic layer deposited (ALD) aluminium oxide (Al

) layer and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) silicon nitride (SiN
x
) layer. Besides, it has been well established that silicon nitride (SiN
