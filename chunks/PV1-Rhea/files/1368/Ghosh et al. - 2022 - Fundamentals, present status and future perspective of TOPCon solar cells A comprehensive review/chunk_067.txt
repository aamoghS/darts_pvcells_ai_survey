ickness value of ALD coated ultra-thin SiO
x 
layer was 1.1 Â±0.1 nm, irrespective of nature and orientation of the bulk Si surfaces. However, a gain in V
oc 
of almost 10 mV was realized when polished <100>oriented Si wafers were used for the development of double-sided TOPCon solar cells. This gain may be attributed to the presence of lower number of defect states at bulk c-Si/SiO
x 
interface. On the other hand, TOPCon structure based on <111>oriented polished Si wafers demonstrated a very lo
