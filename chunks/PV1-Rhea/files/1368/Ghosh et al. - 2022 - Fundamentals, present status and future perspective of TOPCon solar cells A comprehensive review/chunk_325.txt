er hand, silicon based tandem solar cells with its expected average stabilized efficiency of 28% in cell level and 26% in module level within 2031 may become one of the key players in SPV industry in the long-term future. However, the mass production of Si-based tandem solar cells has not been started yet; expected to be initiated from 2023. Therefore, it has to pass through various stages such as simplification of the processing steps, enhancing the throughput and cost-effectiveness before repl
