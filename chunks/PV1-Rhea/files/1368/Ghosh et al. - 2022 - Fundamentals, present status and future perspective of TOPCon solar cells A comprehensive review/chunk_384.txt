m this, the impact of using alternative metal (like Cu) on the contact properties may be investigated. Even, use of multilayer metallic contact such as Ag/Cu, Ag/Al etc. needs to promoted, subjected to the fulfillment of required contact properties for efficient carrier collection. B. Development and light management of thin TOPCon solar cells Undoubtedly, development of crystalline silicon solar cells based on thin wafers is a promising approach due to featuring various advantages such as low b
