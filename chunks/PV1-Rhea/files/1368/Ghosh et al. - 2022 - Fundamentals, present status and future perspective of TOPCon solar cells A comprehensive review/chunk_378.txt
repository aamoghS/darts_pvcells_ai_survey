ng the recombination current density at metal/semiconductor interface; specifically at the front side of the solar cells where TOPCon structure is generally not present due to its own demerits like parasitic absorption will take place. Therefore, the reduction of front sided recombination current density may be obtained by optimizing the metalized area fraction by means of optimizing the finger width [20]. The other way thorough which we can reduce the recombination current density at the front
