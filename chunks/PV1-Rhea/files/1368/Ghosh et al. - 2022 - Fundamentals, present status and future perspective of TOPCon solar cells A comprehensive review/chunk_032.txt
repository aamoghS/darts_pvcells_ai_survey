a phosphorous-doped poly silicon layer at metal-semiconductor interface may significantly reduce the surface recombination at the rear side of n-type crystalline silicon solar cells. The thickness of chemically grown silicon dioxide layer was kept as low as 1.4 nm so that current can tunnel through it easily and efficiently. Onto this ultra-thin oxide layer, a 20 nm phosphorous doped amorphous silicon layer was deposited by PECVD technique, followed by a high
