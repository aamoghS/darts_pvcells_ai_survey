C. As a result, Auger recombination (J
0,Auger
) rate got increased within the diffused c-Si region near the c-Si/SiO
x 
interface. Besides, increment of surface recombination velocity (S
eff
) at c-Si/SiO
x 
interface was also noticed which was also a strong reason for the decrement of the value of iV

at higher annealing temperature. On th
