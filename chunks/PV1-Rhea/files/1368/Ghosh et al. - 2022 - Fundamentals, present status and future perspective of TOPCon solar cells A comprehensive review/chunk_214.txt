assivation properties was also investigated. Excellent surface passivation quality with an implied open-circuit voltage (iV

C and 60 min, respectively. Such high temperature treatment with increasing the annealing time from 10 min to 60 min helped to raise the poly-Si grain size from 13 nm to 40 nm which in turn provided high value of iV
