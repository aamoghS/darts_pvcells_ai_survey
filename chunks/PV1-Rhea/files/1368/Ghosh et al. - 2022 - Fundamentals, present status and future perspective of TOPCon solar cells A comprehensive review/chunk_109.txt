used) compared to the oxide layer grown by either chemical oxidation or plasma oxidation method [40]. The supremacy of thermally grown ultra-thin SiO
x 
tunnelling layer in terms of iV
oc 
and minority carrier lifetime (

) may be attributed to the lesser number of Si/SiO
x 
interfacial defect states. In addition, XPS results also confirmed that thermally grown SiO
x 
layer featured the most number of Si
4+
oxidation states than the oxide layer developed by other methods. Apart from the above m
