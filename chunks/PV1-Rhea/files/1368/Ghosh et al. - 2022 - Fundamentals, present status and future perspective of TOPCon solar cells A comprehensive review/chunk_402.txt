ciency solar cells due to their excellent surface passivation quality and efficient carrier extraction capability [146]. These carrier selective contact layers may also be used as an alternative of doped poly-Si layer in TOPCon structure, followed by a comparative study in the device level. Besides, improvement in the blue response in both-s
