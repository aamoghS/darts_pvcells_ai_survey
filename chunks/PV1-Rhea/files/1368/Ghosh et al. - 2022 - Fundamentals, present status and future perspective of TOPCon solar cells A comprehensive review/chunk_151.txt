tion of charge carriers occurs due to the tunneling process only, then the J-V characteristic will be non-linear, (ii) increment in both forward current and reverse saturation current will be observed if pinholes contribute only a small amount of transportation of charge carriers, (iii) J-V curve will show linearity or Ohmic behavior when a certain amount of charge carriers flow through the pinholes. These findings converged well with the observations made by Guo et al. [39]. Also, the simulatio
