ness. Actually, the reduction of oxide layer thickness resulted in increasing the number of carrier transport channels i.e. the number of pinholes which in turn maximized the electric field through the ultra-thin SiO

layer. Consequently, the highest electric field was ob

layer was kept as 0.2 nm. This enhancement in the electric field in the tunnel oxide layer resulted in maximizing the efficiency potential of TOPCon solar cells up to 29.0
