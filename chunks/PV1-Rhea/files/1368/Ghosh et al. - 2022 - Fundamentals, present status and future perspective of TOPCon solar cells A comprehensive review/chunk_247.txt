 to presence of doped poly-Si layer at the front side. Therefore, as mentioned in the earlier section, recombination current density at the front emitter/metal interface was reduced by some other means such as implementation of selective emitter underneath the front metal contact [15,21,25,96,97]. According to Feldmann et al., use of selective emitter in n-type TOPCon solar cells resulted in reduction of the front side recombination current density by a considerable margin [96]. As a result, sig
