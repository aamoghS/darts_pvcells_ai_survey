layer was studied thoroughly by Yang et al. and it was observed that the pinhole density did not change much for prolonged thermal treatment of 180 min in compared to 30 min thermal annealing even at different annealing temperature [58]. For example, the magnitude of pinhole density at an annealing temperature of 820
