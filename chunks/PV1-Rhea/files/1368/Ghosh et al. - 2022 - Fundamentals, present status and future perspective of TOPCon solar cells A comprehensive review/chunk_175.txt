Additionally, the study further revealed that better result was obtained when the low frequency PECVD coated doped poly-Si layer was combined with thermally grown ultra-thin interfacial tunnel oxide layer instead of combining with chemically grown oxide layer. On the other hand, Polzin et al. also ob
