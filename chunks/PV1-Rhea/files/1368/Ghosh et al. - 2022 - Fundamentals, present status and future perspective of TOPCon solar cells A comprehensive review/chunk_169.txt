plantation technique was used for the conversion of low pressure chemical vapor deposited (LPCVD) intrinsic a-Si layer into doped poly-Si layer for the formation of TOPCon structure [63]. In the contribution, the influential effect on the surface passivation properties of the ion implanted passivated contacts due to the variation of doping species, ion dose, and poly-Si thickness was investigated to facilitate the fabrication of both-sided contact solar cells with higher power conversion efficie
