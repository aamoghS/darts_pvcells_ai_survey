was observed. However, a decrement in the cell performance was noticed when the thickness of tunnelling SiO
2 
layer was increased beyond 0.2 nm. Reduced carrier transport through thicker SiO
2 
layer may be the reason for this phenomenon. 12.Future scope of work with possible challenges So far we have observed how the intensified study has been con
