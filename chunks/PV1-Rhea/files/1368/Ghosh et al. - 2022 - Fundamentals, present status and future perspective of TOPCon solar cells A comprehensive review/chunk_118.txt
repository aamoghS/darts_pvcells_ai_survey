tunneling layers. TEM and angle-resolved XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) were found to be the most suitable method for the measurement of the thickness of the ultra-thin 1.0–1.5 nm SiO
x 
layers with an accuracy of 0.35 nm. On the other hand, an overestimation of the actual thickness was observed by using ToF-SIMS (Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion
