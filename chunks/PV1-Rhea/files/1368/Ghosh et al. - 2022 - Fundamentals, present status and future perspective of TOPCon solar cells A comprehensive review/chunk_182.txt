of 712 mV for hydrogenated n-type passivated contacts in which the doped silicon layer was prepared by APCVD technique [68]. Physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques such as sputtering were used for the development of doped silicon layer [69,70]. Yan et al. in their study developed in-situ boron doped silicon films to realize hole-selective passivated contacts by using a single co-sputtering system whi
