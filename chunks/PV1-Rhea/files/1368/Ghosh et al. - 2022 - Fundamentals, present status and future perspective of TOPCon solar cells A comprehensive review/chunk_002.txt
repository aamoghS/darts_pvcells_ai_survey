cells, interdigitated back contact solar cells, heterojunction with interdigitated back contact solar cells and tunnel oxide passivated contact solar cells. Out of these various high efficiency solar cells, tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells are gaining more interests due to possessing various advantages such as availability of raw material, easy process sequence, high efficiency potential etc. In this review article, we shall discuss the evolutionary development of this high e
