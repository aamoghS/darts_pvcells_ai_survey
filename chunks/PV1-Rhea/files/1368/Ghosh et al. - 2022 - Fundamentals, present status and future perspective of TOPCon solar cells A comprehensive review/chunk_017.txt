the solar photovoltaics market is being exclusively dominated by cell concepts with diffused and passivated p-n junctions and passivated rear sides (PERC/PERL/PERT/ TOPCON) [19]. The report has also predicted that BSF will be produced mostly on cost-efficient mc-Si wafers and will probably disappear after 2025. Most interestingly, the market share of PERC/PERL/PERT/TOP
