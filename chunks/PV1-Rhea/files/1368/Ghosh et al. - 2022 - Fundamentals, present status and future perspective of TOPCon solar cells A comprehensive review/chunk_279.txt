o fabricate both sides contacted solar cells featuring TOPCon structure at the back with a power conversion efficiency of beyond 26%. On the other hand, numerical simulation tool Quokka 2 was used to evaluate the influential effect of p-type and n-type passivated contact on the efficiency potential of the industrial standard p-type Si solar cells [109]. Especially, a focus on the role of the front-structure design, the wafer resistivity and bulk lifetime, the carrier selectivity and the contact
