[110]. According to the report, a total J
sc 
loss of about 5 mA/cm

was realized due to the occurrence of various types of optical losses as mentioned here: (i) infrared parasitic absorption losses occurred in bulk and rear side of the cell (corresponding J
sc 
loss =1.8 mA/cm

), (ii) infrared escape reflection losses (corresponding J
sc 
loss =1.4 mA/cm

), (iii) front grid shading losses (corresponding J
sc 
loss =1.2 mA/cm

), (iv) parasitic absorption of the incident light at
