hiometry of the tunnelling layer. On the other hand, the stoichiometry of the ultra-thin oxide layer is dependent on the fabrication process and post deposition thermal treatment. A study to control the oxide stoichiometry by optimizing the post deposition annealing conditions was carried out by Kim et al. [44]. Blistering of thin films on flat Si substrate surfaces was observed at the time of thermal treatment of doped a-Si:H layers. This phenomenon may be caused by the effusion of hydrogen fro
