r. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that TOPCon solar cell has a good optical performance. And reducing the optical loss is crucial for im-proving the efficiency of SHJ cell.4   |   DiscussionWe have discussed the differences in optics, contact, and pas-sivation performance among the three types of solar cells. We can now compare the carrier selectivity (S10), according to the calculation, which assumes the non- contacted area with perfectly passivated (i.e., J0 = 0) on the hole- sel
