(i)/a- Si:H contacts offer a lower S10,e&h,max value of 13.2 and the lower efficiency potential of 27.5% than the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H layers [31].Though we calculated the optimum actual fraction of cells with the above n- type Si wafer and the hole contact, as well as the electron contact, the maximum efficiency ηb,e,h,max of PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ solar cells were 26.8%, 27.98%, and 28.12%, respectively. The maximum efficiency with metal shading (ηb,e,h,m,max) were calculated by using Equation
