two key factors limiting the efficiency of TOPCon cells. One is the loss caused by boron heavy doping, which en-hances the saturation current density J0 in the passivated contact region [52], and the other is recombination at the p+ layer metal contacts, which are a current challenge for PV manufacturing.SHJ cell technology, the second important n- type passivation contact, which is a structure with a monocrystalline silicon wafer sandwiched between nanometer- thick n- type (p- type) doped hydro
