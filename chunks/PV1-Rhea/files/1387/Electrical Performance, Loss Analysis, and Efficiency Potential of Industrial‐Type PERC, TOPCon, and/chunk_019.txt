discovery of TOPCon was Feldman and Fraunhofer, who reported in 2013 that TOPCon had replaced BSF, with VOC elevated to 698 mV [37]. Since then, polysilicon/silicon oxide contacts have been reintro-duced into the field of solar cells. TOPCon structure is achieved by introducing tunneling barriers (such as ultrathin dielectric layers) into selective contact structures, resulting in asymmet-ric tunneling probabilities of electrons and holes (such as due to changes in barrier height or effectiv
