 the worst optical performance owing to the parasitic absorption of a- Si:H layer and high contact resistivity, the value of ηb,e,h,m,max is 0.7% lower than that of TOPCon solar cells. PERC structure has superior optical performance than SHJ structure, but due to poor passivation performance, the ηb,e,h,m,max is only 26.42%. The next- generation products may be heterojunction back- contact (HBC) and TOPCon back- contact (TBC) cells with high ηb,e,h,m,max of 28.12% and 27.99%, respectively. Ex
