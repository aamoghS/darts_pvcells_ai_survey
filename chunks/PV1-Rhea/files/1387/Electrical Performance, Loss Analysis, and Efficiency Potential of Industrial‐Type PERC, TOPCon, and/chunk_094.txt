(ηb,e,h,m,max) were calculated by using Equation(10), as shown in Table7.where Jsc is about 43.6 mA/cm2, A denotes the current loss value ratio of approximately 0.44 mA/cm2/% under 1% contacting area on the front surface of solar cell according to Griddler simula-tion calculations, and ffront represents the contacting area frac-tion on the front side of solar cell.Using Equation(10), the ηb,e,h,m,max of PERC solar cell had gone down to 26.42%. Similarly, the ηb,e,h,m,max of TOPCon cell was
