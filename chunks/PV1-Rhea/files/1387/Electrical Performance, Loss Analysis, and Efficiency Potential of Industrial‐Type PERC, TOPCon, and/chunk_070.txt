 mV of TOPCon cell, it is in-dicated that the metallization- induced recombination caused a decrease in Voc of up to 8 mV, especially in the p+ region. But its Voc value was higher than the simulated one, perhaps owing to un- considering the improvement bulk lifetime of wafer through the high- temperature process [55]. The PERC cell has the lowest Voc value of 696 mV, which has a high de-crease in Voc of up to 20 mV owing to the metallization- induced recombination, which caused the direct conta
