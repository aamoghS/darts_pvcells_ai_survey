 can pro-vide a good conductivity, and then the intensity of paste ero-sion on its layer can be controlled. From the above analysis, we should balance the good conductivity and low corrosive-ness of the paste on the metal area as one of the challenging and critical tasks in the PV market.3.2   |   The Specific Contact Resistance (ρc)The plot of ρc values for different layers is shown in Figure4. The n+ layers, such as P- doped n++ emitter and SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer, have low ρc values with
