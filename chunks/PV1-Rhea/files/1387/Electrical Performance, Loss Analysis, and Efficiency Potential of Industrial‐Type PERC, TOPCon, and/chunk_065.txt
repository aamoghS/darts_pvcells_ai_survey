reduced by 64% and 87%, respectively, which is mainly attributed to using the passivation contact layer such as SiOx/n+- poly- Si, a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+), and a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layers. At pres-ent, the main task of TOPCon solar cell is how to reduce the J0 loss of p+ layer, and the possible direction is aimed for the SiOx/p+- poly- Si layer to replace B- doped layer as the emitter. However, SHJ solar cell has almost perfect surface passivation performance.3.4   |   Cell PerformanceThe resul
