 Equations(1)(3), respectively. The saturation current density of the bulk mate-rial (Jo,bulk) was estimated to be 5 fA/cm2 for n- type wafer and 20 fA/cm2 for p- type wafer. The Voc and FF values of the cells were calculated from Jo,total and ρc using an ideal one- diode model, and the results are shown in Table2. The SHJ solar cell had the highest Voc of approximately 749 mV, thus obtaining a gain of over 20 and 50 mV compared to TOPCon and PERC cells, respectively, mainly owing to the Jo
