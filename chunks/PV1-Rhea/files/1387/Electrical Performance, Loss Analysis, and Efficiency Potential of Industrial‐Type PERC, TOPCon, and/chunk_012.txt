ohmic contacts from the design of diffuse emitters in the passivation region [19Â–22]. These regions function as membranes that block minority carriers and conduct majority carriers [23] and thereby define the direction of current flow and make the solar cell work. Heavy doping (n++) forms a local electric field on the surface silicon, sweeping holes back into the c- Si and accelerating electron conduction to the electrode [24]. Subsequently, more lightly doped emitters and screen- printed sil-v
