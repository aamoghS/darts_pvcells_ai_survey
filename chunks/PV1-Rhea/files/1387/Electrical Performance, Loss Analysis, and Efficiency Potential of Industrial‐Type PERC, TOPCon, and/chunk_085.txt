mong them, the ηmax(S10) is assuming a 2 Ω·cm n- type c- Si wafer with thickness of 110 µm with Lambertian light trap-ping (Jsc = 43.6 mA/cm2) and intrinsic bulk recombination with a single contact of selectivity S10 [74]. Because of low Jo and ρc values for the electron- selective layers, it cannot find any significant differences in the ηe,max, which is compatible with [31]. However, for the hole- selective layers, the S10,h of Al- BSF layer has the lowest value of ~13.3, and the corres
