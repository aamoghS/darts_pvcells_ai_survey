e at the excess carrier density of 1 × 1015 cm3, and the order of median ef-fective lifetime is the precursor structure of SHJ (2797 µs), TOPCon (1265 µs), and PERC cell (225 µs).The IV parameters of PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ cells are shown in Table3. SHJ has a high Voc of 748 mV, which is the same as the precursor iVoc and the simulated values, which indicated that the metallization- induced recombination can be ignored. Followed by Voc 728 mV of TOPCon cell, it is in-dicated that the meta
