in why SHJ cell has a high Voc, whereas the P- doped n++ and n+ layers with the sheet resistances of 135 and 230 Ω/sq correspondingly have the highest J0 val-ues of about 18 and 60 fA/cm2, respectively, which is consistent with the lowest Voc of PERC solar cell. However, owing to AlOx/SiNx passivation, the B- doped p++ and p+ layers (R,p++ = 75 Ω/sq, R,p+ = 230 Ω/sq) correspondingly have the lower J0 values of about 8 and 25 fA/cm2, respectively, than P doping layers. The J0 values of th
