in Figure8. The ef-ficiency of Î·b,e,h,m,max was in the order of HBC (28.12%) > TBC (27.99%) > HPBC (26.96%). From the above analysis, we con-clude that by exploiting its high potential with large- scale pro-duction, a close to perfect passivation of the non- contact area, the wide process window, and low cost are required. And it will be the next major challenge for transferring these new concepts to industrial solar cell production.5   |   ConclusionsWe have studied the passivation performanc
