consists of a SiOx (1.4 ± 0.2 nm) layer and an intrinsic a- Si (100 ± 20 nm) layer, was formed by low- pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and then annealed in a tube furnace at 880°C for 45 min using a mixture gas of POCl3, O2, and N2 to form n+- poly- Si layer. After removing BSG/PSG [71], the front and rear passivation of the cells were achieved by 35- nm- thick AlOx by ALD and 80- nm- thick SiNx dielectric stacks by PECVD. The metallization was achieved by screen printing and fir
