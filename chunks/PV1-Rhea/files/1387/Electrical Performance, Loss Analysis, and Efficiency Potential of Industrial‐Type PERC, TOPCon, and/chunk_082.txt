on doping layer is inferior to that of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer, it is consistent with the result of J0. The PERC solar cell also has three primary ad-vantages compared to SHJ solar cell: blue loss, ARC reflec-tance loss, and NIR parasitic absorption loss. Compared to SHJ/TOPCon solar cell, the chief disadvantage of PERC solar cell is base collection loss, which is mainly attributed to the bulk lifetime of p- type silicon wafer. From the above analysis, it can be concluded th
