fficiency potential of industrial- type PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ solar cells were studied and compared. The results showed that TOPCon structure with a high passivation performance and good optical performance is more suitable for bifacial solar cell and the high-est theoretical limiting efficiency with metal shading on the n- type Si wafer (Î·b,e,h,m,max) can be achieved to 27.62%. Although SHJ structure with the highest passivation performance but the worst optical performance owing to the parasi
