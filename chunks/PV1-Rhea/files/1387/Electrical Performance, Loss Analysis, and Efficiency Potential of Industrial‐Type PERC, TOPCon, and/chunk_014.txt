ped to reduce the optical and resistive losses in the front grid lines [2528], which can significantly improve the effi-ciency of PERC cells.In 2019, LONGi reported efficiencies of 23.83% and 24.06% [29] for champion PERC cells. In 2022, Trina announced that the high- efficiency PERC solar cell with size of 210 × 210 mm has an efficiency of 24.5%, which is also the highest efficiency re-cord of the PERC structure so far [30]. This efficiency reached 24.5% of the PERC theoretical performance e
