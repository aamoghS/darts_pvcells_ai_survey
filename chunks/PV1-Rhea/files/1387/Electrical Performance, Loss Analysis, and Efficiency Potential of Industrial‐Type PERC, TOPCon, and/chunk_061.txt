d PERC cells, respectively, mainly owing to the Jo,total reduction of 10 and 50 fA/cm2, respectively. The TOPCon cell had a low ρc, resulting in a high FF of about 82.2%, followed by SHJ 81.5% without considering the contribution of Voc to FF. Although the n++ layer on PERC cell had a low ρc, we could not obtain a high FF, mainly because of the high ρc of the p+ layer.The J0 loss was used to be discussed in order to understand the effects of passivation performance on the three types of solar
