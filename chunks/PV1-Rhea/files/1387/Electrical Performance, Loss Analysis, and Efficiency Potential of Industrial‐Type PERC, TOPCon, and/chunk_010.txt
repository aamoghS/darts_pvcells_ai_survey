impurity concentrations and crystal defects greatly suppress the loss of substrate composite materials and provide a prerequisite for manufacturing high- efficiency solar cells. The development and implementation of processes to mitigate boronoxygen (BO)- related light- induced degradation (LID) as well as photothermal attenuation (LeTID) [79] in Ga- doped p- type direct- drawn silicon (Cz) growth [10, 11] have improved the long- term stability of PERC solar cells. In addition, improvement
