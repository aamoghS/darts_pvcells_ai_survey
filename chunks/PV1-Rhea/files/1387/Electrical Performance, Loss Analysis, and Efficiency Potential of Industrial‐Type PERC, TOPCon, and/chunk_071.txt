duced recombination, which caused the direct contact between the silicon substrate and the metal paste. The order of Jsc value is TOPCon > PERC > SHJ, it is attributed to the parasitic absorp-tion and surface passivation of the film layer. And the order of FF value is SHJ > TOPCon>PERC, which is attributed to the contact resistance and lateral resistance. From the above analysis, the efficiency performance of the cell is in the order of TOPCon > SHJ > PERC.An analysis of the three types of solar
