µm (DR laser). The metallization was achieved by screen printing and firing of a metal paste using an H- patterned grid design on both sides of the wafers. A good contact is then formed using a firing temperature of 820Â°C.The fabrication sequence of TOPCon cell is shown in Table1. The n- type monocrystalline silicon wafers with a resistivity of 0.5Â–2.1 â„¦Â·cm were also textured in alkaline solution and sub-sequently cleansed in an HCl/HF mixed solution. The front boron (B) SE (R,p++ = 75 â„
