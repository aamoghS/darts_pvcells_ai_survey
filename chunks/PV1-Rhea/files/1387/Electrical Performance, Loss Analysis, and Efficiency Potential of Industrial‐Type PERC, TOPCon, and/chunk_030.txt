023 market share of about 9% to over 25% in the next decade. Based on these results, it took about 30 years to commercialize it. At present, some enterprises have carried out mass production of SHJ solar cells, and the mass production efficiency is about 25.0%Â–25.8% [40]. A trade- off of the cost and output power of SHJ solar cells is still an obstacle to its expanding market share. Being different from any previ-ous scalable c- Si PV generations, the SHJ cell features uniquely indispensable tr
