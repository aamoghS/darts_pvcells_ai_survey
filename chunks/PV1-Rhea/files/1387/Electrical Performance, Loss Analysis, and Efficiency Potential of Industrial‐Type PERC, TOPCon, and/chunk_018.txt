Ox/Si, and in 1983, they disclosed an 18% efficiency based on this structure, which was the first polycrystalline siliconbased solar cell [34]. However, in the following decades, the study of pas-sivation contact has not been widely concerned and applied. Regarding the notation, poly- Si emitters or semi- insulating poly- Si (SIPOS) emitters [35, 36] were used in the first reports of this contact scheme. What triggered the public rediscovery of TOPCon was Feldman and Fraunhofer
