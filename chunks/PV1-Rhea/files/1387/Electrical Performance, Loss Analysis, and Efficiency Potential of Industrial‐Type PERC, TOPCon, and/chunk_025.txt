een nanometer- thick n- type (p- type) doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a- Si:H) layers and passivation and base contacts deposited by low- temperature plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on Si bulk materials, was reported by Walther etal. at the University of Marburg in 1974 [53]. This type of carrier- selective contact is also known as heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) contact [54]. The p- type or n- type doping of a- Si:H causes band bending of the work f
