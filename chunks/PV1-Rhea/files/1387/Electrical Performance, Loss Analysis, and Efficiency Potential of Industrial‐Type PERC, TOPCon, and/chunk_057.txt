SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer, have low ρc values with less than 1 mΩ·cm2 owing to high solid solubility P in Si. However, a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer is covered by the low parasitic absorption of ITO, result-ing in low conductivity, and the high ρc is about 3 mΩ·cm2. The B- doped p++ layer with deep junction depth of over 0.6 µm has a low ρc value of about 0.7 mΩ·cm2, owing to deep cor-rosion of the Ag/Al paste [73]. And the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer has the lowest ρc of 0.3 mΩ·c
