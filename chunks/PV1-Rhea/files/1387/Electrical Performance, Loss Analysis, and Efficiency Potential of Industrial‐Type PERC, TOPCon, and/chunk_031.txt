s, the SHJ cell features uniquely indispensable transparent conducting oxide layers integrating a low- temperature annealing metal paste and high equipment investment. The unique electrode and equipment requirement is still the dominant factor to determine its rate of exposure mass manufacture technology [44].According to ITRPV's prediction [3], it appears that developing the passivating selective contact technology has become a hot topic for the next mass production of solar cells. Therefor
