ffi-ciency of the industry's mass- produced PERC solar cells is much lower than the champion efficiency. Most of the losses are re-combination at the metal contacts and the loss caused by two-  or three- dimensional current transport paths. Therefore, passiva-tion contact has been a hot research topic in the photovoltaics (PV) industry. Currently, the TOPCon structure consists of an ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) film and a n(+)- doped polysilicon (poly- Si) layer, which utilizes the concept of
