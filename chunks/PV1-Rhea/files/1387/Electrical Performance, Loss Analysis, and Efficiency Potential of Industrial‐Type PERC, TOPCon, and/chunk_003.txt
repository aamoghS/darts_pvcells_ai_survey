e getting closer to its theoretical efficiency limit. n- Type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cells with their superior passivating selective contacts technology were the most interesting photovoltaics (PV) technology in the industry. The effect of different passivated contact layers with respect to their influence on the J0, J0,metal, ρc, and the carrier selectivity (S10) and the loss analysis and efficiency potential of industrial- type PERC, TOPC
