were measured by WCT- 120 Sinton and extracted at the excess carrier density of 3 × 1015 cm3 [60] (Boulder, CO, USA). The ρc of the screen- printed metallized contact with different samples was determined by the transfer length method (TLM) (GP- 4 test). The optical reflectance of the cell was measured by PVE300- IVT. During these tests, the op-tical losses were analyzed by Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 (the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore) [72].3   |   Results3.1   |   T
