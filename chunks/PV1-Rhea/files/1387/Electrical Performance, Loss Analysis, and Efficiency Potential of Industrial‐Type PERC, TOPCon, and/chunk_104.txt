h caused the direct contact between the silicon substrate and the metal paste. From the above analysis, the disadvantage of PERC solar cell is base collection loss. The increasing FF and Jsc val-ues are the challenging and critical tasks in SHJ cell. And the p+ layer recombination is one of the critical tasks in TOPCon cell.Through the S10 simulation, the PERC solar cell limits the ef-ficiency to 26.42%, TOPCon 27.62%, and SHJ 26.91%. In the next- generation product BC structure, the order e
