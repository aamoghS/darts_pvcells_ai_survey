of PERC cell is shown in Table1. p- Type Cz- doped Ga monocrys-talline silicon wafers with the resistivity of 0.51.2 Ω·cm were textured in alkaline solution, followed by cleaning in HCl/HF mixed solution. The front P- selective emitters (R,n++ = 135 Ω/sq, R,n+ = 230 Ω/sq) were formed in a quartz tube furnace con-taining POCl3 gas (Sevenstar) and laser doping technology with the width of 90100 µm (DR laser, 532 nm, > 20 MKHz). After P diffusion, the rear side was polished by a mixe
