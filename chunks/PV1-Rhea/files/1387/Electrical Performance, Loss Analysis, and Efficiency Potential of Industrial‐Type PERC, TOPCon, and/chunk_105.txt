next- generation product BC structure, the order efficiency Î·b,e,h,m,max was followed in the order of HBC (28.12%) > TBC (27.99%) > HPBC (26.96%). From the perspective of limiting effi-ciency, TOPCon structure with high compatibility is suitable for bifacial BC solar cells, whereas SHJ structure with the parasitic absorption of a- Si:H layer and high contact resistivity is only suitable for BC solar cell. In conclusion, by exploiting its high po-tential with large- scale production, a close to
