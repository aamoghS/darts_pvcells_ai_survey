, owing to its high J0,e value of 109 fA/cm2 passivated by SiNx and a high contact resistance ρc of 0.26 Ω·cm2 containing resis-tance contributions from the lateral current flow in the emitter and from the c- Si/metal interface.And the current TOPCon solar cell with an efficiency of 25.87% features a B- diffused p++ hole- selective layer and a SiOx- n+- poly- Si electron- selective layer. The corresponding combined selectivity is S10,e&h,max = 14.87 and the limiting effi-ciency to 29.01%, ow
