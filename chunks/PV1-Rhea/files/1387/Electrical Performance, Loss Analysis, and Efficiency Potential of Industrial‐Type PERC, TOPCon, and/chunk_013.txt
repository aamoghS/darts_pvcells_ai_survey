e lightly doped emitters and screen- printed sil-ver pastes designed to form effective contacts with such emitters have been used in PERC cells, resulting in improved front surface passivation and spectral response without compromising con-tact resistance. In addition, the developments in screen printing techniques, such as knotless screen printing, dual printing, twice printing, multibusbar technology, and reduced finger widths, have been developed to reduce the optical and resistive losses in
