as the highest passivation performance with a high Voc of 748 mV due to a lowest J01 of about 14 fA/cm2, but worst optical performance owing to the parasitic absorption of a- Si:H layer. A 728 mV of TOPCon cell was obtained owing to the low J01 of SiOx- n+- poly- Si layer and good optical performance. The PERC cell has the lowest Voc of 696 mV, which has a high decrease in Voc of up to 20 mV owing to the metallization- induced recombination, which caused the direct contact between the silicon su
