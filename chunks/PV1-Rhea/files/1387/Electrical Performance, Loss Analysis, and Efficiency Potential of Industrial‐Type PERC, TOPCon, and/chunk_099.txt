clusionsWe have studied the passivation performance, electrical perfor-mance, and optical performance of the solar cells with differ-ent passivated contact layers. The main conclusions were made as follows: The passivated contact layers including a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+), a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+), SiOx/n+- poly- Si, and SiOx/n+- poly- Si layers have the low J0 < 6 fA/cm2, the low J0,metal < 100 fA/cm2, and the low ρc ≤ 3 mΩ.cm2, whereas the P- doped n++, the B- doped p++, and Al- BSF layer had
