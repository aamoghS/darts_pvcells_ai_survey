tive layer. The corresponding combined selectiv-ity is S10,e&h,max = 13.23 and the limiting efficiency to 27.5%. It is attributed to the industrially feasible path of SiO2/SiNx stacked layers to further enhance the potential of the n+ front emitter and to further decrease the saturation current density by 65 fA/cm and the ρc by 1.5 mΩ·cm2. These data are higher than that of [31], which stated that the S10 value of an n+ contact for PERC is 12, owing to its high J0,e value of 109 fA/cm2 passi
