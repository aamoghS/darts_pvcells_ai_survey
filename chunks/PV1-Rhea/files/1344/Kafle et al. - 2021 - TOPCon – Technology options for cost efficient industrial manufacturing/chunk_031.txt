 selectively formed on the front side by using a laser source, aiming to drive phosphorous atoms from the phosphorsilicate glass (PSG) layer into the silicon substrate. Such a selective-emitter approach is intended mainly to lower the recombination of minority charge carriers beneath the metal contacts. This is followed by the rear-emitter removal or chemical edge isolation (CEI) process, PSG etching and ozone-based cleaning [18] in the same wet-chemical inline tool. Ozone cleaning oxidizes the
