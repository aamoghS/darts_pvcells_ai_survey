 for the a-Si(n) reduce more with the deposition thickness as compared to the a-Si(i) layer. The cost advantage for thinner layers is, however, significantly higher for PECVD and APCVD deposited layers. For instance, the calculations show that COO reduction of almost 50% for PECVD and 65% for APCVD is achievable by lowering the a-Si layer thickness from 200 nm to 50 nm. The reduction of COO for PECVD a-Si is mainly due to a significant increase in throughput for lower thicknesses, which conseque
