tions of amorphous and crystalline phases. 3.1.LPCVD for a-Si deposition LPCVD is used as one of the important processes established in the semiconductor facilities to deposit highly conformal layers of a-Si/poly- Si layers at low-pressure conditions [15]. The main advantages of this technology are: a) good thickne
