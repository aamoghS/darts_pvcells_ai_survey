eposition technology, process routes that show the most promise towards mass production are identified based upon the technological and economic feasibility of the entailed process steps. The following are the primary selection criteria set for the best manufacturing scenario: a) availability of an industrial tool, b) process compatibility, c) availability of all process parameters required for the COO modeling, d) lean process flow, and e) successful demonstration of the process functionality.
