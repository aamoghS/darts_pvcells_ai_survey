iciencies over 26% [2,3]. Moreover, initial industrial adoption of this technology by PV manufacturers also shows promising results [4â€“7]. The envisioned industrial TOPCon process routes consist of the process steps that are either fully/partly transferable from the state-of- the-art PERC cell, with inclusion of few extra process steps that are necessary to increase the conversion efficiency. The technological maturity and the proven industrial readiness of process technologies used in PERC is
