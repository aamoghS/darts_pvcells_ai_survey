emitter. For PECVD TOPCon high & APCVD TOPCon high, BSG is kept intact during the wet-chemical step for rear- emitter removal in order to protect boron emitter against chemicals used in SSE process. After performing ozone cleaning in the same wet- chemical tool used for CEI/BSG processes, UV-TO is grown. After
