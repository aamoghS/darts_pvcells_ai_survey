formed either by wet-chemical or dry methods. Among wet-chemical methods, DI-O
3 
oxide is shown to have very good thermal stability [23]. Among dry methods, in-situ thermal oxide followed by the LPCVD a-Si deposition is the current mainstream process to form TOPCon layers in industry [25]. An appealing candidate is O
3
-based oxidation induced by dissociation of O
2 
by UV light sources [23]. This highly cost-effective method is able to form thermally stable stoichio
