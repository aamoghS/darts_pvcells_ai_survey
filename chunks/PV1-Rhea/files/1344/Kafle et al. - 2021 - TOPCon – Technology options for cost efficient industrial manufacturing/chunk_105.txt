osition rates in comparison to LPCVD. For instance, up to 50% reduction in COO can be achieved by lowering the thickness of PECVD and APCVD a-Si layer from 200 nm to 50 nm. For PECVD and APCVD a-Si technologies, two process routes are investigated based upon whether or not the single- sided polysilicon etching process is required in the envisioned TOPCon process sequence. For the techno-economic analysis, a TCO calculation for a green-field production with an annual production output of 5000 MWp
