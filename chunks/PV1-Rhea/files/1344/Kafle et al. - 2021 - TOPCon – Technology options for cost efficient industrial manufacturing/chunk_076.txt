n throughput for lower thicknesses, which consequently leads to a significant reduction of process consumable costs. For APCVD, lower COO for thinner layers are mainly due to lower process consumables’ costs as these costs occupy significant fraction of total COO. Although current screen-printing technology still requires thicker (150–200 nm) poly-Si layers to avoid shunting losses, advances in paste developments and better understanding of contact formation are expected to drive further red
