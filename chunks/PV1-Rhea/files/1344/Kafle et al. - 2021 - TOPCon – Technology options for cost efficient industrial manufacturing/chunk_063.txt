required to realize a TOPCon solar cell. Although LPCVD is currently the only industrialized process for a-Si deposition, there are several alternative technologies that are currently being tested and are in different stages of development. Besides, the tunnel oxide formation is also possible to realize using alternative oxidation methods, other than thermal oxidation that is used for LPCVD- based TOPCon process routes. In this section, different methods to form tunnel oxide and deposit a-Si lay
