tering in thick layers (d >100 nm), which are currently required for industrial TOPCon architecture due to an inherently high hydrogen concentration in the deposited a-Si layer. Although PECVD is loosely considered as a single sided deposition process, avoiding wrap-around of a-Si layers remains a technological milestone for
