oduction overhead costs and cost of capital at the factory level to estimate the TCO for the desired solar cell architecture. Different industrially feasible a-Si deposition technologies are identified and compared based upon equipment and process parameters, which are based on data provided by industrial equipment manufacturers as well as our own process parameters for industrial equipments within Fraunhofer ISEâ€™s PV-TEC pilot line. For each deposition technology, process routes that show the
