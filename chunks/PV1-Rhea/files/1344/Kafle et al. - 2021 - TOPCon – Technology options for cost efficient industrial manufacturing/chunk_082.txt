nology, with undesired wrap-around of a-Si layer on the front-side. The SSE process is performed to remove the wrap-around of a-Si, followed by BSG etching and subsequent ozone cleaning in the same wet-chemical tool. Here, it is assumed that the high temperature annealing process can be optimized in such a way that a th
