he efficiency of the respective solar module increases. Practically, 100% cannot be achieved because of unavoidable losses during operation (e.g., thermal loss due to increased surface temperature). In Fig. 11, the maximum PR (97.27%) is observed in HIT technology, whereas the minimum PR (41.02%) is found in a-Si technology. HIT technology is becoming increasingly popular because of its good efficiency. It consists of an intrinsic a-Si layer followed by a p-type a-Si layer deposited on a randoml
