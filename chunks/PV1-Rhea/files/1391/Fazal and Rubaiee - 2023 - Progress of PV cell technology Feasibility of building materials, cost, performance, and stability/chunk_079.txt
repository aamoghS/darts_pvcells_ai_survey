ciency and performance are in mass production and commercially used for different applications. In recent times, the multijunction cells (fourth generation) are receiving greater importance. The highest efficiencies of two, three and four junction cells reported by NREL in 2023 (Fig. 6b) are 32.9, 39.5, and 39.2% respectively. The efficiencies of these technolo
