ell configuration. Despite these challenges, Babics et al., [105] reported a PVK/Si tandem that shows high power output and retains 80% of its original power output after 1 year exposure under harshest weather. In general, tandem PV cells are expected to be a promising technology for next-generation mainstream solar cells as it shows clear edge of cost control, process simplicity, and very high efficiency.
