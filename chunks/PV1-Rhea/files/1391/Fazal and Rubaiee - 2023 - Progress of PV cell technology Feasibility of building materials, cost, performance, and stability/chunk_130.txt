and less silicon is needed. - It can be wrapped around a curve surface  - Has less efficiency and short life - It requires relatively larger area Gallium arsenide (GaAs) thin film - Higher conversion rate than c-Si - Has good temperature resistance - High cost, package complexity - Highly toxic; it causes health hazards Cadmium telluride (CdTe) - Has potential to compete with c-Si in future - High solar absorption - Toxic - Rare elements Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) - Direct bandgap mat
