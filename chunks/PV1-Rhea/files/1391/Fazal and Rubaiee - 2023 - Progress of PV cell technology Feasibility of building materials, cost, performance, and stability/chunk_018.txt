ganic metal halide with wider band gap have been recognized as a highly promising light absorbing material that improved drastically in the last couple of years. These materials having different band gaps are potentially used in the multijunction structure. There are currently PV modules in development expecting maximum efficiency of nearly 50%, which may hit the market sometime in the near future as an emerging PV technology. Table 1 demonstrates the chronological development of PV materials, e
