in PERC serves as an anti- reflecting coating to reduce the reflection of solar radiation. PERC cells offered reduced rear-surface recombination and improved higher infrared light absorption, which enables in achieving up to 1% more efficiency than the traditional c-Si cells [53]. The record efficiency of PERC was 25% [54] in 2019 and it is going to be around 27% in 2023 [55]. However, this p-type PERC cell efficiency is approaching its limit, and cell manufacturing cost reduction is also slowed
