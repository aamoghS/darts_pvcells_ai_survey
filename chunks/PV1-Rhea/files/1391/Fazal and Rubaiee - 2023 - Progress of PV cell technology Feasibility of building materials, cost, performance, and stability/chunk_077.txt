ilding materials The efficiencies of PV cells for various technologies obtained from different sources have been presented in the above sections. In this section, the highest cell efficiencies and building materials for different technologies have been illustrated. In 2023, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reported the highest cell efficiencies for different technologies. The graphical presentation of the data reported NREL is presented in Fig. 7. The highest cell efficiencies of sc-S
