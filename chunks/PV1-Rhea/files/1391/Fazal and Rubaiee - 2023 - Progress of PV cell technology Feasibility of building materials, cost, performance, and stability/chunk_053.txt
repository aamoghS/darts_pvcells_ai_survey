ecause of cadmium toxicity [72]. It is worth mentioning that III–V compounds, including GaAs, InP, AlGaAs, and InGaP are currently receiving considerable research attention in the domain of thin film technology. The efficiencies of these compound single-junction solar cells are reported at 29.1%, 24.1%, 16.6%, and 22%, respectively [73,74]. In fact, GaAs (Fig. 4d) emerged as one of the most popular III–V semiconductor thin film cells having some advantages of high electron mobility, direct b
