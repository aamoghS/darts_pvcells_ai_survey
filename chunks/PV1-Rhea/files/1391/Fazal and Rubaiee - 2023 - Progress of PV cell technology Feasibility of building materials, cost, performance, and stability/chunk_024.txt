PV material types Year and efficiency for specific PV materials Current challenges Silicon 1954: 6% was achieved by silicon p-n junction [31]. 1980–2018: 11–12% in 1980 and nearly 20% in 2018 were achieved by Al-BSF [32], 18% in 1984 [33]. Al-BSF was the mainstream PV technology till 2018. 2022–2023: 22.8–24.7% in 2022 was achieved by PERC  [34,35]; 24.24% by TOPCon  [36], 23.1% by
