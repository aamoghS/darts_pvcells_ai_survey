reases the tendency of light-induced degradation. A heterojunction is an interface between two regions or layers of dissimilar semiconductors. SHJ, variously known as heterojunction technology (HJT) or heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) is considered next technological step of PERC. It is one of the latest c-Si PV hybrid technologies that receives tremendous attentions by the top manufacturers. This technology sandwiches a crystalline silicon cell between two layers of amorphous thin
