 GaInP/GaAs/Ge triple junction (3 J) throughout 1990 s achieved 21â€“22% and 24% efficiency respectively [90,91]. The most commercially successful tandem cell developed in the space industry during that time was Ga0.5In0.5/Ga0.99In0.01As/Ge which achieved 32% efficiency under 1 Sun [92]. A TSC fabricated by direct epitaxial growth of III-V materials on Si has been reported in the current year, 2023 to achieve 35.9% conversion efficiency [93]. In another study, mechanically stacked GaInP/GaAs III
