 technology is expected to maintain the best price competitiveness among all other promising PV technologies in the future. The CdTe and CIGS modules presented slightly higher MSPs while III-V showed extremely high price in 2020. The module prices of PERC, SHJ, CdTe, CIGS, perovskites and IIIâ€“V are expected to be reduced by 2030 due to the developing technology and increased capacity of PV electricity generation. The 2030 projection assumes thinner wafers, reduces Ag paste use (drop to 50 mg/c
