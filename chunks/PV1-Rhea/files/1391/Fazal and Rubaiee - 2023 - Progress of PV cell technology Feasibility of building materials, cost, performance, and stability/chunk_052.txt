ause of the use of toxic cadmium. CIGS has a high absorption coefficient with a flexible thin layer, allowing a simple deposition of a flexible substrate. However, the module efficiency is still lower because of less developed upscaling. Limited indium reservation is another downside of this CIGS cell technology [71]. Researchers are now trying to find alternative materials for replacing a CdS window layer from CdTe (Fig. 4b) and CGIS (Fig. 4c) because of cadmium toxicity [72]. It is worth menti
