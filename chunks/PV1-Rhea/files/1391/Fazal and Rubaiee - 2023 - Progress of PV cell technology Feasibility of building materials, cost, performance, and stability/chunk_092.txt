nology in recent times due to its lowest energy price (40 USD/MWh) and highest cost reduction (89%) with time. Many researchers [122,123] conducted simulation and experimentations to identify the technical and cost-effective configuration for different PV technologies. In most cases, c-Si PV is repor
