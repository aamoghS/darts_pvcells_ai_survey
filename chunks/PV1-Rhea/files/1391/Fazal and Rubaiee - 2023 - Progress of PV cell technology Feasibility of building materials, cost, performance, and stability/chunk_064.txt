me the fundamental limitation of single junction c-Si [49]. Each layer of multijunction tandem cells having a specific band gap energy allows the cell to absorb solar radiation in a particular spectral region. Usually, the top layer uses a large band gap to absorb most visible spectra up to the bottom layer with low bandgap energy for absorbing radiation in the infrared region [88]. In this case, the non-absorbed solar radiation with broader wavelengths is transmitted to the next subcells for fu
