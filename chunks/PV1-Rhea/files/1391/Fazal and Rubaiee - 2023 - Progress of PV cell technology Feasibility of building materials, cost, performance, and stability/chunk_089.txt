 its affordability and reliability respectively which ultimately reflect the feasibility of the technology. This section presents the history of price reduction for different energy producing technologies, and then focusses on the cost analysis of various PV technologies. The cost for various energy generation technologies is compared with an established metric, namely, levelized cost of energy (LCOE). It accounts for the accumulated energy and associated costs over the lifetime of a production
