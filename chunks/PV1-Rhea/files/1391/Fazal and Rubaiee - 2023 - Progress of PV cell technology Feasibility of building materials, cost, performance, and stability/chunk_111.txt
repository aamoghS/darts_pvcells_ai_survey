owed by a p-type a-Si layer deposited on a randomly textured n-type Cz c-Si wafer to form a PN heterojunction. The PV industry has experienced tremendous growth because of increasing interest in green and sustainable energy, advances in PV performance, and PV cost reduction. Table 3 summarizes the current scenario of different PV technologies in terms of merits and demerits. Until now, c-Si, CdTe, and CIGS cells have overcome the threshold of industrial production and commercial usage. However,
