C). They added that the magnitudes of the temperature coefficient could strongly be correlated with the bad gap energy for the corresponding cell material. The approximate bad gap energies of these cell materials are 1.1 eV (c-Si), 1.8 eV (a-Si), ~1.2 eV (CIGS) and ~ 1.44 eV (CdTe). In Fig. 10, as the operating module temperature increases, the maxim
