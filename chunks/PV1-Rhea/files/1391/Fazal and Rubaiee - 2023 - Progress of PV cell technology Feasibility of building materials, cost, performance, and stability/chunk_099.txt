gies are under considerable research and their prices are expected to be decreased further to $0.29/watt and $0.18/watt, respectively by 2030. In recent times, perovskite on silicon tandem has received much popularity due to its high efficiency and low production cost. The estimated MSP of PVK/c-Si in 2020 is around $0.31/watt [8]. However, most of the new PV technologies are not feasible yet in their practical applications. As discussed above, utilization of some PV tech
