Thus far, the efficiency of existing DSSCs has been increased to 12%, which is still much lower than that of first- and second- generation PV cells [77]. Their commercial uses are limited because of liquid electrolytes, low stability and related issues [78]. Unlike DSSCs, organic solar cells (OSCs) have a planar
