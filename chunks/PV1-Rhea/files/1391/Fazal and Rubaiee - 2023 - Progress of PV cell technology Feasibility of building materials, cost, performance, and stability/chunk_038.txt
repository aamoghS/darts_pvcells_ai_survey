 silicon cell between two layers of amorphous thin film. As shown in Fig. 2(c), both sides of n-doped c-Si in SHJ structure are attached to an intrinsic and doped amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer followed by a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer. Indium -tin oxide (ITO) is commonly employed as TCO which improves lateral conduction and light absorp
