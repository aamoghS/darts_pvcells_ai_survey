uced prices, easy installation, and low maintenance cost [7,8]. Apart from c-Si PV technologies, many innovative PV cell technologies including thin film [9,10], dye-sensitized [11], organic [12], perovskite [13,14] and tandem multijunction cells [15,16] are currently under intensive research and development. Concerns on building materials [17,18], performance [19,20] cost [8,21], and stability [22,23] of various PV technologies have widely been reported in literatures. It appears that several r
