cells under 1 sun illumination [85â€“87]. Tandem cells could be referred to as fourth-generation solar cells, which have already been successfully commercialized at a smaller scale. It is usually manufactured by stacking several PN junctions of different bandgap semiconductor materials to overcome the fundamental limitation of single junction c
