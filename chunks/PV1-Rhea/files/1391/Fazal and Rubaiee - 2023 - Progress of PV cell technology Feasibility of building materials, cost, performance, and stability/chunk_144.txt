in 2020 and are expected to be reduced to $0.29/watt and $0.18/watt, respectively by 2030.  iii) The three-mainstream thin-film PV technologies are a-Si, CdTe, and CIGS, which in 2023 offer cell efficacies of 14%, 22.1%, and 23.4%, respectively. The IIIâ€“V compound solar cells, including GaAs, InP, AlGaAs, and InGaP are also considered potential thin film technology. The efficiencies of GaAs (29.1%), InP (24.1%), AlGaAs (16.6%), and InGaP (22%) are found to be quite good. However, the supply of
