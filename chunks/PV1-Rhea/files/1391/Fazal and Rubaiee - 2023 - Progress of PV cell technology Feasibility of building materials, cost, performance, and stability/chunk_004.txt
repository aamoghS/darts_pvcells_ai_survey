ceptances. Laboratory tests and data from actual services have suggested that IIIâ€“V/Si and PVK/Si tandem cells are the most promising candidates to compete with c-Si-based technology in near future due to their specific properties. However, their practical uses are limited owing to some challenges. Similarly, mainstream thin film technologies including CdTe, CIGS, and GaAs play a cr
