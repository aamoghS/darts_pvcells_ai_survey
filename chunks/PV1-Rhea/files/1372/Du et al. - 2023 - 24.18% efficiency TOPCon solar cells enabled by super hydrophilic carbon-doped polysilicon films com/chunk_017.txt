con wafers with a resistivity of 0.8–2.1  cm were used as the substrates with the purpose of characterization. Both the front and rear surfaces of c-Si wafers were polished by TMAH. An ultrathin SiO
x 
layer was grown in a concentrated nitric-sulfuric (CNS) acid bath [24] at 60

C for 10 min after standard RCA cleaning and HF dipping. Subsequently, a 5 nm thick C-doped amorphous silicon (n
