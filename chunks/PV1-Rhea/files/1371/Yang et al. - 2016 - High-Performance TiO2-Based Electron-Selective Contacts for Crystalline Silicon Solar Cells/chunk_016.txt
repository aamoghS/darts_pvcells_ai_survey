vity at the Si/TiO 2  heterojunction. A remarkably high PCE of 21.6% is achieved on a silicon solar 
cell featuring a full-area TiO 2 -based contact.   Figure    1  a shows the structure of n-type silicon solar cells with a full-area TiO 2  or SiO 2 /TiO 2  electron-selective contact at the rear side. The solar cells (2 cm × 2 cm) were fabricated on n-type FZ-Si wafers (1.0 Ω cm) with a thickness of ≈175 µm. The textured front side with random pyramids has a boron dif-
fused  p  +  emitter
