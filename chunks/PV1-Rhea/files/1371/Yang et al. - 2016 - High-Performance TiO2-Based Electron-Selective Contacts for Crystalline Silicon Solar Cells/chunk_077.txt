 2  contact at the rear (Si/Al contact directly) was prepared together for comparison.   Device Characterization : The  I–V  characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Xenon-lamp solar simulator under standard 1 sun 
conditions (100 mW cm sq −2 , AM 1.5 spectrum, 25 °C), which was calibrated using a certiﬁ ed reference cell from Fraunhofer ISE CalLab. 
The EQE of the solar cells was measured using a Protoﬂ ex Corporation QE measurement system (QE-1400-03). The front-side r
