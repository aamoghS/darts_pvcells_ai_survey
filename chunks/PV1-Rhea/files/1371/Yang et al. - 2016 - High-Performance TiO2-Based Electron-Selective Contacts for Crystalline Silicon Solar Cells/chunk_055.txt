 especially the FF, depend on a ﬁ nal FGA annealing signiﬁ cantly (also see Supplementary Table 2, Supporting Information). The champion efﬁ ciency shown in Table  1  is achieved by FGA annealing at 300 and 350 °C for cells with a full-area TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism involved, cross-sectional 
images of Si/TiO 2 /Al and Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2 /Al contacts after FGA annealing were obtained under bright-ﬁ eld (BF) and high reso-lution tra
