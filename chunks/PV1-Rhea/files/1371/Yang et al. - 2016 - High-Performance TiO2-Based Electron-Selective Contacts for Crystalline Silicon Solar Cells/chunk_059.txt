itanium oxide shows a higher conduc-tivity as the concentration of oxygen vacancies increases. [ 30,33 ]  The effect of titanium oxide composition change on cell 
parameters can be described in two aspects. First, the contact 
resistivity at the Si/TiO 2  and Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions decreases due to a higher conductivity of titanium oxide with 
high concentration of oxygen vacancies, and hence cellâ€™s FF 
improves. Agrawal et al. reported that high conductivity inter-
facial layer is o
