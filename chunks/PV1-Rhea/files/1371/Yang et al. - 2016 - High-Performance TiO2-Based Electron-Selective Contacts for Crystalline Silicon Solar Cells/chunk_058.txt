tially considered to be amorphous and stoi-
chiometric, [ 16 ]  has been drastically changed to an oxygen-deﬁ -cient TiO 2− 
x   phase with high concentration of oxygen vacancies. The elemental maps obtained by EFTEM also conﬁ rm that the titanium oxide interlayer (green color) becomes highly oxygen 
deﬁ cient, and the oxygen concentration at the Al/TiO 2  interface is much higher, as displayed with the red color.  It is well known that titanium oxide shows a higher conduc-tivity as the
