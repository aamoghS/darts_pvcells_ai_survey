n alternative approach to achieve high PCE silicon solar cell is via the implementation of carrier selective contacts 
(CSCs). [ 2â€“8 ]  A contact which extracts just one-type of carrier (electron or hole) from absorber (e.g., silicon) is termed as a 
CSC. A CSC is traditionally achieved by depositing a conductive 
layer (e.g., doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a-Si:H) over 
the thin passivation interlayer (e.g., intrinsic a-Si:H or SiO 2 ). For example, electron/hole-selective contacts can
