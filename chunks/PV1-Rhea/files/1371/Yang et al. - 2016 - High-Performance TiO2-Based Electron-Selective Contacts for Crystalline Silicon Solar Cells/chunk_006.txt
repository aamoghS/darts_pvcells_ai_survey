fore, it is essential to develop high quality CSCs that can be 
deposited easily, economically, and safely with minimal haz-
ardous risks.  Transition metal oxides (TMOs), which have been extensively investigated for charge injection and extraction in organic and 
perovskite solar cells, [ 9 ]  have attracted considerable attention as alternative CSCs for silicon solar cells because of their ease 
of deposition at a low cost (e.g., thermal evaporation, brush 
painting, spin-on and spray methods)
