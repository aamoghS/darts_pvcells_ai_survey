ar cells, there are some intrinsic challenges such as thermal instability 
and parasitic photon absorption of a-Si:H Ô¨Å lms, complicated deposition process, and high fabrication cost. Moreover, the 
doped a-Si:H layers are deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical 
vapor deposition (PECVD), which is a capital-intensive system 
with mandatory safety systems because of the pyrophoric silane 
and toxic boron/phosphorous gas precursors employed. There-
fore, it is essential to develop high quality CSCs
