to 79.1%), are improved 
obviously. This indicates that a reduction of carrier recombina-
tion and contact resistance occurs due to the insertion of an 
ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lm between n-Si and Al. A further efﬁ ciency improvement is achieved by inserting a tunnel SiO 2  (≈1.2 nm) Adv. Mater. 2016, 28, 5891–5897www.advmat.dewww.MaterialsViews.com
