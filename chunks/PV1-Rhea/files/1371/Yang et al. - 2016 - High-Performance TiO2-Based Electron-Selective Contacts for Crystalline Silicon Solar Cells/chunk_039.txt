ting that the passivation quality improved signiﬁ cantly by FGA annealing at evaluated temperatures for SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks capped with a thin TiO 2  layer (2.5 and 3.5 nm). However, a gradual passivation degradation instead of improvement is 
observed for SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack capped with a 4.5 nm TiO 2  layer. The best passivation quality with a lowest  S  eff  of 16 and 14 cm s −1  is achieved for SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks capped with 2.5 and 3.5 nm TiO 2  layer, respectively, after FGA anneali
