t prototype process has reached a conversion efficiency well over 21% which enables the manufacturing of a 
60-cell based module with a power of 310W. Our best cell so far has a conversion efficiency of 21.5% which has been confirmed by the calibration laboratory of Fraunhofer ISE. This is to our knowledge the highest efficiency reported for industrial-size silicon solar cells with screen-printed metal front and rear contacts.
