 silicon solar cells for passivation of p+ doped surface. The thermal stability of the Al

 is important as the film would go through a high temperature firing process. The deterioration in passivation quality after firing is due to an increase in interface trap density, Dit [1], resulting from the dissociation of interfacial Si-H bonds during the firing process, with hydrogen released from the passivation film. Blistering occurs [2] when hydrogen species (atom, ion or H
2
 molecules) canâ€™t
