Comparing the intensity of these specific vibration modes, it can be noted that the samples with treatment B showed stronger absorbance than the samples with treatment A. We supposed that with treatment B, hydrogen species preferentially moved into the oxide layer since molecular hydrogen has a higher diffusivity [11] within SiO
2 
than in SiN
X
. The hydrogen will out-diffuse from the Al
2O3
 layer due to the high firing temperature.
