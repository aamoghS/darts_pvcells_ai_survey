using PECVD. The samples were fired in an industrial belt driven fast firing furnace at a set peak 
temperature. We surveyed the appearance of our samples by ZETA’s 3D-OM, and analyzed the bonding 
configuration by BRUKER’s FT-IR spectrometer. We also used Sinton Instrument’s Suns-Voc to monitor the implied Voc.    3.
