er which it fails is determined (and depicted in the result diagram Fig. 2). The degradation time is estimated to be in the middle of this time span. The solder-joint stability is evaluated by a 90째-peel-test, which is passed if the peel force of the solder joints is higher than >1 N/mm. Furthermore, to determine a relationship between solder-joint stability and temperature, e.g. an Arrhenius law, this is repeated with different samples at three temperatures: 130째C, 140째C or 150째C.
