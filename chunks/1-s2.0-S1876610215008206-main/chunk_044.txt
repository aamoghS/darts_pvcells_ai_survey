Fig. 3: The difference between the measured cell efficiencies and the median efficiency of the reference Al group III  is depicted in absolute percent. Additionally, for each group the median efficiency is depicted. The results show that the efficiency of the n-type PERT cells is not influenced by an added solder stack. Fig. 3 shows that the
