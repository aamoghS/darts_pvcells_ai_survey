Table 3 shows, that samples with the optimized TiN barrier, deposited at 30 kW and 230°C, can successfully be soldered with sufficient adhesion after a moderate annealing step of 10 min at 350°C (denoted ‘ok’ in Table 3), but fail solder attempt or peel test after annealing for 10 min at 400°C (denoted ‘fail’ in Table 3).
