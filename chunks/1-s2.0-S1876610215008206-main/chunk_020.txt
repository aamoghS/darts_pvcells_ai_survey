 temperatures: 130°C, 140°C or 150°C.  Additionally, the developed metallization scheme is applied to solar cells. Therefore n-type PERT (Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally diffused) solar cells are fabricated from 156 mm n-type Cz Si wafers. The cells possess a diffused p+-doped emitter on the front side and an n+-doped back surface field on the rear side. The front side is metallized and contacted by screen-printing and a fast-firing step. The passivation on the rear side is locally opened
