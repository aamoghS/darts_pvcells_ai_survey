 of half open filed and nearby white building. It is clear that rear side absorption is the main reason for the power gain of the bifacial modules.   Fig. 5. Output gains (Ref 1, Ref 2 and Ref 3: monofacial; under grass, sand, snow: bifacial) 4. Conclusion and outlook Efficiency greater than 20% was obtained on nPERT solar cells by using boron spin-on coating and POCl3 diffusion. Bifacial glass-glass module shows an excellent anti-PID and LID-free performance. Power output gains of bifacial modu
