ells (PERT) structure solar cell combined boron spin-on with POCl3 diffusion and double sides H-pattern screen printing metallization. With the assistance of the spin-on single side doping method, an average efficiency of 20% with 90% bifaciality was obtained in our laboratory, 6*10 cells bifacial glass-glass modules were fabricated in industrial line. The PID about 3.5% was obtained after 600 hrs under 85��-85% humidity with a bias of -1000 V, while the LID was about 0.19 % under the IEC st
