 long time before the installation to get a stable condition. The output was normalized by 1 kW for each group.   Fig. 4. On-site Photo and System Set-up Schematic Diagram The power output comparison is shown in Fig.5. Power gains of different background were almost 7.6% on grass, 15% on sand and 29.2% on snow, which just fit well with other researchers [5, 6] and the simulation. Power gains in the experiment is extremely high for the reflections of half open filed and nearby white building. It
