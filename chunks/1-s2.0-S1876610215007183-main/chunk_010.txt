 reactions without involving itself in the reaction. There are positive and negative catalysts. The positive catalyst or catalyst increases the rate of the reaction, but the negative catalyst delays the rate of a reaction [5]. Catalytic processes are heterogeneous (the catalyst, typically a solid, is in a different phase from the reactants) and homogeneous (the 
catalyst is in the same phase, typically liquid, as the reactants) [6]. The homogeneous and environmentally 
hazardous catalysts are mi
