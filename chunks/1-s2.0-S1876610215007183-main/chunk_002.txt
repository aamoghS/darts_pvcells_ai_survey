it may be used in the electrolysis process as a solid electrocatalyst to reduce or replace chemical catalysts. Design of Experiment and Statgraphics software were used for the research. The goal of the experiment was to analyze possibilities of ash use as an electrolyte component. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statgraphics statistical data analysis tool and the empirical models with correlation equations describing the pH value of analyzing samples. The results were validated
