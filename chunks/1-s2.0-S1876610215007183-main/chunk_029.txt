H and temperature at the 95.0 % or higher confidence level. The R-Squared statistic indicates that the model as fitted explains 6.73 % of the variability in pH. The correlation coefficient equals �í0.26, indicating a relatively weak relationship between the variables.  The standard error of the estimate shows the standard deviation of the residuals to be 0.83. The correlation between pH and mixture is strong. Since the P-value in the ANOVA table is less than 0.05, there is a statistically sig
