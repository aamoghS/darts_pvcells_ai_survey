 may be used in electrolysis process as solid electrocatalyst to reduce or replace chemical catalysts. Zhang (2011) mentioned that some improvements are still possible in alkaline water electrolysis. One scientific publication provides attempts to identify alternative electrocatalysts and develop alternative separators [1]. There are also scientific researches according ash use as catalysts in [9, 10], but there were no publications found where biomass ash use as a catalyst in the electrolysis p
