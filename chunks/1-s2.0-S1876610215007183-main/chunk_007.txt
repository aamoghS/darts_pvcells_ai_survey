; ï¿½xsolid oxide (SO) technology.   There are three differences between water electrolysis. The main and the first difference between three technologies relates to electrolyte type used in process OH- ions in alkaline water electrolysis, H+ ions in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis and O2- ions in solid oxides water electrolysis. The second difference between technologies relates to the site water consumption: it is a cathode with alkaline water electrolysis and solid oxides water ele
