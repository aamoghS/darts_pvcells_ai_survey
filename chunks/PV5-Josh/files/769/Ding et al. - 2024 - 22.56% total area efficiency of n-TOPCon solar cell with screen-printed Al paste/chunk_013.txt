 the rear side.
As shown in the flowchart, the wafers were textured in KOH solution to reduce the reflection of light in the front side firstly, then the front boron emitter (p
+
emitter, 120 /sq) was formed in a quartz tube furnace in the atmosphere of BCl
3 
gas. After the p
+
emitter was fabricated, the rear side of the wafers was polished by HF and HNO
3 
mixed solution to remove the boron silicate glass (BSG) and the emitter on the rear side and the edges formed during boron diffusion. The
