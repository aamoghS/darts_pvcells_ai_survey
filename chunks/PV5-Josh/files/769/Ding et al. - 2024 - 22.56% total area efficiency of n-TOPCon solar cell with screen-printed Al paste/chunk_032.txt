paste melt slowly and the silicon from paste or n +-poly-Si dissolved in melted Al as the temperature increases (ABC). The second stage is the saturation of silicon dissolved in Al-Si alloy melt occurring at point C (T
peak
), and the process lasts for a short time usually. The final stage is the decrease of temperature, during the cooling process of the melt, the solubility of silicon in Al-Si alloy melt decreases, which leads to more silicon precipitate from the melt to form a back surface f
