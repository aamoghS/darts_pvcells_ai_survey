, the total dark saturation current density of the cells can be expressed by formula(4), which is composed of bulk saturation current density J
0,bulk 
and surface dark saturation current density, and the values of J
0,total 
can be measured by WCT-120(SunsVoc). The surface is divided into front and rear sides, and each side is further subdivided into metallization and non-metallization regions. In formula (4), J
