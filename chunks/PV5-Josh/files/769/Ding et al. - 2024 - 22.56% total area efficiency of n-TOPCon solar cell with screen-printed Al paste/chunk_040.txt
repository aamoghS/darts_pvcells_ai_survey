on the diffusion speed of Si is greater than that of Al, therefore, the silicon in Al-Si alloy transfer to the Al layers occurred in the process, which led to the reduction of the silicon content in the melt, and more and more silicon from n
+
-poly-Si diffused to the melt to maintain phase balance. So, the voids formed in the alloy when the silicon diffused and the melt flow.
The shape of metal grids can also affect the performance of solar cells, the aspect ratio (height/width) is used to indi
