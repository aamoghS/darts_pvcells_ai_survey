Photoluminescence (PL) images and the loss of iV
oc 
(iV

) are used as an indication of damage after LCO. In addition, the microstructure was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to evaluate the ablation state of the SiN
x 
passivation layer. Moreover, the contact interface of Al paste and n
+
- poly-Si was analyzed by SEM and EDS as well.
