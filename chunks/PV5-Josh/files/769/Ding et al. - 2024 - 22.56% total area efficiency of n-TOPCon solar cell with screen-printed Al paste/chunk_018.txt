 resistance (R

), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (E
ff
) of cells were measured by an IV tester under 1-sun illumination (AM 1.5). The implied V
oc 
(iV
oc
) and the dark saturation current density (J
0
) of the control samples were measured by a WCT-120 lifetime tester under the excess carrier density of 3 Ã—10
15
. The transmission line method (TLM) model 
[18]
was used to measure the line resistance and the contact resistivity (

) of the elec
