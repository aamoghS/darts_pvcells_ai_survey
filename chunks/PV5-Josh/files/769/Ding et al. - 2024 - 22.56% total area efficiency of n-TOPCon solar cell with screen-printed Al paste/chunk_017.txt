vely, after that, the cells were sintered in a belt furnace with the curve shown in

. The addition of silicon in Al paste can inhabit the violent reaction between Al paste and n
+
-poly-Si, but also decreased the grids conductivity. Thus, the Al paste with different weight percentages of silicon was applied in metallization (

).
