ntage of silicon in Al paste lower than 18 %, there was a clear interlayer between Al-Si alloy and silicon bulk, which caused by the formed of Al-Si solid solutions ( phase, BSF).
The thickness of BSF decreased with the increasing silicon weight percentage in Al paste, when the added silicon was 1 wt%–5 wt%, the thickness of BSF was 3.67
