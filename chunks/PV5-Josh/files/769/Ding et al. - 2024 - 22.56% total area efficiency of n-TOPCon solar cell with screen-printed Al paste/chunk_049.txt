semiconductor contact influenced the fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (V

), short-circuit current (I

). 
Fig. 9
describes the performance of the TOPCon cells printed with Al paste on the rear side.
Results show that, the Isc has an obvious decreasing trend when the weight percentage of silicon increased. The Al-Si contact interface affected long wave light absorption (900 nmâ€“1000 nm) on the rear side.
