-poly-Si and the TOPCon structure would be destroyed.
To protect the passivation structure, different weight percentages of silicon were added into the Al paste, so the Al melt reacted with the silicon from the paste first, and less from n
+
-poly-Si diffused into the melt. The microscopic morphology and schematic of the cross-section at the Al-Si contact interface as shown in
