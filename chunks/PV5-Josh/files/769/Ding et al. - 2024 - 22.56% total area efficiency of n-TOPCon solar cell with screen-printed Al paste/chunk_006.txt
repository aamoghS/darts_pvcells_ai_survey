. Currently, the silicon solar cells include tunneling oxide passivation contact (TOPCon) 
[2]
, hetero-junction (HJT) 
[3]
and integrated-back contact cells (IBC) 
[4]
are been investigated widely. Among them, TOPCon solar cells has been commercial produced extensively due to its excellent passivation structure (SiO
x 
+n
+
-poly-Si) and its low cost to upgrade the production lines from PERC solar cells.
