-poly-Si, even the temperature reached Al melting temperature, but the high-temperature duration was too short, so the Al particles didnâ€™t obtain enough energy to melt, and the grids maintain the original morphology without collapse.
On the contrary side, the Al paste with a higher weight percentage of silicon provided enough silicon for Al particles to form Al-Si alloy, therefore, all the Al particles reacted during the sintering process, and led to the grids collap
