B-doped surface source. The excellent printing characteristics of this film ensure uniform B-doping of Si wafers during the subsequent thermal diffusion process. A detailed account of the specific preparation process and process optimization can be found in prior work [12]. 3.2.Thermal diffusion experiment and TOPCON cell preparation The preparation of thermal diffusion experimental samples involved the use of Czochralski (Cz) n-type c-Si wafers with 〈100〉orientation, measuring 182 mm ×182
