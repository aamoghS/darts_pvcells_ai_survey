as then placed in a tube diffusion furnace for B diffusion. This process resulted in the formation of both shallow and heavily doped B zones, with BSG forming on the B expansion surface. The Si wafer underwent B diffusion within a high-temperature annealing (20 min at 950â„ƒ) furnace to establish the final PN junction, as depicted in Fig. 2. After removing the BSG layer from the back of the Si wafer using a chain hydrofluoric acid machine. Subsequently, the Si wafer was transferred to an alkalin
