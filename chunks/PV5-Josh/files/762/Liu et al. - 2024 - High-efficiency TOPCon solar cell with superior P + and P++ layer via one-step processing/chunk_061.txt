B atoms occurs only inside the B source, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). However, with the increase of temperature, the diffusion coefficient of B continues to increase, and B atoms continue to diffuse into Si along the z axis, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), (c) and (d). The simulation results indicate: when the B source concentration in the Si paste remains constant, higher temperatures result in larger diffusion coefficients, leading to a greater influx of B atoms into the Si matrix and deeper diffusion dept
