ce the quality of the PN junction, create a uniform and effective B-doped layer on the Si wafer surface, and reduce defects on the PN junction surface. Additionally, this process reduces the series resistance in the PN junction region and minimizes current losses within the solar cell, thus improving the FF. It is important to note that this study has only conducted limited foundational research on B diffusion through molecular dynamics simulation. Further work is needed to develop and refine th
