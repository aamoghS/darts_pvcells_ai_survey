This pattern indicates a gradual diffusion of B atoms into the Si wafer. At 850 
◦
C, the sheet resistance decreases rapidly initially, but as time progresses, the surface source concentration diminishes, and the sheet resistance stabilizes until reaching 1050

C. These findings align well with the simulation results presented in Fig. 6. As the temperature rises, the concentration of B atoms, or the doping concentration, increases, elevating the carrier concentration of the Si wafer and en
