tures and longer diffusion times result in greater diffusion depths. In addition, it can be clearly seen from the figure that after the temperature reaches 950℃, the average diffusion depth increases significantly, and the maximum diffusion depth also increases significantly. This shows that 950℃ is the turning point of B diffusion. 4.1.2.Diffusion coefficient To pre
