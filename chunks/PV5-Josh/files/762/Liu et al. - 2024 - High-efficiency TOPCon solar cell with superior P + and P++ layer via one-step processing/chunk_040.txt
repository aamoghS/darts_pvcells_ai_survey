ifferent temperatures Fig. 4 and 5 depict the B atom diffusion process. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the position distribution of B atoms at various temperatures is shown, while Fig. 5 displays the position distribution of B atoms at different time intervals at 950

C. The quantity and depth of B atom diffusion are influenced not only by the diffusion temperature but also by the duration of diffusion. Higher temperatures and longer durations result in increased B atom diffusion from the source
