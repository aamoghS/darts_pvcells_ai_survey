Following the preparation of the pretreated wafer, Si paste is screen- printed onto the front surface opening to create a densely packed linear Si paste area, as illustrated in Fig. 10 (c). The cross-section of the Si paste region is depicted in Fig. 10 (d). After drying for approximately 30 s at 250
