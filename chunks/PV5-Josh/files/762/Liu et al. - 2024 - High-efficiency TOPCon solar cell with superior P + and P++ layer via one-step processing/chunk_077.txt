s FF. Excessive B doping concentration can result in an excessive surface dose and increased current loss in the cell. Conversely, a B doping concentration that is too low may not effectively enhance the FF. The high B surface doping concentration increases the contact resistance between the metal electrode and the Si substrate. In solar cells, the surface recombination rate refers to the speed of recombination of photogenerated carriers after reaching the surface. The higher surface recombinati
