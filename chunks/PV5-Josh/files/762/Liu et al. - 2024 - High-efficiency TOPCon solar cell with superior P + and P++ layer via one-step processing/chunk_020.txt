tantiated accuracy in simulating Si interactions. For the interactions involving B-Si and B-B, the nuclear force Yukawa [24] potential was employed. The initial configuration of the B-Si diffusion model comprised monocrystalline Si at the bottom and B-doped Si at the top. The monocrystalline Si was oriented along the (1,0,0) ideal plane, with a vacancy content of 0.01 %. To facilitate the study of B diffusion behavior, 10 % of Si atoms were randomly replaced by B atoms in the upper section of th
