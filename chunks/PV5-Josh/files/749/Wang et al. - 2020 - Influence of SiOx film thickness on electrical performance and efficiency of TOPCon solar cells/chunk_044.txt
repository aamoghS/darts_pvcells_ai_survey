ls 
have 
the 
same 
pseudo 
fill 
factor 
(pFF), 
because 
these 
cells 
were 
from 
the 
same 
wafers 
and 
were 
manufactured 
in 
the 
same 
processes. 
The 
shunt 
resistance 
of 
Si 
wafer 
based 
solar 
cells 
with 
three 
conditions 
keeps 
the 
same 
value. 
However, 
the 
R
ser 
value 
of 
the 
wafer 
with 
1.55 
nm 
oxide 
layer 
is 
smaller 
than 
the 
ones 
with 
1.25 
nm 
and 
1.43 
nm 
oxide 
layers. 
Therefore, 
the 
FF 
loss 
for 
the 
cells 
with 
1.25 
nm 
and 
1.43 
nm 
oxide
