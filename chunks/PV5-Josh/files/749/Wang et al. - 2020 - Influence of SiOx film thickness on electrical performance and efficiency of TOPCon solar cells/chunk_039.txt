For 
oxide 
layer 
thickness 
<
1.6nm, 
the 
oxide
â€™
s 
integrity 
weakens 
at 
high-temperature 
annealing. 
Some 
phenomenon, 
such 
as 
broken-up 
and 
balling-up, 
is 
present 
[

Furthermore, 
when 
the 
annealing 
process 
keep 
stable, 
the 
thinner 
oxide 
layer 
easily 
tends 
to 
break 
up 
or 
balling 
up
