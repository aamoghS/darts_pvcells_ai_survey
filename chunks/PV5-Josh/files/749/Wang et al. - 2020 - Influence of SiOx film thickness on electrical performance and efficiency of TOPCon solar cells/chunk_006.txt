addressing 
the 
issue 
of 
reducing 
metal 
recombination 
and 
implementing 
a 
selective 
emitter.   
1.
Introduction 
Currently, 
passivated 
emitter 
and 
rear 
solar 
cell 
(PERC) 
is 
the 
mainstream 
production 
with 
a 
median 
efficiency 
of 
22%. 
However, 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
increase 
cell 
efficiency 
by 
the 
present 
technologies 
and 
pro
-
cesses. 
There 
are 
two 
key 
factors 
limiting 
the 
efficiency 
of 
crystalline 
silicon 
solar 
cells. 
One 
is
