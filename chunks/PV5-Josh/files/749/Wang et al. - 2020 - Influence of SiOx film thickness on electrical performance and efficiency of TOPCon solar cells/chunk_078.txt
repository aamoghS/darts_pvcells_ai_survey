in 
terms 
of 
current 
density 
was 
derived 
from 
the 
simulation,

Besides 
the 
metal 
shading 
losses, 
losses 
resulted 
mainly 
from 
ARC 
reflectance 
and 
NIR 
parasitic 
absorption 
losses, 
which 
partly 
included 
the 
light 
trapping 
capability 
of 
the 
TOPCon 
cells. 
The 
light 
trapping 
capability 
may 
be 
evaluated 
looking 
at 
the 
Yablonovitch 
limit 
(ideal 
light 
trapping) 
of 
46.43 
mA/cm
