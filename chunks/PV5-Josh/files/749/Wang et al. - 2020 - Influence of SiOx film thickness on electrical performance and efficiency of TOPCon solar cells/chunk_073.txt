SiO

layer. 
Furthermore, 
according 
to 
ECV 
profiles, 
the 
P 
concentration 
at 
the 
interfacial 
oxide 
layer 
for 
thin 
SiO
x 
layer 
is 
higher 
than 
that 
for 
1.55 
nm 
thick 
SiO
x 
layer. 
The 
increase 
in 
contact 
resistivity 
value 
in 
fact 
matches 
the 
amount 
of 
series 
resistance 
increased 
and 
FF 
loss 
of 
the 
cell 
(see 
Figs. 
5 
and

). 
These 
experimental 
results 
confirm 
that 
the 
quality 
of 
1.25 
nm 
thin 
SiO
x 
layer 
is 
not 
good,
