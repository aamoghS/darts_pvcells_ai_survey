At 
present, 
there 
are 
two 
categories 
of 
passivated 
oxide 
layers 
[

]. 
One 
is 
SiO
x 
layer 
thickness 
<
1.6 
nm, 
the 
conduction 
mechanism 
is 
tunneling. 
The 
other 
is 
SiO
x 
layer 
thickness 
>
2nm, 
the 
conduction 
mechanism 
is 
pinhole. 
The 
annealing 
process, 
such 
as 
temperature 
and 
duration 
is 
a 
key 
technique.
