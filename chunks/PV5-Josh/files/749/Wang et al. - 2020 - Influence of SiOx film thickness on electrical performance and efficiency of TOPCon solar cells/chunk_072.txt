pointed 
out 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
control 
the 
density 
of 
pinholes 
through 
a 
well-controlled 
anneal 
process. 
At 
the

the 
series 
resistance 
of 
the 
wafer 
with 
thin 
SiO

layer 
is 
larger 
than 
the 
one 
of 
the 
wafer 
with 
thick 
SiO
x 
layer, 
due 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
locally 
very 
thin 
SiO

regions 
in 
the 
thin 
SiO

layer.
