ing 
loss, 
hence 
higher 
series 
resistance 
and 
lower 
FF 
values 
would 
be 
obtained. 
Optimization 
of 
the 
front 
side 
metallization 
should 
take 
all 
these 
factors 
into 
account. 
The 
reflectance 
loss 
at 
the 
cell 
front 
side 
may 
be 
reduced 
by 
tuning 
the 
ARC 
optical 
properties, 
such 
as 
refraction 
index 
and 
thickness, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
improved 
front 
surface 
texturing 
for 
better 
light-trapping.
