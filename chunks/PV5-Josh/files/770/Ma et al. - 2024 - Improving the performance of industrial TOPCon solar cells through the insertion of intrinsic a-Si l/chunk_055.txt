ilm was further confirmed by local HR-TEM images. The pronounced crystallization patterns in the poly-Si film were corroborated by distinct diffraction spots evident in the Fourier trans

form. In contrast to the G2 samples, the Baseline samples exhibited more pronounced polycrystalline structures, alongside amorphous rings with a greater number of discernible diffraction spots. This observation indicated a heightened level of crystallinity following the annealing process [49]. Moreover, the cr
