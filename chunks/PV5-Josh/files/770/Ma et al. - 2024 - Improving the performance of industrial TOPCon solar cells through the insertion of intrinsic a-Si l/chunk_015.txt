 oxidized Si is strongly prone to blistering, both during deposition and thermal annealing, due to some of the hydrogen from the film accumulating at the film/SiO
x 
interface and growing into pressurized pockets causing the blistering. Blistering deteriorates the properties of the poly-Si/SiO
x 
interface due to the blistered areas being severely hampered, leading to the prevention of charge-carrier collection. In the worst case, blisters may rupture from the surface of poly-Si, resulting in di
