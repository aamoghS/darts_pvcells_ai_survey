fects on the performance of TOPCon solar cells. This strategy effectively controlled the doping profile, mitigating the excessive diffusion of phosphorus dopants into the c-Si substrate and consequently reducing recombination losses. Detailed characterizations were carried out to uncover the underlying mechanisms. OM and SEM analyses demon
