ation layers has been introduced. The primary objective of this structure is to retard the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate. This study entails comprehensive characterizations to delve into the underlying mechanisms of films with the integrated a-Si (i) layer, including surface microscopy, active dopants profile, crystallographic structure, elemental distribution, and electrical properties. Finally, we have fabricated the industrial-sized TOPCon solar cells with an average efficienc
