owing the annealing process [49]. Moreover, the cross-sectional EDS distributions and net intensity for the two related samples were shown in Fig. 5(c and f) and Fig. 5(g), respectively. A phosphorus signal could be observed in the SiO
x 
layer and c-Si substrate as shown in Fig. 5(c and f). The cumulative intensity of Si and O atoms across the specific section (yellow dashed line illustrated in Fig. 5(b and e)) indicated the emergence of a tunneling oxide layer. To further investigate the chang
