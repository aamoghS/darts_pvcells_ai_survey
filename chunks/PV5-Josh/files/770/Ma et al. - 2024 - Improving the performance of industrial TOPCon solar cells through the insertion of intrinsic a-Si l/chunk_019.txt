al equilibrium, itâ€™s essential to precisely manage and optimize the dopant concentration within the poly-Si film following the annealing process. Several works [39,40] have investigated the effect of additive intrinsic a-Si layer between SiO
x 
and doped a-Si (p) on the performance of p-TOPCon, indicating that the insertion of intrinsic a-Si layer could effectively regulate the doping distribution in the c-Si/SiO
x
/doped poly-Si structure, thereby improving the passivation performance of cell
