s in the heavily doped poly-Si layer can diffuse into the c-Si substrate, forming a buried dopant region (called in-diffusion dopant) near the c-Si interface. Although the existence of in-diffusion dopants is beneficial for metal contact to a certain extent and thus reduces contact resistance, however, excessive dopants could severely weaken the interfacial passivation quality. To control dopant diffusion into the Si substrate and attain an optimal equilibrium, itâ€™s essential to precisely mana
