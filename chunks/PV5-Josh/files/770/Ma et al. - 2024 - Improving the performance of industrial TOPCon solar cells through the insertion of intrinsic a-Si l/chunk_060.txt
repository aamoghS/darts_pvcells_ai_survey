 thickness, implying that the introduction of a-Si (i) did not lead to additional optical absorption loss. However, the FF value decreased with increasing a-Si (i) thickness, particularly in the G4 group. This reduction was primarily due to the limited diffusion of P atoms into the substrate, resulting in poor metal
