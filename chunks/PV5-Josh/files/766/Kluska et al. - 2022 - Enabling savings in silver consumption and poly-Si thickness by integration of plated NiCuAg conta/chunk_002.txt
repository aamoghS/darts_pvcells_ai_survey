) is analysed and the impact of laser-induced damage during laser contact opening (LCO) is characterized. Furthermore, mitigation strategies to systematic fill factor losses are developed including laser-induced nano-roughness within the LCO to increase contact adhesion and current-annealing to improve contact resistance.
