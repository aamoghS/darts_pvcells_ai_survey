be identified for the plated groups. First, solar cells with locally low contact adhesion on the rear side, leading to significant drops in FF well below 80% and large areas with low EL intensity. Second, minor deviations in FF in the range of 77–82% compared to the plated champion solar cell and local spots with low EL intensity. These kinds of defects were sensitive on LECO current annealing, which lead to an increase in FF by 1–2%abs. In the following the microscopic origins and mitigatio
