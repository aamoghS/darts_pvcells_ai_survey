solar cells with contact adhesion failures shows no significant exploits laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) within the LCO Fig. 4 a). The LCO of solar cells with no contact adhesion failures and FF above 80% shows LIPSS Fig. 4 b). The origin of these differences in LCO formation are still under investigation. Further characterizations demonstrated that LIPSS can also be manufactured on samples with a planarized surface after alkaline chemical edge isolation Fig. 4 c). Different ap
