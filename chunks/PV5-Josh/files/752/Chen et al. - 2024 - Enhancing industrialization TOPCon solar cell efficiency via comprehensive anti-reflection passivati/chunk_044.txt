cy gain by PH processing. 4.Conclusions In conclusion, our study has highlighted significant achievements in the optimization of TOPCon solar cells, with two key approaches on the anti-reflection passivation films. Firstly, for the front side film, we implemented a one-step PO process utilizing N

O plasma. This process remarkably enhanced the quality of the in-line ALD-deposited AlOx film by repairing the oxygen vacancy defects within it. The disruption of Oâ€“H bonds during this process addit
