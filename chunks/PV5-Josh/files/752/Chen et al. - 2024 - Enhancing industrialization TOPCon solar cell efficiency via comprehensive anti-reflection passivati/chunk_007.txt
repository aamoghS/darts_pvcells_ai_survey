icon passivating contact structure, when subjected to the firing process required for metallization, can suffer from substantial degradation in passivation quality [12]. To address this issue, a frequent practice is to shield the polysilicon with a hydrogen-rich SiN
x 
film, which effectively prevents the occurrence of passivation quality degradation and leads to a notable improvement in the overall passivation performance, due to the pres
