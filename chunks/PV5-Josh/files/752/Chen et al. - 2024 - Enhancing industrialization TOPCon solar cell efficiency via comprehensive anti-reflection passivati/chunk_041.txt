es without PH treatment. This enrichment of H atoms near SiO
x 
proves beneficial as it contributes to a reduction in the density of unsaturated suspended bonds on the silicon surface. Moreover, the higher H content more effectively inhibits the passivation quality degradation of the passivating contacts during the firing process [13,26]. The outcome is evident in the samples subjected to PH treatment, displaying higher mean values of iV
