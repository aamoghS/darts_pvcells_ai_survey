from the surface of the wafer, the preparation of the anti-reflection passivation film on the front side starts with the deposition of a ~10 nm AlO
x 
film by an in-line single side deposition atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Ideal Deposition Equipment & Applications Co., Ltd.), which is the most mainstream commercial TOPCon solar cell AlOx deposition equipment available. Subsequently, SiN

y 
and SiO

were sequentially deposited on AlO
