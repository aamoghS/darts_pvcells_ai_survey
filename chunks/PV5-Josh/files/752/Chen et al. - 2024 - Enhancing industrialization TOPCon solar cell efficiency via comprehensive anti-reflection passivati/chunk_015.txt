 series of critical processes to established selective boron emitters on the front side of the wafers: thermal boron diffusion, laser treatment, and post thermal oxidation, ensuring controlled sheet resistances of ~250 / in the light doped region and ~90 / in the heavy doped region. Following this step, the borosilicate glass layer was removed from the rear and edge of the wafer, leaving the front surface intact. Subsequently, the wafer underwent an alkali polishing process to remove the bor
