ABSTRACT  
This study focuses on enhancing the performance of n-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells by exploring the optimization of both front and rear film layers. For the front film, we implement a one-step plasma oxidation process before depositing silicon nitride on alumina, a
