 Table 4. The Poly-SE with a n
+
-poly-Si layer of 50 nm had a higher E
ff 
of approximately 24.58%, thus obtaining a gain of 0.18% compared to BKM (110 nm), mainly owing to the increase J
sc 
of 0.49 mA/cm
2 
and a slight advantage of J
0,total
. We could not obtain a high FF, mainly because of the high lateral resistance of the n
+
-poly-Si layer.  J
