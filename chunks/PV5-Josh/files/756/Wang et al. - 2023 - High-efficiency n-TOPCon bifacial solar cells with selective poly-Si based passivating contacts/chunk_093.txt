E solar cells, the current loss analysis was carried out using the Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 software (based on the Yablonovitch limit of 46.43 mA/cm

) as shown in Fig. 14. Here, there are three primary advantages of Poly-SE from BKM, the one is "NIR parasitic absorption loss", the J

is increased by 0.59 mA/cm
