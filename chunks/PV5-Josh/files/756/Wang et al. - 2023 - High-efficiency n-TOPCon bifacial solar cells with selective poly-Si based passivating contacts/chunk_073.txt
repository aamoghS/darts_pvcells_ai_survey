 layer has only one peak at wavelength of about 400 nm, and the reflectance (R) reaches to 45%. However, the samples with n

-poly-Si layer contain two peaks at wavelengths of 450 and 550 nm, and the R value is smaller than that of the etched surface at wavelengths of 450~ 800 nm. From the above analysis, the poly-Si layer is unsuited to be deposited in the front of solar cell due to much more parasitic absorption loss. Maybe it is because that the proportion of a-Si in poly-Si would retain app
