e some risks in the manufacturing solar cell process due to the dopant diffusion, the damage to the Si surface and over-alignment losses in the alignment with the front electrode during the printing process [18]. Additional masking and etching processes need to prevent these problems and to control the doping profiles. In this work, the selective emitter is formed by 3D printing mask technology, which could avoid the surface damage caused by other methods such as laser-assisted doping. The fabri
