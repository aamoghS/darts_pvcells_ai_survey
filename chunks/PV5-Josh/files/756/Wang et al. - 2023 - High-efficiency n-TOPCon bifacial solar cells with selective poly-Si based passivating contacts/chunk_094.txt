h the result of simulation. The others are “blue loss” and “base collection loss”, which get benefit from the additional RCA cleaning (Clean 1) and the gettering effect of P doping diffusion process. However, Poly-SE showed a disadvantage in terms of “ARC reflectance” and “Front surface escape”, which is related to the polishing process leading to damage the front surface texture and to increase the reflectance.
