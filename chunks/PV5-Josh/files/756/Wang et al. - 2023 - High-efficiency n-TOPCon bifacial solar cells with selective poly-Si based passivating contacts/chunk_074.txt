the proportion of a-Si in poly-Si would retain approximate 20% after a high-temperature annealing process and the absorption coefficient of a-Si:H is higher than that of poly-Si in the wavelength of 400â€“700 nm for intensive photon energy leading to a high parasitic absorption loss [23,37]. On the contrary, it is suitable for the rear of solar cell. The R increased by decreasing G

from 2400 to 1200 sccm, which has a high free carrier absorption (FCA) loss probably due to high doping, it
