polysilicon (poly-Si) layer, which uses the concept of tunnel selectivity engineering. By employing thin SiO
x 
layer, it was possible to obtain the tunneling selectivity which allows electron transmission from Si to n
+
-poly-Si layer while holes are repelled. The ideal thickness of tunnel oxide (1â€“2 nm) is advantage for capturing the photo-generated current of the solar cell. This structure can provide low recombination current density (J

) and low contact resistivity (
