as shown in Table 3. One is SiO
x
/a-Si layer without any process (abbreviated as Poly-unannealed), the second is SiO
x
/a-Si layer after annealing without phosphorus doping (abbreviated as Poly-annealed), and the last is SiO
x
/a-Si layer after annealing with phosphorus doping (abbreviated as n
+
-poly-Si). All of them were passivated by SiN
x 
layer and then tested for iV
oc 
before and after sintering. The iV
oc 
values of the n-TOPCon cells were measured using the quasi steady-state photocon
