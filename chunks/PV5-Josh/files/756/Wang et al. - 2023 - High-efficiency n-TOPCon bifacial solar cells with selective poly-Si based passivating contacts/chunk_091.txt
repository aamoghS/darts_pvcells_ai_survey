oc 
of approximately 0.3 mV, which can be negligible. While R
s 
decreased, FF did not show any advantage, which may be owing to the influence of the high resistance of the n
+
-poly-Si layer. However, in the best cell, R
s 
slightly increased, and FF also slightly increased which may be owing to the influence of the bulk time of Si wafer. The overall median ef
