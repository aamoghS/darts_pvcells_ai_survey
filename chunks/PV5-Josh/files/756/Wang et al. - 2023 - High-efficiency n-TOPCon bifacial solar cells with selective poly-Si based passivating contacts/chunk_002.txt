ion Secondary LPCVD/Phosphorus diffusion 
ABSTRACT  
Improving the conversion efficiency of n-TOPCon solar cell is still a hot topic. The selective poly-Si based passivating contacts (Poly-SEs) are ideal candidates for reducing the parasitic absorption and contact resistivity of n-type silicon solar cells and for providing better current collection. In this work, we used LPCVD and the POCl
