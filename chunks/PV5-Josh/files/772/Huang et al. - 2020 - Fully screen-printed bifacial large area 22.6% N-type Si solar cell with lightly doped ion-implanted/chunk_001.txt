 Implanted B emitter Large area Bifacial cell 
ABSTRACT  
We report on the fabrication of fully screen-printed bifacial large area (239 cm
2
) high-efficiency n-type Si solar cells with ion-implanted homogeneous boron emitter on the front side and carrier-selective tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) on the rear. Our phosphorus-doped poly-Si/SiO
x 
passivated contact with SiN
x 
capping layer gave excellent surface passivation with a very low recombination current density (J
