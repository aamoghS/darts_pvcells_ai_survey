front boron (B) emitter and rear n-TOPCon. A co-firing process was used to make screen-printed contacts to lightly doped B emitter and n-TOPCon simultaneously. The benefit of floating busbars was also quantitatively examined for the lightly doped implanted homogeneous B emitter by modeling, fabrication, and characterization of cells with five floating as well as fire-through busbars. 2.Experimental Fig. 1 shows the process flow and structure of the large-area (239 cm
