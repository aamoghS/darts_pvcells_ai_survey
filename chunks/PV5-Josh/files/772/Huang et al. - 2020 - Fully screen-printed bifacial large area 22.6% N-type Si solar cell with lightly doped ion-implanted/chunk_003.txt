prior to metallization. The industrial screen-printed, fire- through contacts with floating busbars on this boron emitter gave metallized emitter recombination current density of ~31 fA/cm

. This resulted in a low-cost industrial screen-printed n-type bifacial Si solar cell with 22.6% efficiency and 702 mV open-circuit voltage (V
