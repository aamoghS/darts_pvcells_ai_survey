 is regulated and controlled by P
RF 
(100 W, 300 W, 600 W). This P
RF 
parameter was chosen as a variable because it greatly affects the dissociation rate of reactive gases and bombardment kinetic energy of reactive ions, thus impacting the morphology and size [27,28]. The chemical etching mechanisms of this RIE system are explained by Equations (1)â€“(3) [24, 29,30]: Si+4F
