of 100 W, 300 W and 600 W, respectively, as well as the corresponding zoom-in SEM images of top view and cross-section view at 30.0 K magnifications. Compared with conventional micron-pyramid texture, the NPP structures reveal a hierarchical surface consisting of dense nanopores on top of random micron-pyramids and
