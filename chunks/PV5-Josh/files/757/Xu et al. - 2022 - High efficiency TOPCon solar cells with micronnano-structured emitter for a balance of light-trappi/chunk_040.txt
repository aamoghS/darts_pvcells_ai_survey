duction lies in severe Auger recombination and surface Shockley-Read- Hall (SRH) recombination of photo-generated carriers, caused by high surface doping concentration (N

of nano-structured surfaces, respectively. In order to suppress Auger recombination, the doping characteristics of NPP emitter based on the P

of 100 W were investigated and discussed
