1.Introduction Over the past few years, the industrial-level bifacial tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells have demonstrated an impressive development speed, with photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 24.5% [1]. Moreover, TOPCon solar cells allow a compatibility with mainstream passivated emitter and rear solar c
