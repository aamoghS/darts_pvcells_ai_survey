trical parameters of NPP cells are summed up in Table 2, together with conventional cells. The average V
oc 
of NPP cell at the P
RF 
of 600 W is more than 1â€“2 mV higher than those at the P
RF 
of 100 W and 300 W, which reveals passivation gains from larger feature sizes and smoother surface. The average J
sc 
of all NPP cells is greater than 41.43 mA/cm
2
, almost 2.8 mA/cm
2 
higher than that of conventional cells (41.15 mA/cm
2
), demonstrating the strong light-trapping capability of NPP st
