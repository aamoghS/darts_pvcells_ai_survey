ing to the SEM image luminance contrast shown in Fig. 2, it is obvious that nanogrooves are deeper and broader than nanopores because the V- shaped intersections between micron-pyramids were subjected to more physical sputtering and chemical etching. Fig. 2 gives clear evidence for different feature sizes under three P
