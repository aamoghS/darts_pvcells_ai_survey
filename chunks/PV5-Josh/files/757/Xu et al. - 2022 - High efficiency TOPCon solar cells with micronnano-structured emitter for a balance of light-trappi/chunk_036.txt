rable to or smaller than the incident light wavelength, especially the short-wavelength. The EML effectively enhances light scattering [33], and improves short-wavelength response of silicon wafers in the spectral range of 300â€“400 nm as shown in Fig. 3a. Meanwhile, the absorptance spectra of NPP structures show a redshift com
