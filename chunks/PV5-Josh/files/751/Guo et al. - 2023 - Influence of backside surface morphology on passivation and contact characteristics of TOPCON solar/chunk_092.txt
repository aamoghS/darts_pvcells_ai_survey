metal contact. Therefore, the contradiction between passivation and contact is better balanced, and the highest efficiency can be achieved. 4.Conclusion In summary, by finely controlling the etching process, the effects of different chemical etching methods and weight loss on the surface morphology, tunnel oxide/n +polysilicon passivation characteristics, and contact resistance were studied. Studies have shown that for textured surfaces, increasing the roundness of the pyramids (acid pol
