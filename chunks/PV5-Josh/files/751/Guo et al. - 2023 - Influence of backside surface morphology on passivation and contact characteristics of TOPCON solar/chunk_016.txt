, but it is necessary to strictly control the polishing process to obtain an ideal pyramid base size to reduce the impact on ohmic contact [6]. In order to obtain higher efficiencies for industrially fabricated TOPCon solar cells, optimization of the backside topography is necessary. However, the differences in passivation char

acteristics and contact characteristics between different wet etching processes and different conditions of the same etching process have not been carefully studied. Re
