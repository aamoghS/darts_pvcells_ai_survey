sistance are consistent with each other. Additionally, in the transport path of electrons between silicon and metal, the current flowing directly through the silver crystallites to the silver grid lines is the most influential transport mode. These direct contacts are mainly concentrated at the tips of the silicon pyramids, as there is no glass covering in this area [34]. The presence of pyramid tips in the textured structure increases direct transport and thus reduces contact resistivity. With
