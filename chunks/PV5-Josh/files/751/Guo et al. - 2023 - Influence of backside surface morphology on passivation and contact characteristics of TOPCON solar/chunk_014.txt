mance, contact performance and minimal parasitic absorption of the back tunnel oxide/N +polysilicon layer are the keys to achieve high efficiency. All three are affected by the topography of the rear surface. Some etching-related research has been done and promoted the further improvement of solar cell efficiency. Inline process using HNO
