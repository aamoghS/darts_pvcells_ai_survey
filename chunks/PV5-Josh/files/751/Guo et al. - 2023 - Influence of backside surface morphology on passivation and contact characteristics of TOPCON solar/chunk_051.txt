y, which can partly explain the differences in the quality and passivation performance of the tunneling oxide layer in samples with different topography. The P tailing doping concentration in single crystal silicon is specially extracted, as shown in Fig. 6(c), where depth =0 is the tunnel oxide layer/single crystal silicon interface.Inside the c-Si substrate, due to the blocking effect of the oxide layer on the diffusion of P atoms, the doping concentration of the acid- polished and alkali-poli
