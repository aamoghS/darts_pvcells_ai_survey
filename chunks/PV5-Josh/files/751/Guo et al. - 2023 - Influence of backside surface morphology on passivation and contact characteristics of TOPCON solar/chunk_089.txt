surface escape loss to increase. Acid- polished samples are also effective in reducing near-infrared parasitic absorption loss, but slightly worse than alkali-polished samples. Other optical losses are mainly related to metal shading, front surface blue light absorption, and ARC reflection. This is a problem that needs to be solved in future research. The optimization of the front selective emitter, metal grid lines, and anti-reflection film will further promote the improvement of solar cell eff
