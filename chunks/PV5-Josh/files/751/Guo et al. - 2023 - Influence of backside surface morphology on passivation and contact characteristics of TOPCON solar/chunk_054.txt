amidal structure of the textured sample leads to inconsistent thicknesses of the tunneling oxide layer at different positions of the pyramid, resulting in the cracking of the thinner oxide layer in some areas during high-temperature annealing. Typically, the SiOx thickness at the top, edges, and faces of the pyramids is thicker than that near the pyramid valleys. Since the passivation properties from n +polysilicon/ SiOx contacts are dependent on the thickness of SiOx, the increased roundness of
