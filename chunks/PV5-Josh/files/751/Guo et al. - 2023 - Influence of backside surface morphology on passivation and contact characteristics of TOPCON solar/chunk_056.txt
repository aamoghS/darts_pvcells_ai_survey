 concentration of the material will significantly affect the Auger recombination. For the P-doping concen

tration distribution in Fig. 6(c), we tried to use EDNA2 to simulate to estimate J
0, Auger 
in the c-Si substrate, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 (d). By properly setting the simulation parameters, the relative value of J
0, Auger 
can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(d). In the textured samples, J
0, Auger 
is the largest, reaching 8.78fA/cm
