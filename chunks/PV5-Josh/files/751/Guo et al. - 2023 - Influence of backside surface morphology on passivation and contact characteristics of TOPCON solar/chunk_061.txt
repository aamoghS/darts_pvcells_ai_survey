, which may be related to the formation of more silver crystallites due to the existence of the pyramid tip. Both acid polishing and alkali polishing can significantly reduce J
0, metal
, but under the same polishing weight loss, the J
0, metal 
of acid polishing samples is always greater than that of alkali polishing samples. The likely reasons are that the flat surface allows for th
