O/Ar gas mixture are used to deposit ultra-thin silicon oxide (SiO
x
) layer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), which is used as the tunneling oxide layer in the TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contacts) structure. It is found that the N
2
O/Ar flow ratios strongly affect the properties of SiO
x 
layer, such as deposition rate, the resistance of high temperature, passivation quality, etc., thus significantly affect the properties of polysilicon passivated contact structures an
