m were used for the preparation of solar cell samples.The flow chart of experimental details was shown in Fig. 1. After a saw damage removal step, all samples were textured and then immersed in 10% KOH solution for alkaline polishing and cleaned by standard RCA solutions. The resulting polished wafer were used for SiO
