c defects. The SiO
x 
layer may also damaged during high-temperature annealing, resulting in a sharp decline in passivation quality. We attribute this behavior to the fact that the pinhole density of the SiO
x 
layer increases sharply or SiO
x 
film breaks at a higher annealing temperature, which leads to severe internal diffusion of phosphorus. As shown in Fig. 5(a), phosphorus atoms penetrate SiO
x 
and diffuse into the silicon substrate in large numbers, resulting in the increase of potential
