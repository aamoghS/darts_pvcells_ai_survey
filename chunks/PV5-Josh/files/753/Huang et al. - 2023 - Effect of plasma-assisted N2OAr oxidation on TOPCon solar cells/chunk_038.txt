O/Ar reaches to 5:2, the dissociation of N

O is basically completed and the concentration of O atom reaches the maximum value. Meanwhile, the intensity of atomic O emission line reaches the maximum. Further increase of Ar flow can not increase the atomic O yield, but it will dilute the process gases and lead to the decrease of atomic O concent
