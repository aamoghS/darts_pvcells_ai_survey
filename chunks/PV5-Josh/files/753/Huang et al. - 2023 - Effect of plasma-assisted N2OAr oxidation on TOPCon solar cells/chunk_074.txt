uted to the increase of open circuit voltage (V
oc
) and filling factor (FF), which reach to 0.7092 V and 84.45, respectively. The increase of V
oc 
and FF is mainly related to the improvement of passivation quality and the decrease of contact resistivity, as described in Section 3.3. In addition, under the condition of N
2
O/Ar=5:2, we also obtain the champion efficiency of 25.06%. The specific electrical parameters are V

=0.7132 V, I

=13.7239 A, FF=84.55, as shown in Fig. 8.
