e quality and chemical composition of this ultra-thin tunneling SiO

layer can be controlled and optimized by introducing Ar and other inert gases into the process of plasma-assisted N

O oxidation, thus helping us to improve their electrical properties. In this paper, we present an ultra-thin tunneling SiO

tion method, which introduced Ar into N

O and use plasma-assisted N

O/Ar oxidation (PANAO) method to prepare ultra-thin tunneling SiO
