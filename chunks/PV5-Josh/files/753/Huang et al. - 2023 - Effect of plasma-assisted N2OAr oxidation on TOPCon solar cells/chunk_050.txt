rus atoms. We believe that more pinholes are generated in the PANAO SiO

layer and a large degree of film break-up has occurred at this temperature, similar to the break-up phenomenon observed in chemical silicon oxide [45], resulting in the ECV doping profiles at 940

and diffuse into silicon substrate in large quantities, leading to the increase of recombination center in silicon substrate, finally resulting in a sharp
