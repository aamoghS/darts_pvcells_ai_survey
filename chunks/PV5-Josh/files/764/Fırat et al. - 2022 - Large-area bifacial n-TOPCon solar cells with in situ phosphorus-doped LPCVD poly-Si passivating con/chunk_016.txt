to an increase of the time required for the deposition of a typical 150 nm thick Si film by only ~17 min, from ~15 min for the growth of intrinsic poly-Si to ~32 min in case of in situ doping [26]. Moreover, by combining the poly-Si films developed in our previous work with thermally grown interfacial SiO

layers and applying post-LPCVD annealing, excellent passivating contacts were fabricated with J
