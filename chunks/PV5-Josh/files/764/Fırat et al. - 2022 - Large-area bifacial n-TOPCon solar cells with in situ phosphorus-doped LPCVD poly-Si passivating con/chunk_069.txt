of the solar cells, which is attributed to issues during the screen-printing process mainly due to the use of aged Ag paste, resulting in quite regularly spaced finger interruptions at intervals of a few 100 nm as shown by the microscopy image in Fig. 4b). Poor quality of the metallization being the limiting factor for the FF is also demonstrated by the perfor
