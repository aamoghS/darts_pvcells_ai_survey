(DARC) and to further reduce the front reflectance [32,33]. The solar cells of both experiments were characterized by current- voltage (I–V) measurements under 1 sun illumination with the AM1.5 G spectrum using a Wacom solar simulator and a GridTouch system by Pasan to contact the zero-busbar devices. These measurements were performed both with front and rear illumination. In case of the solar cells with a DARC, I–V measurements were repeated after the realization of the DARC, and the best s
