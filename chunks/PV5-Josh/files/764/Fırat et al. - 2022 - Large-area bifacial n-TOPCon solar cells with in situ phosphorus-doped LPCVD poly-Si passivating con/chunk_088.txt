ing experiment, depicted in Fig. 7c), has lower PL counts i.e., darker regions at the edges. This is attributed to unexpected contamination of the edges, found to be originating from the boat of the PECVD equipment used. By contrast, the darker color in the metallized regions is expected due to elevated recombination because of metallization, which clearly increases with higher MF in Fig. 7b) and 7c). Table 4 also reveals that the flatter rear surface morphology resulting from polishing allows t
