3.1.Impact of poly-Si film thickness on n-TOPCon solar cells Figures of merit of the n-TOPCon solar cells with semi-textured rear surface morphology and varying t
poly 
are summarized in Table 3. While the best solar cell has an 
 
of 22.4% along with a relatively high FF of 81.1%, this seems to be an outlier as the best average 
 
lies just below 22%, accompanied by significantly lower average FF values of 79.4% and below. Comparison of the average 
 
as a function of t
poly 
shows that sola
