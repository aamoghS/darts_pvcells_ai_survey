is increased from 100 to 150 nm, showing that passivating contacts with thicker poly-Si films preserve their carrier selectivity better against aggressive screen-printed metallization. This observation agrees with the findings of similar studies in the literature [14,15,41â€“43]. Moreover, according to Fig. 5a), J
