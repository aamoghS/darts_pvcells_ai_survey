g the factors limiting the performance of the n- TOPCon solar cells, symmetrically passivated monitor samples were also prepared together with the devices. These rear and front monitors, depicted schematically in Fig. 2a) and 2b), respectively, were designed to reproduce either the rear or the front side of the devices, allowing the passivation and contact properties of each surface to be independently investigated. As the rear surface design was varied during the experi
