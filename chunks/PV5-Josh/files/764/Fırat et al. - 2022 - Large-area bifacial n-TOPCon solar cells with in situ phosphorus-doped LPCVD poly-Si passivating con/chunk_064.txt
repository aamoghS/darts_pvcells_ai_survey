per 50 nm increase in t
poly 
[26,38]. Studies by other groups in the literature also predict similar FCA-related losses between 0.1 and 0.25 mA/cm
2 
per 50 nm increase in t
poly 
[12,15, 39]. Hence, the behavior of J
sc 
in Table 3 as a function of t
poly 
can be explained with the parasitic absorption losses reported in the literature. To verify this hypothesis, R and EQE measurements were performed, yi
