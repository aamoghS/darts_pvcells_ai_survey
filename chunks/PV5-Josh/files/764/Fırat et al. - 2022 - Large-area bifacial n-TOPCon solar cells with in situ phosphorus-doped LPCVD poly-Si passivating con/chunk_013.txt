lternative approach for the fabrication of poly-Si films based on LPCVD and in situ P-doping, various studies are present in the literature, which provide valuable insights into the impact of LPCVD process parameters on structural and electrical properties of poly-Si films [17â€“22]. Nevertheless, the applications considered in these studies are mainly not associated with PV. In fact, the number of publications on the fabrication of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly
