 A further gain in J
sc 
by 0.5 mA/cm

was then obtained by applying a double ARC to the front surface of the devices, in the form of an additional SiO
x 
layer on top of the SiN
x 
layer, which resulted in a broadband reduction in R. This resulted in 
 
being higher by 0.2% on average, and the best solar cell had a certified 
 
of 23.01%, accompanied by a high V
oc 
of 691.7 mV, and a high J
sc 
of 40.95 mA/cm

. The fabricated n-TOPCon solar cells were also incorporated in 1-cell laminate
