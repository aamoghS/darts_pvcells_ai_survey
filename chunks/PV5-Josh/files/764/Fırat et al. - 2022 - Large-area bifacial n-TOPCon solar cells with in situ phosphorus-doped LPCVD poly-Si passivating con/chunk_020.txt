f this work. This paper reports on the integration of passivating contacts based on in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD at the rear side of large-area bifacial n-TOPCon solar cells. The devices were fabricated relying on industrial methods, using a homogeneous boron-diffused front emitter and screen-printed metallization. Impact of t

on the passivating contact and the solar cell properties is presented. Moreover, perfor
