Further improvement of the solar cell design was achieved by real

izing a flatter, polished rear surface for the devices, resulting in an average 
 
of 22.4%. This was found to be mainly due to improved light trapping at the rear side, increasing J

by 0.5 mA/cm

. The electrical performance of the passivating contact also improved on the polished surface, yielding J
