uration. In the more conventional glass-backsheet configuration, PV modules are known to be more susceptible to failure, particularly during the damp heat test, due to moisture ingress through the backsheet [46]. Hence, for assessing the suitability of the developed solar cells for application in glass-backsheet modules, the applied tests are to be repeated using the glass-backsheet configuration. Furthermore, for
