TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films has been limited due to challenges arising from combining LPCVD with in situ P-doping, which has made ex situ doping the preference of the PV industry so far [23â€“25]. The main challenge is to achieve a high active doping level (N
D, act
) in the deposited Si film, which is needed for obtaining low J

, together with a high deposition rate (r
