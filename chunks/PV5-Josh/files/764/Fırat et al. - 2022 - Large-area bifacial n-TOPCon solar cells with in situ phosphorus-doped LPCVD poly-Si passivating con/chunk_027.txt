e monitors had been annealed by the same process as the solar cells prior to the TEM measurements. Following the oxidation, the in situ P-doped poly-Si film was deposited by LPCVD in a single-wafer ASM Epsilon 2000 reactor, using the process reported in Ref. [26]. The split of the t
poly 
screening experiment was introduced at this step by varying the deposition duration, which resulted in three different t
poly 
values: 100 nm, 150 nm, and 200 nm. For each one of these thicknesses, a group of 8
