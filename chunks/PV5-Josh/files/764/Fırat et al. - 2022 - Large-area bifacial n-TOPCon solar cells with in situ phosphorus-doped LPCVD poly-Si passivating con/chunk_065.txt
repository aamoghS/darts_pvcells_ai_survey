othesis, R and EQE measurements were performed, yielding the results in Fig. 3. The plot on the left shows that the solar cells with different t
poly 
have very similar optical properties at short and visible wavelengths, while R seems to decrease with increasing t
poly 
at long wavelengths, attributed to increased absorption in the poly-Si at the solar cell rear. The impact of higher t
poly 
on EQE and thus on J
sc 
is more clearly seen in the second, zoomed-in plot, which indicates a clear dro
