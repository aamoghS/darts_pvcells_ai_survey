itu doped poly-Si films. 1-cell glass-glass laminates were also fabricated with the developed solar cells, which showed no loss in their power output both upon 400 thermal cycles and after 1000 h of damp heat testing. Lastly, a roadmap is presented, indicating strategies to achieve efficiencies up to 25.5% with n-TOPCon solar cells incorporating the in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films.   
1.Introduction In recent years, n-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (n-TOPCon) solar cells have found inc
