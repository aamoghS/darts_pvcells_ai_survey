=25.5%. 5.Summary and outlook Realizing in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD offers the prospect of simplifying the manufacturing of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells, by eliminating the need for an external doping process, prevalent in the industry today. In this work, the potential of in situ P-doped LPCVD poly- Si films was demonstrated at solar cell and laminate level, by integrating them in passivating contacts at the rear side of large-area bifacial n- TOPCon devices
