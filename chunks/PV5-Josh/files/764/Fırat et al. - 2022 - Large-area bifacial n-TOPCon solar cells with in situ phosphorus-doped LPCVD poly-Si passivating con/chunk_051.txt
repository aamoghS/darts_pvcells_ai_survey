loss ≤5% for a single IEC61215 test. 2.3.Roadmap for improving the n-TOPCon solar cells To establish a roadmap indicating experimental strategies to improve the efficiency of the n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD-based poly-Si passivating contacts, simulations were performed using the Quokka 2 software [37]. First, a model was built to match the I–V parameters of t
