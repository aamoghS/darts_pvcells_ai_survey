st, the 1% relative increase in P

originates mainly from an increase in J

, from 38.7 mA/cm

to 39 mA/ cm

. This improvement in J
sc 
is not well-understood. For the thermal cycling, the evolution of P
out 
clearly follows the FF of the laminate, as depicted in Fig. 12b). Other Iâ€“V parameters were found to remain un
