surements on identically processed thickness monitors. As for the oxide thickness monitors, the t
poly 
monitors had also undergone the same annealing process as the solar cells before the thickness measurements. As the LPCVD process creates a wrap-around of poly-Si at the front surface, this parasitic layer was removed by a sin
