s. This finding agrees with the results of similar recombination loss analyses reported in the literature for n-TOPCon solar cells [5,16]. Overall, these results show that a thick enough poly-Si film with t
poly 
â‰¥150 nm is necessary to achieve high-quality passivating contacts and high-efficiency n-TOPCon solar cells for the screen-printed contacts used. While choosing t
