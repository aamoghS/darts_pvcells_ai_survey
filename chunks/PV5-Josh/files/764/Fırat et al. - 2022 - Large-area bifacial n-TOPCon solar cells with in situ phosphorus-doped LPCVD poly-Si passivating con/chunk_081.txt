. Therefore, new bottles of screen-printing pastes and new screens adapted to the wafer size were used for the rear surface morphology screening experiment. 3.2.Impact of rear surface morphology on n-TOPCon solar cells For studying the impact of the rear surface morphology on the solar cell characteristics, n-TOPCon solar cells with semi-textured and pol
