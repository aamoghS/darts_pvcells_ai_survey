g the entire solar cell. This could potentially be achieved by applying a full-area p-type poly-Si passivating contact to the front surface and thinning down the poly-Si film between the contact fingers to obtain low thicknesses and mitigate parasitic absorption losses [49,50]. For the transparent passivating contact, a J
