 after the realization of the DARC, and the best solar cell was also sent to ISFH CalTeC for a calibrated I–V measurement. From the I–V measurements with front illumination, the open circuit voltage (V
oc
), the short circuit current density (J
sc
), the fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (

) of the solar cells were extracted. Moreover, the 
 
values obtained with front and rear illumination were used for determining the bifaciality of the solar cells as the ratio of th
