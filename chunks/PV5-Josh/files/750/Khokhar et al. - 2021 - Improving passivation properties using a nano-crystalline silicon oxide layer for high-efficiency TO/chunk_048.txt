ant to control the properties and stoichiometry of the tunnel oxide layer. The FGA treatment on the phosphorus-doped nc-SiO
x 
layer increased hydrogen activation on both sides of the nc-SiO
x 
layer as well as of the tunnel oxide interface. This treatment permitted the best passivation at 50 nm thick phosphorus-doped nc-SiO
x 
layer. FGA led to a minimal J
o 
value, showing that this structure would produce a higher- efficiency TOPCon cell. Fig. 6(a) shows improvements in
