bject of significant research attention owing to its environmentally friendly, globally consented, and renewable characteristics. Crystalline silicon (c- Si) is commonly used to fabricate solar cells because of its abundance in nature, low cost, and excellent performance. Presently, above 95% of overall photovoltaic production is shared by c-Si solar [1]. To further enhance the conversion efficiency of c-Si solar cells, the minority charge- carrier recombination losses at the interfaces between
