hich can assist the fabrication of TOPCon solar cells. nc- SiO
x 
with a thickness of 50 nm exhibited lower sheet resistivity as well as beneficial metal contact. Moreover, the T
PDA 
was diminished to mitigate high-temperature damage and achieve reduced costs. As per AFORST Het simulation results by using nc-SiO
x 
for TOPCon structure, we got V

of 761.5 mV, J
