in Fig. 4. Investigation of the oxidation states was executed by deconvolution of the silicon 2p peak. It is known as a rule of thumb that the peak shifts 1 eV per oxidation state. The exact parameters were taken from Ref. 37 (Si
1+
: 0.9 eV, Si
2+
: 1.7 eV, Si
3+
: 2.7 eV, Si
4+
: 3.7 eV). The deconvolution of the peak revealed the presence of silicon suboxides in the material. The observed evolution of the Si
