parency. By employing the nc-SiO
x 
layer, effective surface passivation, carrier selectivity, electrical properties and optical transmission can be used to improve, all are vitally important in devise operation. We optimized the deposited nc-SiO
x 
layer on an ultra-thin (~1.5 nm) silicon dioxide (SiO
2
) tunnel oxide layer to improve recombination current density and carrier lifetime. The passivation characteristics were improved by varying the ann
