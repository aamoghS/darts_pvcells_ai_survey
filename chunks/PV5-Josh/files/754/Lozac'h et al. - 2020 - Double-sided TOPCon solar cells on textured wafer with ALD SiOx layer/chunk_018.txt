), are measured on symmetric structures and non-symmetric structures on polished and textured c-Si surfaces. The passivation is characterized at room temperature by using the quasi-steady-state photoconductance method (QSSPC, Sinton WTC-120) [31]. The passivation property is evaluated by the effective lifetime of minority carriers at an in
