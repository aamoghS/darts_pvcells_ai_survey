 deposition (PECVD) system in a down-flow configuration for the deposition of a-Si:H precursor films. Here, the p-type precursor film is composed of the (p)/(i) a-Si:H stack, where the boron concentration in (p) a-Si:H layer is varied. This (p)/(i) a-Si:H stack allows us to control the dopant concentration and distribution after the high-T annealing, as described in the next section. For the n-type poly-Si precursor, the phosphorous doped (n) a-Si:H is used without (i) a-Si:H layer. The p- and n
