flow lower than 50 sccm, the PCE decreases due to a voltage loss in V

, pV

, and iV
oc
. The pV
oc 
is consistently slightly lower than the iV
oc
, likely due to the additional passivation losses induced by the ITO and Ag sputtering processes required to finish the cell fabrication [37], and the measured V
oc 
of finished cells is lower than the pV
oc 
due to the series resis
