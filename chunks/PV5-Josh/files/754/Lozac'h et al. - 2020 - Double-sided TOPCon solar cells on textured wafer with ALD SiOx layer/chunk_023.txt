nce. The illuminated area, used for the measurement of the short-circuit current (J
sc
) and thus the photoconversion efficiency, is measured at 1.045 cm

, which includes the active area (1.017 cm

with the (p) poly-Si layer is measured by the transmission line method (TLM) on a specific front line patterned beside the solar cells from the same c-Si wafer. 3.Experimental results 3.1.Conformal coverage by ALD The transmissio
