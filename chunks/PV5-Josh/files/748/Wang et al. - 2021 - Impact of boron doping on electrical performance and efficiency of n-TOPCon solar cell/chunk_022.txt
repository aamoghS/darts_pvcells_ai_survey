. However, the same requirements for B-doped emitters are to obtain a low emitter dark saturation current density (J
0e, passivated
), resulting in obtaining a high open-circuit voltage (V
oc
). For achieving this, the front-side heavily B-doped p
+
layer should be lightly doped with a low peak concentration and a shallow junction. Meanwhile, a low specific contact resistance (

) must be ensured for screen-printed metallization along with the high surface concentration of B-doped p
+
layer (
