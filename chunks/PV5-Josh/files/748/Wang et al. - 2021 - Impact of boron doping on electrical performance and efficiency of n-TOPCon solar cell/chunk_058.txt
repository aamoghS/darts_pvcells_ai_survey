0e, passivated 
changed in the same direction because of the large surface and bulk recombination, which has a higher doping density due to lowered minority mobility. To reduce J
0e, passivated
, the B-doped profiles should have a low dopant concentration and a shallow junction. A firing-through Ag/Al paste was used to
