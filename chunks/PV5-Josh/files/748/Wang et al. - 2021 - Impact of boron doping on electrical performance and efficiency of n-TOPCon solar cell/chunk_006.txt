- poly-Si is fabricated through the following process (Polzin et al., 2018): (i) Growth of an interfacial oxide layer; (ii) Deposition of a doped amorphous Si layer (or a-Si layer); (iii) Recrystallization of the doped a- Si layer. Previous studies have reported the emitter recombination current of n

-poly-Si had a low density of approximately ~ 1.4 fA/cm
