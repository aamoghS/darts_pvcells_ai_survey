In 
one 
experiment, 
the 
deposition 
time 
was 
varied 
to 
obtain 
several 
thicknesses 
of 
poly-Si 
films. 
From 
correlating 
thickness 
with 
deposition 
time 
in 
Fig.

(c), 
we 
obtained 
a 
deposition 
rate 
on 
polished 
and 
textured 
silicon 
wafers 
of 
about 
3.3 
nm/min 
and 
about 
3.1 
nm/min. 
The 
as-deposited 
intrinsic 
poly-Si 
is 
subsequently 
doped
