cells. 
The 
cell 
structure 
is 
illustrated 
in 
Fig.

. 
It 
features 
a 
front 
boron 
emitter 
and 
a 
rear 
passivating 
contact, 
with 
screen-printed 
fingers 
on 
both 
sides 
to 
obtain 
bifaciality. 
The 
phosphorus-doped 
wa
-
fers 
contain 
only 
low 
amounts 
of 
oxygen, 
with 
a 
resistivity 
range 
of 
about 
0.5
