Processing 
poly-Si 
thin 
films 
by 
LPCVD 
is 
well 
established 
in 
the 
semiconductor 
industry 
[

]. 
We 
use 
an 
industrial 
LPCVD 
system 
with 
a 
capacity 
of 
1200 
wafers 
per 
load. 
Silane 
is 
used 
as 
the 
gas 
source. 
The 
thicknesses 
of 
the 
as-deposited 
poly-Si 
films 
are 
measured 
with 
a 
scanning 
electronic 
microscope 
(SEM) 
as 
shown 
in
