	abstract = {Silicon heterojunction solar cells use crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers as optical absorbers and employ bilayers of doped/intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) to form passivating contacts. Recently, we demonstrated that such solar cells increase their operating voltages and thus their conversion eﬃciencies during light exposure. We found that this performance increase is due to improved passivation of the a-Si:H/c-Si interface and is induced by injected charge carriers (either by light soaking or forward-voltage biasing of the device). Here, we discuss this counterintuitive behavior and establish that: (i) the performance increase is observed in solar cells as well as modules; (ii) this phenomenon requires the presence of doped a-Si:H ﬁlms, but is independent from whether light is incident from the a-Si:H(p) or the a-Si:H(n) side; (iii) {UV} and blue photons do not play a role in this eﬀect; (iv) the performance increase can be observed under illumination intensities as low as 20 W m−1 (0.02-sun) and appears to be almost identical in strength when under 1-sun (1000 W m−1); (v) the underlying physical mechanism likely diﬀers from annealing-induced surface passivation.},

Simulations were performed under various device material parameters and back contact geometry conﬁgurations in order to optimize bifacial solar cell performance under diﬀerent simulated illumination conditions. Bifacial device maximum power output was also compared with the monofacial equivalent one and the industrial standard Al-{BSF} structure. The performance of the bifacial structure during highly diﬀused irradiance conditions commonly observed in the Middle East region due to high concentrations of airborne dust particles was also investigated. Simulation results demonstrated that such conditions are highly favorable for the bifacial device because of the signiﬁcantly increased diﬀuse component of the solar radiation which enters the back cell surface.},

In the second part of this review, we focus on the future developments in the ﬁeld of c-Si solar cells based on carrier-selective passivation layers. Whereas the dielectric layers are insulating and are hence applied only for passivating the noncontacted areas of the silicon surface, the carrier-selective passivation layers are intended to provide an eﬀective passivation of non-contacted as well as contacted areas of a c-Si solar cell, thereby increasing the eﬃciency potential of c-Si solar cells signiﬁcantly. Due to the fact that the carrier-selective layers are implemented in a contact, besides the good passivation properties for minorities, these layers must also provide a good majority carrier transport, i.e. they have to provide a low contact resistance. Both properties, i.e. suppression of minoritycarrier recombination as well as good majority-carrier transport, deﬁne the selectivity of the carrier-selective contact, which is an important ﬁgure of merit for the assessment and comparison of diﬀerent types of carrierselective contacts. One very promising type of carrier-selective passivation layer is based on heavily doped polycrystalline silicon layers deposited on a thin silicon oxide layer, the latter providing the excellent passivation while enabling eﬃcient majority-carrier transport via pin-holes and/or tunneling. Moreover, we discuss metal oxides and conductive polymers, which have only recently been applied to c-Si photovoltaics, but seem to have a promising potential as low-cost selective contact materials. We ﬁnally compare combinations of the various options of carrier-selective layers concerning their combined selectivities and eﬃciency potentials.},

	abstract = {Potential induced degradation ({PID}) is a reliability issue affecting photovoltaic ({PV}) modules, mainly when {PV} strings operate under high voltages in hot/humid conditions. Polarization-type {PID} ({PID}-p) has been known to decrease module performance quickly. {PID}-p can be reduced or recovered under the light in some cases, but this effect, as expected, would be less pronounced on the rear side of bifacial {PV} modules receiving lower irradiance. As bifacial {PV} modules are projected to dominate the {PV} market within the next 10 years, it is crucial to understand the {PID}-p issue in bifacial modules better. In this study, we performed indoor {PID} testing to induce {PID}-p on 14 commercial bifacial p-{PERC} modules with three different module constructions from three manufacturers. Four rounds (+ve and −ve polarities for front and rear sides) of {PID} testing are done at 25°C, 54\% relative humidity ({RH}) for 168 h using the aluminum foil method. Each module side (front cell side and back cell side) is tested individually under both negative and positive voltage bias. The results show that the highest degradation of 32\% in maximum power (Pmax) at standard test conditions (1000 W/m2) and 51\% at low irradiance (200 W/m2) has been observed in some cases. Recovery under sunlight is also done, and outcomes show a near-complete recovery in Pmax. This study presents an extensive experimental methodology and a detailed analysis to systematically and simultaneously/sequentially evaluate multiple construction types of bifacial modules to the {PID}-p susceptibility and recovery.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for sustainable energy has drawn attention towards photovoltaic efficiency and reliability. In this context, the shading and associated hotpot degradation within {PV} modules has become an important area of research and development. The experimental approach of this paper aims to investigate single cell shading in high efficiency monocrystalline silicon {PV} {PERC} modules. Prior to the outdoor experiment, the {PV} module underwent experimental testing under {STC} to determine variation in electrical and thermal behaviour due to partial shading. The indoor experiments are performed using Sun-simulator and the I–V and P–V curves are analysed. Further, the outdoor experiments were performed under realistic conditions. In both cases, results showed that during 40–60\% shading in single cell leads to critical shading scenario causing significant drop in power output in comparison with their unshaded conditions. The maximum power loss of 36.34\% and 42\% is recorded for indoor and outdoor experiments. The outdoor experiments recorded hotspot temperature of 85–90.1 °C under respective 40\% and 60\% critical shading scenarios. The efficiency recorded in the time interval of 11:00:00 and 11:30:00 was highest for the solar radiations between 940 and 990 W/m2. The maximum drop in efficiency is recorded from noon till 13:30:00 time of the day. Development of hotspot is directly related to the failure or malfunction of protecting system. Hence the importance of type of {PV} technology, amount of shading, and critical shading scenario is presented in the study. This study is important for researcher and manufacture to consider single cell shading in {PV} technology.},

The passivation performance and contact resistivity are investigated as a function of the tunnel {SiO}2 thickness and annealing condition. We ﬁnd that the {SiO}2/a-Si:H stack provides excellent passivation to laser doped n þ regions, with corresponding low recombination current density (Jo) values. A lower level of surface passivation is achieved by the {SiO}2/a-Si:H stack on laser doped pþ regions. A postdeposition forming gas anneal ({FGA}) at 400 °C is found to improve the passivation performance to laser doped pþ regions and deteriorate the passivation to laser doped n þ regions. Acceptable contact resistivity (ρc) values have been obtained for both laser doped n þ and pþ regions after aluminum metallization and a post {FGA} to activate the alloying process between the a-Si:H and aluminum layer.

Most new photovoltaic manufacturing capacity added in the second half of 2014 was {PERC}-based, making {PERC} now the cell technology with second-highest production capacity, with the latest industry roadmap anticipating {PERC} will become the dominant commercial cell technology by 2020. The ﬁrst paper describing the {PERC} cell appeared in 1989, although the structure was conceived several years earlier. The attractive technical features were the reduction of rear surface recombination by a combination of dielectric surface passivation and reduced metal/semiconductor contact area while simultaneously increasing rear surface reﬂection by use of a dielectrically displaced rear metal reﬂector. The key issues in the development of this technology and its commercial implementation are described, including a review of recent adoption rates and the way these are likely to evolve in the future.},

We present an alternative picture, essentially based on a localized current ﬂow through the interfacial oxide, mediated either by local reduction of the oxide layer thickness or by pinholes. In consequence, the local current ﬂow implies transport limitations for both minority and majority carriers in the c-Si absorber, and thus a correlation between recombination current and series resistance. Thus, a poly-Si/c-Si junction can also be explained within the framework of a classical pn junction picture for a passivated, locally contacted emitter, e.g. by the model of Fischer. Both electron selective contacts (n þ poly-Si) and hole selective contacts (p þ poly-Si) can be described consistently when using reasonable input parameters. Especially for pþ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, our model could guideline further improvement.},

	abstract = {Biomass ash, especially, wood ash has a high degree of alkalinity. As the wood ash has an alkaline environment and similarities to zeolites structure, it may be used in the electrolysis process as a solid electrocatalyst to reduce or replace chemical catalysts. Design of Experiment and Statgraphics software were used for the research. The goal of the experiment was to analyze possibilities of ash use as an electrolyte component. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statgraphics statistical data analysis tool and the empirical models with correlation equations describing the {pH} value of analyzing samples. The results were validated using the effects of variables, the half-normal probability plot, Standardized Pareto chart, main effects plot for {pH} and estimated response surface for variables. The used validation methods show that there is strong correlation between {pH} value and used sample mixture in the experiment. Further research needed to prove the theory about possibilities of ash use as an electrolyte component.},

	abstract = {Since passivated emitter and rear cells ({PERC}) and other silicon solar cell concepts with evaporated aluminum (Al) as rear metallization are incompatible with a common solder process, in this work an annealing stable, solderable and long-term stable metallization scheme deposited by physical vapor deposition ({PVD}) is developed. The solder stack that complements the Al metallization consists of sputter deposited {TiN}/Ti/Ag or {TiN}/{NiV}/Ag, whereby the {TiN} layer serves as a diffusion barrier against Al. It is therefore optimized by varying sputter parameters and by stuffing the grain boundaries with oxygen. On the optimized stack a cell-interconnector can be conventionally soldered even after a strong annealing step of 15 min at 425°C, which sets this concept apart from other {PVD} metallization approaches. Cell efficiency is not influenced by the solder stack compared to a reference rear metallization by plain evaporated Al. Additionally, long-term stability of the solder-joints on the metallization scheme is investigated by thermal aging of solder-joints and thermal cycling of demo modules with {PERC} cells.},

The specific silanol group vibration peaks in {FT}-{IR} spectra confirm the mechanism of the blistering free surface formation. The blistering affects not only the appearance but also the implied Voc of the cells, that is to say, the quality of the passivation [10]. The hydrogen containing species (by-product of the {ALD} process) will bond to the {SiO}2 (both Si and O atom site) which grows after the thermal treatment with oxygen. Due to the good diffusivity within the {SiO}2 layer, the amount of hydrogen out-diffusing towards the {SiNX} {ARC} layer after firing can be reduced to achieve blistering free silicon solar cells.},

	abstract = {This study provides an overview of green supply chain management ({GSCM}) in the context of renewable energy sources. Thus, it establishes a green management standard with {GSCM} that companies can adopt. The environmental, economic, and social components determine the concept of {GSCM}. However, the development and commercialization of renewable energy and sustainable manufacturing practices play a fundamental role in shaping the traditional supply chain management ({SCM}) and business models. {GSCM} means that firms and organizations must balance economic and environmental performance to stay competitive, and conform with regulatory and community pressures. This has forced enterprises to design and implement strategies such as eco-efficiency, greener production, and cleaner environmental practices, for green management practices, which aim at reducing the environmental impacts of their operations. This study further highlights insights needed to significantly improve performance and overcome barriers to the development of renewable energy green supply chain management ({REGSCM}). It also presents useful techniques by outlining better control chain costs to make renewable energy more affordable and efficient, and a new conceptual model that is mainly grounded within the network of distributed energy systems in the context of {GSCM}. This concept allows renewable energy producers to sell their surplus electricity based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network or sell directly via the general market. Specifically, this model brings to bear the linkages to the creation of value by firms.},

Following this simulation based approach, we effectively improve the front side metallization and the emitter characteristics. Currently, our best prototype process has reached a conversion efficiency well over 21\% which enables the manufacturing of a 60-cell based module with a power of 310W. Our best cell so far has a conversion efficiency of 21.5\% which has been confirmed by the calibration laboratory of Fraunhofer {ISE}.

	abstract = {In photovoltaic ({PV}) modules, the interconnection of solar cells is critical in terms of mechanical stability and resistive power losses. In this study, we analyze the interconnection of largearea 15.6 × 15.6 cm2 industrial p-type passivated emitter and rear cell ({PERC}) solar cells in terms of resistive losses. For our analysis, we prepare a 3 × 3 minimodule from {PERC} solar cells with soldering pads and efﬁciencies up to 20.0\%. We measure a signiﬁcant cell-to-module ({CTM}) power loss of 8\% at this module. For comparison, we prepare a 3 × 6 module consisting of halved 7.8 × 15.6 cm2 {PERC} solar cells. Using a nanosecond laser to cut the ﬁnished solar cell in two pieces, no additional power loss is introduced by cutting. The {CTM} factor of 1.0 determined at the 3 × 6 module is explained using an analytical model describing the series resistance of the module interconnection. Using this model, we estimate for our current {PERC} cell generation and module process an output power of 275 W for 60 full-size cells and 285 W for 120 halved cells.},
