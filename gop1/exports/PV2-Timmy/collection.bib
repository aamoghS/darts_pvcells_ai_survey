	abstract = {Multicrystalline (mc) n-type silicon has proven to be a suitable substrate for the fabrication of highly eﬃcient mc-Si solar cells. In this paper, we elaborate the impact of base material parameters on the eﬃciency potential of n-type mc-Si solar cells featuring a boron-diﬀused front side emitter and a full-area passivating rear contact ({TOPCon}). The electrical material quality can be signiﬁcantly improved by replacing the standard crystallization process with a seed-assisted growth for crystallization of high-performance ({HP}) mc silicon. Using high-purity quartz crucibles or larger crucibles in combination with an optimization of the grain boundary area fraction with an adapted seed structure leads to further improvements of the material quality in terms of charge carrier lifetimes. However, not only the charge carrier lifetime, but also the base resistivity is of crucial importance for the eﬃciency potential depending on the cell concept. Based on experimental data and simulations, we assess the optimal range for the base resistivity and the wafer thickness for n-type mc-Si {TOPCon} solar cells. With the optimal material parameters, an “eﬃciency limiting bulk recombination analysis” ({ELBA}) reveals an eﬃciency potential in the range of 22.5\% for n-type mc-Si {TOPCon} solar cells. Finally, we fabricated {TOPCon} solar cells based on optimized n-type {HP} mc-Si substrate and demonstrate a certiﬁed eﬃciency of 21.9\%, which is the highest eﬃciency reported for multicrystalline silicon solar cells so far.},

	abstract = {The carrier transport through the silicon-oxide ({SiOx}) layer in tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) c-Si solar cells has been studied experimentally and by simulation. The current intensity versus voltage (J-V) characteristics of {GaIn}/n-c-Si/{SiOx}/n+-poly-Si/Al structures shows a linear Ohmic characteristic, while a non-Ohmic behavior is observed in the samples without the n+-poly-Si contact layer. Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-{AFM}) images reveal some current spikes on the surface of the samples, which could be related to the transport through pinholes. The simulation results show that 1) a rectiﬁcation characteristic is obtained when only the tunneling mechanism is included, 2) both the reverse saturation current and the forward current increase when a small amount of transport through pinholes is introduced, and 3) ﬁnally a linear Ohmic behavior is observed when the pinhole transport component reaches a certain level. Furthermore, the simulation for whole {TOPCon} solar cells provides some useful results. For very thin {SiOx} ({\textless} 1.2 nm), the tunneling provides suﬃcient high tunneling probability and high eﬃciency {TOPCon} solar cells can be obtained without transport through pinholes if the passivation is ensured; while for a relatively thick {SiOx} ({\textgreater} 1.2 nm) without the transport through pinholes, the {TOPCon} solar cell shows a poor ﬁll factor ({FF}) with a high series resistance (Rs) because the tunneling does not provide a suﬃcient high transport channel for carrier transport, and the introduction of a small number of transports through pinholes improves the {FF} and reduces the Rs, hence improves the {PCE}. However, a high possibility for carrier going through pinholes reduces all of the performance parameters and degrades {PCE} for all the cases simulated. Therefore, an optimized pinhole density and size distribution is critical engineering for solar cell performance optimization. However, the establishment of an optimized method to precisely control the pinhole formation and characterization is still on the way.},

	abstract = {We report an industrial compatible tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) structure on solar-grade p-type {cSi} wafer as the rear emitter for high-efficiency solar cells, where the ultrathin silicon oxide ({SiOx}) is made by plasma-assisted oxidation and the P-doped n-type poly-Si (n+-poly-Si) contact layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition ({PECVD}) of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with in-situ doping with {PH}3 and following the high-temperature annealing. The fabrication processes of {SiOx} and n+-poly-Si layers are systematically optimized. It is found that the optimized annealing temperature for the crystallization and dopant activation is in the range of 850 °C and 880 °C, which is higher than the similar structure with chemically oxidized {SiOx} (820 °C). In addition, the samples made with higher {PH}3/{SiH}4 doping ratio during the a-Si:H deposition need a lower annealing temperature to reach the similar dopant distribution within the samples made with lower doping ratio but annealed at higher temperature, it means that the optimized annealing temperature decreases with the increase of the {PH}3/{SiH}4 doping ratio during the deposition of a-Si:H precursor. The optimized process with post-hydrogenation yields excellent surface passivation on the p-type Si substrate with the implied opencircuit voltage ({iVoc}) of ∼742 {mV}, the single-side saturated recombination current density (J0) of ∼3.0 {fA}/cm2, the contact resistivity (ρc) of ∼2–4 {mΩ} cm2, and the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) of ∼1050 μs (Δn = 1 × 1015 cm-3). With these passivation parameters, a simulation study demonstrates the advantage of rear emitter over the conventional front emitter {TOPCon} solar cell with ∼22.8\% achievable efficiency on solar-grade p-type wafers with current industrial constraints, and ∼24.9\% on high quality p-type c-Si wafers with the optimized conditions in R\&D laboratories.

The surface P dopant concentration in the polycrystalline Si was higher than 1 � 1020 atom/cm3, resulted in a low series resistance and a high fill factor. The characterization and simulation results show that both metal shading loss and rear surface recombination were dominant among all of the losses.

The minority carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage reveals an ameliorated passivation property, which gives the motivation to run a simulation. The passivating contact of an ultra-thin silicon oxide (1.2 nm) capped with a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ({PECVD}) grown 30 nm thick nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-{SiOx}), provides outstanding passivation properties with low recombination current density (Jo) ({\textasciitilde}1.1 {fA}/cm2) at a 950 °C annealing temperature. The existence of a thin silicon oxide layer ({SiO}2) at the rear surface with superior quality (low pinhole density, Dph {\textless} 1 × 10−8 and low interface trap density, Dit ≈ 1 × 108 cm−2 {eV}−1), reduces the recombination of the carriers. The start of a small number of transports by pinholes improves the fill factor ({FF}) up to 83\%, reduces the series resistance (Rs) up to 0.5 Ω cm2, and also improves the power conversion efficiency ({PEC}) by up to 27.4\%. The {TOPCon} with a modified nc-{SiOx} exhibits a dominant open circuit voltage (Voc) of 761 {mV} with a supreme {FF} of 83\%.

	abstract = {High conversion efficiency can achieve by superior surface passivation and material quality. In this study, a novel passivation contact structure based on nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-{SiOx}) films was investigated. Traditionally, poly silicon junctions in tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells possess exceptional junction characteristics, but current losses are noted due to their optical absorption if they are applied in solar cell devices. In this study, we replaced the poly-Si layer in {TOPCon} solar cells with nc-{SiOx} to enhance transparency. By employing the nc-{SiOx} layer, effective surface passivation, carrier selectivity, electrical properties and optical transmission can be used to improve, all are vitally important in devise operation. We optimized the deposited nc-{SiOx} layer on an ultra-thin ({\textasciitilde}1.5 nm) silicon dioxide ({SiO}2) tunnel oxide layer to improve recombination current density and carrier lifetime. The passivation characteristics were improved by varying the annealing temperature and thickness of the nc-{SiOx} layer. The 50 nm thick nc-{SiOx} layer was capable of yielding a high implied open-circuit voltage (i-Voc) of 739 {mV} and low contact resistivity (ρ) of 14.2 ({mΩ}/cm2) in addition to a low depleted recombination current density (Jo) of 1.1 {fA}/cm2 with a post-deposition annealing temperature up to 950 ◦C. Improved passivation characteristics are the result of a more prominent annealing temperature.

The use of patterned poly-Si only under the front metal grid lines can significantly reduce the parasitic absorption loss without sacrificing voltage. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, manufacturing-friendly method of patterning the front poly-Si using a nanosecond {UV} (355 nm) laser. We found that with laser powers {\textbackslash}geq 3 W at a 400 mm/s scan speed, an estimated 1–4 nm thick stoichiometric {SiO}2 layer was grown on {TOPCon}. This served as a mask for {KOH}-etching of 200 nm poly-Si, allowing for patterning of poly-Si fingers required for selective {TOPCon}. While laser powers above 3 W caused substantial deterioration in passivation quality, the resulting damage in J0 was largely recovered by subsequent {PECVD} {SiNx} deposition. At 3 W, the full area J0 was found to be 36.8 {fA}·cm−2. This translates to 1.68 {fA}·cm−2 for 4.48\% coverage from the wing area of the polyfinger lines (100 lines–100 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm wide and 30 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm metal) contributing to a total front J0 of ∼10 {fA}·cm−2, well suited for 25\% efficient solar cells.},

Here, a c-Si cell with a tunneling oxide passivating contact ({TOPCon}) structure produced on a production line as the bottom cell of a tandem device, and a top cell featuring solution-processed perovskite films to form the tandem device are used.

Moreover, the origin of reflection loss on this planar structure is investigated and the reflection loss is managed to below 4 {mA} cm−2. In addition, the source of the voltage loss from the {TOPCon} bottom cell is identified and the device structure is redesigned to be suitable for tandem applications while still using mass production feasible fabrication methods.

	abstract = {Improving the conversion efficiency of n-{TOPCon} solar cell is still a hot topic. The selective poly-Si based passivating contacts (Poly-{SEs}) are ideal candidates for reducing the parasitic absorption and contact resistivity of n-type silicon solar cells and for providing better current collection. In this work, we used {LPCVD} and the {POCl}3 tube furnace diffusion methods to fabricate the selective poly-Si based passivating contacts, and studied the influences of key process parameters of the {SiOx} layer formation process (the oxidation duration (toxidation) and the constant pressure duration (tpressure)), and {POCl}3 tube diffusion process parameters (the {POCl}3-N2 carrier gas flow rate at the deposition, deposition temperature, drive-in temperature) on the n+-poly-Si profiles, recombination current density (J0), contact resistivity (ρc) of n-{TOPCon} solar cells. The results showed that the toxidation and tpressure had a significant impact on J0 and ρc which were mainly related to the distribution number of O and Si4+ content on the growth of the {SiOx} layer. And the influence of the drive-in temperature of phosphorus (P) diffusion process on J0 value is stronger than that of the deposition temperature, which was mainly related to the chemical passivation of {SiOx} layer induced by P-indiffusion into Si at high temperature. The reduction in the thickness of poly-Si from 110 nm to 30 nm led to an increase in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) per nanometer of {\textasciitilde}0.0093 {mA}/cm2 per nm. The Poly-{SEs} were fabricated by 3D printing mask technology and secondary {LPCVD}/phosphorus diffusion with J0, n+ ≈ 5 {fA}/cm2 (n+-poly-Si layer ≈ 50 nm) and J0, metal,n++ ≈ 73.8 {fA}/cm2 (n++-poly-Si layer ≈ 110 nm), and the efficiency was improved by 0.12\% owing to the increase in Jsc value of 0.28 {mA}/cm2. After optimizing the passivation process, the industrial-grade {TOPCon} bifacial cells reached an efficiency (Eff), Voc, Jsc, and {FF} values as high as 25.4\%, 721 {mV}, 42.2 {mA}/cm2, and 83.5\%, respectively.},

Further improving the quality of physical contact has become a focus of ongoing research. The film blistering issue has been identified as one of the major bottlenecks for the polysilicon (poly-Si) films deposited by the {PECVD} approach. In this study, we investigated how the in-situ phosphorus (P) doping level within the {polySi} films contributes to the occurrence of blistering. Our investigations into the film blistering mechanisms reveal that a high in-situ P-doping suppresses hydrogen release levels and reduces the accumulation of residual stress during annealing, which leads to the blistering-free appearance, especially observed in heavily P-doped poly-Si films. However, as excessive P-doping could weaken the interfacial passivation quality, we propose a bi-layer structure of P-doped poly-Si films which allows the doping profile to be tailored and maintain good quality passivating contacts. Based on the bi-layer structure, we fabricated industrial-sized tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells, which attained an average efficiency of 23.84\%.

A primary concern is the direct contact between front-sided metal electrodes and boron emitters, resulting in substantial carrier recombination losses and limiting further efficiency improvements. Here, we introduce a low-temperature approach to deposit a local boron-doped amorphous silicon [a-Si:H(p)] between front-sided metal electrodes and boron emitters. This method, avoiding issues associated with high-temperature processes, demonstrates excellent passivation and contact properties, featuring the lowest contact resistivity ({\textless} 1 {mΩ}⋅cm2) and a low saturation current density ({\textless} 400 {fA}/cm2). The outstanding passivation and contact properties remain robust even with variations in diborane flow rates during a-Si:H(p) fabrication, annealing temperatures, and sheet resistances of boron emitters. We elucidate the factors contributing to the enhanced passivation observed in boron emitters with a-Si:H(p) through a combination of simulations and experiments. The a-Si:H(p) layer between boron emitters and metal electrodes acts as a protective barrier, preventing the diffusion of metal atoms and suppressing carrier recombination. A heterojunction is formed between a-Si:H(p) and the boron emitter, facilitating electric-field passivation. Consequently, the {TOPCon} {SCs} incorporating a-Si:H(p) achieve an efficiency of 24.50\%, surpassing their counterparts without a-Si:H(p) (23.11\%). This work utilizes low-temperature technology to achieve fully passivated contact, providing insights for the development of high-efficiency {TOPCon} {SCs}.},

	abstract = {Tunneling oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells have made a considerable impact on the global photovoltaic ({PV}) market. Yet, its relatively poorer reliability compared to Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact ({PERC}) solar cells puts costly limitations on the module bill of materials that can be used. The use of silver/ aluminum (Ag/Al) paste for front-side metallization is identified as a key factor contributing to the relatively poor reliability of {TOPCon} modules, particularly at high temperatures and humidity. However, very recently, laser-assisted firing techniques such as laser-enhanced contact optimization ({LECO}) that combine conventional co-firing at relatively low temperatures with a subsequent laser treatment have emerged as an appealing alternative to standard one-step cofiring. The main driver for laser-assisted firing is enabling higher power conversion efficiencies ({PCE}). This technique permits the application of screen printing pastes with considerably reduced levels of aluminum (Al), or even the complete exclusion of Al. Consequently, the enhancement in {PCE} values may not only boost {PCE}, but may also offer benefits in terms of reliability. This study investigates the impact of Jolywood Special Injected Metallization ({JSIM}) method on the reliability of {TOPCon} solar cells. Cell level damp heat testing at 85 ◦C and 85\% relative humidity ({DH}85) with selected impurities reveals a significant improvement for the {JSIM} solar cells versus the standard baseline {TOPCon} cells. Baseline cells experienced rapid degradation, with a substantial ({\textasciitilde}92\%rel) loss in {PCE} attributed to a significant ({\textasciitilde}13,000\%rel) increase in series resistance (Rs) when exposed to sodium chloride ({NaCl}). Conversely, {JSIM} cells showcased remarkable resilience, displaying only a modest drop in {PCE} ({\textasciitilde}3.6\%rel) under similar conditions. This work clearly shows that laserassisted firing processes such as {JSIM} also significantly improve the reliability of {TOPCon} solar cells. This improvement is due to the compatibility of these processes with screen printing pastes that have low or zero Al concentration for the {TOPCon} front. Consequently, this approach enables using more cost-effective materials for {TOPCon} modules, thereby reducing the overall cost of solar electricity.},

	abstract = {The laser-enhanced contact optimization ({LECO}) process, instead of the conventional high-temperature sintering process on the tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells, is being migrated to mainstream technology, with ongoing improvements in recent years. This study examines the impact of various process parameters—including sintering temperature, laser power, and reverse voltage—within the {LECO} process on the metallization-induced recombination current density associated with metal contact (denoted as J0,metal), contact resistivity (represented as ρc), and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. On the basis of the experiment, {COMSOL} simulations were introduced to model the changes in charge carrier dynamics during {LECO}. The influence of laser power and reverse voltage on the front surface electron concentration was systematically investigated and confirmed. The findings indicated that appropriately reducing the sintering temperature can significantly decrease metallization recombination. At the same time, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) showed a negative correlation with both the laser energy and reverse voltage. Conversely, the fill factor ({FF}) and contact resistivity (ρc) positively correlated with these factors. Data from ρc and I-V measurements demonstrated that adequate laser energy is crucial for achieving sufficient carrier concentrations, which is necessary for minimizing ρc. However, excessively high laser energy may harm the passivation layer. Simulation analysis confirmed that the laser in the {LECO} process generates electron-hole pairs, while the reverse voltage separates the electrons and holes. We implemented the {LECO} process utilizing a sintering temperature of 790 ◦C, laser power of 18 W, and a reverse voltage of 16 V to enhance the maximum efficiency. (Eff) of 25.97 \%, corresponding to a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 42.05 {mA}/cm2, a Voc of 731.5 {mV}, and a fill factor ({FF}) of 84.42 \%. The findings presented herein provide valuable insights that will inform the subsequent investigation of novel cell structures.},
