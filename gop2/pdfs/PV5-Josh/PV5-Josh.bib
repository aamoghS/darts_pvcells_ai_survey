	abstract = {A big challenge to improve the conversion efficiency of n-type solar cell is the recombination and electrical contacting of boron (B)-doped emitters in n-{TOPCon} solar cells. This work investigates the emitter dark saturation current density under the passivation layer (J0e, passivated), the metallization-induced recombination current density under the metal contact (J0e, metal), and the I–V parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor ({FF}) and efficiency (Eff) as functions of the peak concentration (Nmax) and junction depth of B-doped profile. We introduced the profile with the peak concentration of 1–1.5 × 1019 atoms/cm3 and a junction depth of 0.75–1.0 μm to improve the conversion efficiency of 23.4\%. The results revealed that Jsc, implied Voc ({iVoc}) and the contact resistance (ρc) were negative correlated with the Nmax and junction depth. However, J0e, passivated had a positive correlation with the same. The results from ρc, J0e along with the I–V showed the junction depth of emitter doping profiles need to exceed the corroded depth of Ag/Al paste to get a low ρc, meanwhile, a low J0e should be ensured. The results suggested {theB}-selective emitters were developed with a low ρc and a low J0e. After optimizing B-selective emitters and passivation processes, we obtained industry-grade {TOPCon} cells with Eff, Voc, Jsc, and {FF} as high as 23.7\%, 709 {mV}, 40.8 {mA}/cm2, and 82\%, respectively. This optimized B-doped and simplified B-selective emitters processes can be commercially applied in photovoltaics.},

In this study, we investigated and characterized one recent batch of {TOPCon} cells fabricated on 156.75 � 156.75 � 0.18mm3 wafers with fully screen-printed technology by an industrial-type process. {TOPCon} cells with an efficiency as high as 22.43\%, a Voc value as high as 689.4 {mV}, and a fill factor as high as 81.35\% were obtained. The P dopant diffusion in the poly Si layer as well as the thickness of the {SiOx} layer were optimized in order to obtain good electrical contact between screen-printed Ag and Si. The thickness of the {SiOx} layer should be over 1.5 nm, which is beneficial for obtaining a good passivation for the cells. The surface P dopant concentration in the polycrystalline Si was higher than 1 � 1020 atom/cm3, resulted in a low series resistance and a high fill factor. The characterization and simulation results show that both metal shading loss and rear surface recombination were dominant among all of the losses. Application to solar cells with a Voc of 697 {mV} and a fill factor of 82.45\% could lead to an independently confirmed cell efficiency of over 23\% for n-type cells with poly Si the herein developed passivated rear contacts, and the front metal contacts by addressing the issue of reducing metal recombination and implementing a selective emitter.},

In this study, a novel passivation contact structure based on nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-{SiOx}) films was investigated. Traditionally, poly silicon junctions in tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells possess exceptional junction characteristics, but current losses are noted due to their optical absorption if they are applied in solar cell devices. In this study, we replaced the poly-Si layer in {TOPCon} solar cells with nc-{SiOx} to enhance transparency. By employing the nc-{SiOx} layer, effective surface passivation, carrier selectivity, electrical properties and optical transmission can be used to improve, all are vitally important in devise operation. We optimized the deposited nc-{SiOx} layer on an ultra-thin ({\textasciitilde}1.5 nm) silicon dioxide ({SiO}2) tunnel oxide layer to improve recombination current density and carrier lifetime. The passivation characteristics were improved by varying the annealing temperature and thickness of the nc-{SiOx} layer. The 50 nm thick nc-{SiOx} layer was capable of yielding a high implied open-circuit voltage (i-Voc) of 739 {mV} and low contact resistivity (ρ) of 14.2 ({mΩ}/cm2) in addition to a low depleted recombination current density (Jo) of 1.1 {fA}/cm2 with a post-deposition annealing temperature up to 950 ◦C. Improved passivation characteristics are the result of a more prominent annealing temperature. Our proposed technique has immense potential for achieving higher efficiency for fabricating various structures of {TOPCon} solar cells. As per {AFORST} Het simulation results by using nc-{SiOx} for {TOPCon} structure, we got Voc of 761.5 {mV}, Jsc of 43.5 {mA}/cm2, {FF} of 83\%, and η of 27.49\%, respectively.},

In this work, the effects of different chemical etching methods and weight loss on the surface topography and passivation characteristics and contact resistance of {SiOx}/n + poly Si passivated contact structures were investigated by finely controlling the etching process. Studies have shown that for textured surfaces, both increasing the roundness of the pyramids (acid polishing) and flattening the pyramids (alkaline polishing) lead to a more uniform {SiOx} layer, which improves surface passivation. The significant deterioration of the contact resistance of the alkali-polished flat surface may be more due to the influence of the thickness of the tunnel oxide layer and the concentration of trailing P doping in the substrate. Acid polishing preserves the round pyramid structure but removes the sharp pyramid tips, improving contact passivation while ensuring good metal contact. It can better balance the contradiction between passivation characteristics (J0 {\textasciitilde} 4.73fA/cm2, J0, metal {\textasciitilde} 67.26fA/cm2, {iVoc} {\textasciitilde} 740 {mV}) and contact characteristics (ρc, B {\textasciitilde} 1.67mΩcm2), and achieve the highest average cell efficiency (24.05\%).},

In the case of the rear film, we introduce a {NH}3 plasma treatment to elevate hydrogen content of {SiNx}. These additional hydrogens diffuse into the interfacial silicon oxide during the firing process to help reduce the number of surface dangling bonds and inhibit the degradation of the passivating contacts, which significantly contributes to enhanced passivation quality.

	abstract = {Improving the conversion efficiency of n-{TOPCon} solar cell is still a hot topic. The selective poly-Si based passivating contacts (Poly-{SEs}) are ideal candidates for reducing the parasitic absorption and contact resistivity of n-type silicon solar cells and for providing better current collection. In this work, we used {LPCVD} and the {POCl}3 tube furnace diffusion methods to fabricate the selective poly-Si based passivating contacts, and studied the influences of key process parameters of the {SiOx} layer formation process (the oxidation duration (toxidation) and the constant pressure duration (tpressure)), and {POCl}3 tube diffusion process parameters (the {POCl}3-N2 carrier gas flow rate at the deposition, deposition temperature, drive-in temperature) on the n+-poly-Si profiles, recombination current density (J0), contact resistivity (ρc) of n-{TOPCon} solar cells. The results showed that the toxidation and tpressure had a significant impact on J0 and ρc which were mainly related to the distribution number of O and Si4+ content on the growth of the {SiOx} layer. And the influence of the drive-in temperature of phosphorus (P) diffusion process on J0 value is stronger than that of the deposition temperature, which was mainly related to the chemical passivation of {SiOx} layer induced by P-indiffusion into Si at high temperature. The reduction in the thickness of poly-Si from 110 nm to 30 nm led to an increase in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) per nanometer of {\textasciitilde}0.0093 {mA}/cm2 per nm. The Poly-{SEs} were fabricated by 3D printing mask technology and secondary {LPCVD}/phosphorus diffusion with J0, n+ ≈ 5 {fA}/cm2 (n+-poly-Si layer ≈ 50 nm) and J0, metal,n++ ≈ 73.8 {fA}/cm2 (n++-poly-Si layer ≈ 110 nm), and the efficiency was improved by 0.12\% owing to the increase in Jsc value of 0.28 {mA}/cm2. After optimizing the passivation process, the industrial-grade {TOPCon} bifacial cells reached an efficiency (Eff), Voc, Jsc, and {FF} values as high as 25.4\%, 721 {mV}, 42.2 {mA}/cm2, and 83.5\%, respectively.},

The passivation of the tunnel-{SiOx}/nþ-poly-Si/{SiNx}:H structure on silicon wafers is investigated. The saturation currents Jo of this structure on polished and textured silicon surfaces are 1.3 and 3.7 {fA}/cm2, respectively. After printing the Ag contacts, the Jo of this structure increases to 50.7 {fA}/cm2 on textured silicon surfaces, which is still manageably low for metal contacts. This structure was applied to i-{TOPCon} solar cells, resulting in a median efficiency of 23.91\%, measured in-house, and a champion efficiency of 24.58\%, independently confirmed by the {ISFH} {CalTeC} in Germany.

	abstract = {The boron diffusion process in the front field of N-type tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) solar cells is crucial for {PN} junction formation and the creation of a selective emitter. This study presents a theoretical model of boron diffusion in silicon using molecular dynamics. The research examines the mean square displacement and diffusion coefficient of boron atoms at varying temperatures, confirming their diffusion behavior. The simulations indicate predominant boron diffusion in the z-direction within the silicon matrix, with the diffusion depth being temperature dependent. The optimal temperature range for boron diffusion in silicon is identified as 950 ◦C to 1050 ◦C. Using boron-doped silicon paste and boron trichloride as dopants, thermal diffusion experiments were conducted to fabricate the front-field {PN} junction (p+ layer) and selective emitter (p++ layer) by one step. Subsequent processing and performance evaluation were performed on a production line. Experimental findings reveal a decrease in boron diffusion at higher temperatures, reduced sheet resistance, increased doping concentration, and deeper junction formation. The ideal boron concentration in the p+ layer is 8.68 × 1018 atom/ cm3 with a depth of 0.53 μm, while the p++ layer is 2.35 × 1019 atom/cm3 and 0.82 μm. The efficiency of the optimized {TOPCon} + cell production line reaches up to 25.17 \%, marking an improvement of 0.23 \% over the standard cell production line. This research contributes to elucidating the mechanism of boron diffusion and offers insights for enhancing the efficiency of {TOPCon} solar cells.},

	abstract = {We report an industrial compatible tunnel oxide passivated contact ({TOPCon}) structure on solar-grade p-type {cSi} wafer as the rear emitter for high-efficiency solar cells, where the ultrathin silicon oxide ({SiOx}) is made by plasma-assisted oxidation and the P-doped n-type poly-Si (n+-poly-Si) contact layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition ({PECVD}) of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with in-situ doping with {PH}3 and following the high-temperature annealing. The fabrication processes of {SiOx} and n+-poly-Si layers are systematically optimized. It is found that the optimized annealing temperature for the crystallization and dopant activation is in the range of 850 °C and 880 °C, which is higher than the similar structure with chemically oxidized {SiOx} (820 °C). In addition, the samples made with higher {PH}3/{SiH}4 doping ratio during the a-Si:H deposition need a lower annealing temperature to reach the similar dopant distribution within the samples made with lower doping ratio but annealed at higher temperature, it means that the optimized annealing temperature decreases with the increase of the {PH}3/{SiH}4 doping ratio during the deposition of a-Si:H precursor. The optimized process with post-hydrogenation yields excellent surface passivation on the p-type Si substrate with the implied opencircuit voltage ({iVoc}) of ∼742 {mV}, the single-side saturated recombination current density (J0) of ∼3.0 {fA}/cm2, the contact resistivity (ρc) of ∼2–4 {mΩ} cm2, and the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) of ∼1050 μs (Δn = 1 × 1015 cm-3). With these passivation parameters, a simulation study demonstrates the advantage of rear emitter over the conventional front emitter {TOPCon} solar cell with ∼22.8\% achievable efficiency on solar-grade p-type wafers with current industrial constraints, and ∼24.9\% on high quality p-type c-Si wafers with the optimized conditions in R\&D laboratories. Our study suggests that the p-type c-Si solar cell with a rear n+-poly-Si {TOPCon} emitter is a viable structure for high-efficiency solar cell production.},

In situ doped poly-Si films are studied as their use could simplify the production of industrial n-{TOPCon} solar cells compared to the common approach relying on ex situ doping of intrinsic {LPCVD} poly-Si films. The developed poly-Si passivating contacts exhibited excellent characteristics with low recombination current densities in passivated and screen-printing metallized regions down to 2.3 {fA}/cm2 and 65.8 {fA}/cm2, respectively, and a low contact resistivity of 2.0 {mΩ}⋅cm2. For reaching the best passivating contact characteristics and high solar cell efficiencies, a poly-Si film thickness of 150–200 nm was found to be optimal while a polished rear surface morphology was found to be beneficial. The best solar cell reached a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.01\% along with a high open circuit voltage of 691.7 {mV}, enabled by the passivating contacts with the in situ doped poly-Si films. 1-cell glass-glass laminates were also fabricated with the developed solar cells, which showed no loss in their power output both upon 400 thermal cycles and after 1000 h of damp heat testing. Lastly, a roadmap is presented, indicating strategies to achieve efficiencies up to 25.5\% with n-{TOPCon} solar cells incorporating the in situ P-doped {LPCVD} poly-Si films.},

	abstract = {Screen-printing Ag paste on the rear side of the Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact solar cells ({TOPCon}) is still the mainstream method to form electrodes. However, the high price of precious metals increases the cost of {TOPCon} cells. Al is a cheap and high-performance conductor, and its work function is compatible with the rear side of {TOPCon} cells. In this study, we used a {UV} pulse laser (355 nm, 10 ps) to ablate the rear side {SiNx} passivation layer of {TOPCon} cells and then printed Al paste with different weight percentages of silicon (Si-wt.\%) on the phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon (n+-poly-Si) layer to reduce the cost. We investigated the damage mechanism of laser on {SiOx}/n+-poly-Si/{SiNx} passivation structure and the contact mechanism between Al paste and n+-poly-Si layer. The results show that the Voc of {SiOx}/n+-poly-Si/{SiNx} passivation structure reduced about 6–7 {mV} when the laser energy density was 0.431 J/cm2. We got the best electrical performance of {TOPCon} cells printed with Al paste (25 wt\%-29 wt\% silicon). The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the conversion efficiency (Eff), have reached 663.60 {mV} and 22.56 \% respectively. Although the efficiency was 9.40 \% relative lower than that of {TOPCon} cells printed with Ag paste, but the cost of Al paste only accounted for 10 \% of Ag paste. In the future, the highest Eff of {TOPCon} solar cells printed with Al paste on the rear side are expected to reach the commercial {TOPCon} based on Ag paste, which applies laser doping selective emitter technology ({SE}) and bifacial poly-Si passivation structure.},

	abstract = {Passivating contact solar cells have gradually become the mainstream cell technology due to their excellent performance, and further improving the conversion efficiency has become a focus of subsequent research. Typically, achieving excellent field-effect passivation and low contact resistivity in doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) requires heavy phosphorus doping. However, this approach can lead to a predicament wherein excessive phosphorus diffuses into the silicon (Si) substrate during annealing, consequently causing recombination losses. In response to this challenge, a structure incorporating an intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si (i)) layer within the passivation layers has been introduced. The primary objective of this structure is to retard the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate. This study entails comprehensive characterizations to delve into the underlying mechanisms of films with the integrated a-Si (i) layer, including surface microscopy, active dopants profile, crystallographic structure, elemental distribution, and electrical properties. Finally, we have fabricated the industrial-sized {TOPCon} solar cells with an average efficiency of 23.83 \%, which is 0.25 \% higher than that of Baseline counterparts (23.58 \%) on the production line. The above results have demonstrated the introduction of a-Si (i) film can be a buffer layer, retarding the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate and obtaining a better passivation effect, enabling us to further tailor the doping profile for high-efficiency solar cells. Our work highlights a promising strategy to improve the performance of {TOPCon} solar cells, showcasing the substantial potential for implementation in industrial manufacturing.},

Improving the quality of passivation contact has become a central focus of current research. Although the conventional monolayer polycrystalline silicon method is highly effective in {TOPCon} solar cells, it is limited by doping inhomogeneity, which impairs the passivation and electrical properties, and the cell’s photovoltaic conversion efficiency remains suboptimal. To address this issue, this study investigates the deposition of two layers of silicon oxide and two layers of in-situ doped phosphorus amorphous silicon, termed double poly-Si/{SiOx} structures, on n-type silicon wafers using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition ({PECVD}). The effectiveness of the structure was confirmed through various characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}), X-ray diffraction ({XRD}), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS}). Key findings indicate that the double-polysilicon structure significantly enhances the uniformity of phosphorus doping, improving the carrier lifetime of the cell and reducing the contact resistance. As a result, the average efficiency in the final production stage has a conversion efficiency gain of 0.23 \% over the baseline group. This study underscores the potential of this {PECVD} methodology to advance the fabrication of highefficiency solar cells by providing significant improvements in passivation, doping uniformity, and overall cell performance.},
