n solar cells. This experi
-
ment is referred to as the rear surface morphology screening experiment. For this, a reference group of 7 solar cells was prepared with the same design and process as for the t
poly 
screening experiment i.e., the rear surface morphology was semi-textured. For this reference group, a single t
poly 
value of 150 nm was chosen. In addition, another group of 14 solar cells was fabricated, also with t
poly 
=150 nm but a polished rear surface morphology. The design of th
