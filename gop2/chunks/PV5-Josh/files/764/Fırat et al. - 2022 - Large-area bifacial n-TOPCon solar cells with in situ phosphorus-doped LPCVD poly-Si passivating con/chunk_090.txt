 optical improvement originates from a gain in EQE at long wavelengths. This leads to the conclusion that the polished rear surface offers enhanced light trapping compared to the semi-textured one, which also explains the higher R at long wavelengths, as more light is internally reflected at the polished rear, increasing the escape reflectance. It is important to note, however, that the use of the polished rear surface also reduces the bifaciality from 81.2 Â±0.3%, in the case of the semi-textur
