affect the FF, yielding a 0.6% increase. In step 4, another 
 
gain of 0.2% is predicted when going for thinner poly-Si films with t
poly 
=75 nm, which is expected to become the industry standard thickness by 2028 when new screen-printing pastes which can contact thinner poly-Si films with low J
0,m 
are developed [1]. As explained before, reduced t
poly 
results in less FCA and a consequent 0.3 mA/cm

increase in J

. An impressive

of 24.3% i.e., a gain of 1.5% absolute, can be achiev
