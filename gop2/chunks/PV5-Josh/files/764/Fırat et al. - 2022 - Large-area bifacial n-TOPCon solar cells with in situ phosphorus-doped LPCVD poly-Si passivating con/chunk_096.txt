 The findings of the solar cell development thus reveal that the use of a sufficiently thick poly-Si film and a polished rear surface morphology are key for enabling high efficiencies. For further increasing the

and thus improving the V
oc 
of the devices by enhancing the passivation of the front surface and by passivating the front contacts as the high J
0,p,f 
and J
0,m,f 
in Fig. 5 suggest, and (ii) improving the relatively low E
