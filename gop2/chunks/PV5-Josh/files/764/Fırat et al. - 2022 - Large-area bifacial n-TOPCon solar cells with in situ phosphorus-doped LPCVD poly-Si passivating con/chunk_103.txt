obtained in the literature using a similar DARC design on n-TOPCon solar cells [33]. We would like to note that using a DARC at the rear side of the solar cells can also be useful for boosting the bifaciality, but this would come at the price of increased process complexity. Table 5 also shows that, as expected, DARC has little to no impact on V
