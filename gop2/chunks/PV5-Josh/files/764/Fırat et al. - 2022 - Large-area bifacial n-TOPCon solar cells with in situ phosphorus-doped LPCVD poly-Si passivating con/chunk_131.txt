for fabricating solar cells with record efficiencies, it can be difficult to implement those in pro
-
duction, since fabrication of the advanced emitter requires a long pro

cess duration [48] and realizing the selective emitter requires patterning, increasing the process complexity. In step 8, recombination losses in the non-metallized regions of the front surface are further reduced using a transparent passivating contact at the front, covering the entire solar cell. This could potentially be
