 cycles, after which it dropped by 1.3% absolute during the following 300 cycles. The initial FF improvement is associated with a significant drop in the series resistance of the laminate, which is attributed to modifications in the properties of the interconnections, as the series resistance of the solar cell itself is not expected to change during thermal cycling. Nevertheless, the physical mechanism behind the change in the properties of the interconnections is not well-understood. 4.Roadmap
