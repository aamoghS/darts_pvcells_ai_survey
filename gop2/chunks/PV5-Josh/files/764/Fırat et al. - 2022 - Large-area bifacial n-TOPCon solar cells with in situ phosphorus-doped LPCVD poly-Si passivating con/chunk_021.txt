ssivating contacts and the solar cells are reported for two types of rear surface morphologies: semi-textured and polished. The paper also reports on the suitability of the developed solar cells for application in PV modules by means of thermal cycling and damp heat tests. In addition, a roadmap is provided which shows how the efficiency of n-TOPCon solar cells featuring in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD can be further improved starting from the baseline established in this work. 2.Material
