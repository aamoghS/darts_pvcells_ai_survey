shows that solar cells with thicker poly-Si films are more efficient, with a significant jump of 0.4% in

for t
poly 
increasing from 100 to 150 nm, but only a 0.1% improvement when t
poly 
is further raised to 200 nm. Differences between the other parameters of the three solar cell groups reveal two opposite trends with increasing t
poly
, which explain the nonlinear improvement of the average
