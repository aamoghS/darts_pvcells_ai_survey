poly 
=150 nm shows that the average 
 
has slightly improved by 0.1%. This is due to the 0.7% jump in FF, which follows from the lower r
s 
of 0.6 cm

, and is attributed to the improved screen-printing process, yielding little to no finger interruptions as found by optical microscopy. The reason for the limited gain in 
 
despite this significant FF increase seems to be the drop in V

by 2.4 mV. To understand this loss in V
