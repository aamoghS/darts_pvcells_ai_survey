ors based on the literature: (i) the reduced surface area compared to the semi-textured surface, (ii) the lower dangling bond density of (100)-oriented surfaces than the (111)-oriented facets, with the former and the latter exposed to a greater extent in case of the polished and semi-textured surfaces, respectively, and (iii) the reduction in stress related defects in the SiO
