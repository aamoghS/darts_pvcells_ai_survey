ysilicon LPCVD In situ phosphorus doping 
ABSTRACT  
The potential of passivating contacts incorporating in situ phosphorus (P)-doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) films grown by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is demonstrated in this work by integrating these layers at the rear side of large-area (241.3 cm

) bifacial n-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (n- TOPCon) solar cells with diffused front emitter and screen-printed contacts. In situ doped poly-Si films are studied
