ties, obtained here on semi-textured surfaces, with the corresponding results on textured surfaces reported in our previous work indicates a good agreement [26]. Despite the reproducibility of the results, it is not well-understood why J
0,p,r 
and 

c,r 
are lower for higher t
poly
. This calls for a more detailed study on the impact of t
poly 
on the poly-Si film properties such as the doping profile, which is beyond the scope of this work and will be targeted in the future. In addition to th
