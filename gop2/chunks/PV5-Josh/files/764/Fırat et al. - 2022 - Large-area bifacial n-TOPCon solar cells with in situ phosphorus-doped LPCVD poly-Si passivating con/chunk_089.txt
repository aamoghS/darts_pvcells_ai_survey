rface morphology resulting from polishing allows the fabrication of n-TOPCon solar cells which are 0.4% more efficient on average. While minor improvements are observed in V
oc 
and FF of the solar cells with polished rear, the main reason behind the efficiency gain is clearly the 0.5 mA/cm
2 
increase in J
sc
. Results of R and EQE measurements performed on solar cells with different rear surface morphology, depicted in Fig. 8a), reveal that the optical improvement originates from a gain in EQE
