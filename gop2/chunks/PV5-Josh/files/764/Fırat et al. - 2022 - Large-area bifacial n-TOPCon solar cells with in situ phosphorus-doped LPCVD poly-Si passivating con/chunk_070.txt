ctor for the FF is also demonstrated by the performance of the best solar cell, on which little to no finger interruptions were found. As a result, the best solar cell has a significantly lower r
s 
of 0.5 cm
2 
and a higher FF of 81.1%. Despite r
s
-related losses being the dominant mechanism, these cannot explain the FF trend observed, since r
s 
is similar for all groups of solar cells. Instead, the behavior of FF with t
poly 
seems to follow that of the FF
n
. This suggests that the FF tre
