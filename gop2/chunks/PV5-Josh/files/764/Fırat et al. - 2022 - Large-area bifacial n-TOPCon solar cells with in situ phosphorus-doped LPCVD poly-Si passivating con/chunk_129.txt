film used in the simulations as the top layer of DARC is not suitable for module applications. Lastly, steps 6, 7, and 8 of the roadmap foresee the reduction in recombination losses at the front surface of the solar cell. In step 6, the losses in the non- metallized regions are decreased using a deeper, advanced emitter. The advanced emitter is known to yield a lower J
