. It is expected that, for t
poly 
beyond 200 nm, 
 
might drop due to increased J
sc 
losses, which might limit the solar cell performance, as shown in the literature [15]. For these reasons, 150 nm was chosen as the poly-Si thickness for the rear surface morphology screening experiment in this work. Apart from the
