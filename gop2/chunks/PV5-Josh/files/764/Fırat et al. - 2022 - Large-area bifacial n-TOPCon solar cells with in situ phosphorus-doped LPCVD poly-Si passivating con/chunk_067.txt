. In addition, the impact of parasitic absorption in the poly-Si films on the optical performance of solar cells is also evident from the bifaciality values of each solar cell group, measured as 82.1 ±0.5%, 80.2 ±0.6%, and 78.0 ±0.3%, for t
poly 
of 100, 150, and 200 nm, respectively. This is expected, since the parasitic absorption in the poly-Si at the illuminated side of the solar cell is known to increase with t
