The reader should note that, while dry etching was used in this work, wrap- around removal can also be performed by the simpler and more common approach based on single-side wet-chemical etching of poly-Si in a diluted alkaline solution, eliminating the masking step [12,30,31]. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 900
