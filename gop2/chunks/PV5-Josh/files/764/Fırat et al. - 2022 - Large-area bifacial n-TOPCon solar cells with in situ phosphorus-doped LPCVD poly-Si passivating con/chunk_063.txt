and FF improve, particularly when t
poly 
is raised from 100 to 150 nm. The loss in J
sc 
with higher t
poly 
is attributed to increased parasitic absorption in the heavily doped poly-Si film, mainly due to free carrier absorption (FCA). Our previous optical studies predict a linearly increasing J
sc 
loss as a function of t
