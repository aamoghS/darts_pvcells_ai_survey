2,9,10]. For the fabrication of the poly-Si films used in industrial n-TOPCon solar cells, low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) has been the primary choice so far [1]. The PV industry has favored this technique because of its high throughput and since LPCVD equipment offers the possibility of ther
