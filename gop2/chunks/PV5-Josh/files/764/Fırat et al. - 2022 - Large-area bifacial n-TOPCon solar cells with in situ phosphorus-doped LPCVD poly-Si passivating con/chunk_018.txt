in case of in situ doping, the overall cost of n-TOPCon solar cells incorporating in situ doped poly-Si passivating contacts can be lower by 0.2 $cents per Watt peak than the devices with conventional ex situ doped passivating contacts, if the annealing in case of in situ doping can be optimized to yield a shorter and leaner process [17,27]. Moreover, a simpler single-step p
