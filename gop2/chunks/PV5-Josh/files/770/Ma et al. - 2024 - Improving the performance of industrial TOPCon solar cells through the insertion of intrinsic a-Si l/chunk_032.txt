. While the tunneling oxide also contributes to preventing phosphorus diffusion, itâ€™s important to note that the passivation contact performance of TOPCon solar cells is highly sensitive to the thickness of the oxide layer. To strike a balance between these competing factors, we have maintained a constant thickness for the tunneling oxide layer throughout this study. Fig. 2 illustrates the phosphorus diffusion that occurred during the annealing process, considering varying thicknesses of the a
