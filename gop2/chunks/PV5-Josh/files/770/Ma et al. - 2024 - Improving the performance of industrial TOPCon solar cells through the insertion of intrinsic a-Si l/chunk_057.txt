ling oxide layer. To further investigate the change of O, P, and H atoms after annealing, SIMS was used to detect the intensity of atoms as a function of depth. Fig. 5(h) displayed the SIMS spectra, and the intensity change of O atoms was similar to the results shown in Fig. 5(g). In terms of P atoms, the Baseline group exhibited a notably higher P concentration, particularly after traversing the tunneling oxide layer, which was consistent with the ECV curve shown in Fig. 4(a). These above obser
