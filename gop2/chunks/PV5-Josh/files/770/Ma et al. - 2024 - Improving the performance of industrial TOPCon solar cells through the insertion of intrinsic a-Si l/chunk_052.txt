 and d) TEM images, (b and e) localized TEM images with HR-TEM and Fourier transform diffraction patterns, and (c and f) cross-sectional EDS distributions for the Baseline and G2 samples. (g) Depth-dependent net intensity spectra of Si, O, and P elements. (h) P, H, and O distributions measured by SIMS for the two related samples. Here, the samples were prepared after annealing with the introduced a-Si (i) film at the thickness of 0 nm and 20 nm, corresponding to the groups of Baseline and G2, re
