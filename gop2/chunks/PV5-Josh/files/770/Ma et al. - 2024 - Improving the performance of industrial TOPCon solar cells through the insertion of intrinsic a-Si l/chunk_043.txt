 the group of Baseline, the group of G1 had a similar Câ€“V curve, revealing its analogous blocking effect on phosphorus diffusion. While the thickness of a-Si (i) further increased, the decline curve became steeper, indicating the more obvious blocking effect on phosphorus diffusion. The aforementioned observations substantiated that the doping profile could be accurately regulated through the incorporation of the a-Si (i) layer.
