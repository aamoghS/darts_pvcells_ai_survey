 process, considering varying thicknesses of the a-Si (i) film. In this study, the total thickness of the a-Si film was fixed at 140 nm. The specific thicknesses of the a-Si (i) film were set at 0 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm, corresponding to the Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4 groups respectively. Throughout the annealing process, the a-Si film transformed into poly-Si, and the doped phosphorus became active. After that, the phosphorus atoms initiated diffusion into the Si substrate. As thi
