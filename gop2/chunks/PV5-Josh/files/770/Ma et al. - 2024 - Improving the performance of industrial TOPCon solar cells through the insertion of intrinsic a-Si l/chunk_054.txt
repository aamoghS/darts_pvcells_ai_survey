lyses were conducted on both the Baseline and optimized G2 groups after the annealing process, and the results were presented in Fig. 5. In the micrographs, the interface tunneling oxide layer displayed a uniform thickness acquired through the PECVD method, and the thickness range of 1.3â€“1.4 nm for the SiO

film was further confirmed by local HR-TEM images.
