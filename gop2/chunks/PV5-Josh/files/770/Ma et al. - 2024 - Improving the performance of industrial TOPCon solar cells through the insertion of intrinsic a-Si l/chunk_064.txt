e of blistering when the a-Si (i) layer thickness reached 30 nm, with increased severity as thickness further increased. Measurements using ECV corroborated the efficient control of in- diffusion dopant by the a-Si (i) layer. The passivation study showed that the optimal performance was obtained at the thickness of 20 nm, with the iV
