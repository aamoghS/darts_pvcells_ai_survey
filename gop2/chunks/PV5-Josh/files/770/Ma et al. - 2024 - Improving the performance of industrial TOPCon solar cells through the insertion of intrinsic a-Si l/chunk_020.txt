reby improving the passivation performance of cells. However, it remains to be verified whether this method can achieve similar results for industrialized n-TOPCon. In this paper, we have introduced a structure with an additional a-Si (i) film to the rear passivation layers of TOPCon solar cells, aiming to control the phosphorus (P) diffusion into the Si substrate, resulting in a tunable phosphorus doping profile to further improve passivated contact cell performance.
