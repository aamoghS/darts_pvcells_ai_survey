mparing the appearance of the film before and after annealing, it was apparent that the annealing process exacerbated the burst phenomenon, leading to larger bubble sizes, which could be attributed to the release and escape of hydrogen (H) during the high-temperature annealing process. When the thickness of the a-Si (i) film was further increased (G4), the size of the burst area was noticeably larger even before annealing. These observations indicated that while heavy phosphorus doping in the a-
