uation changed when the thickness of the a-Si (i) layer exceeded a specific threshold. Beyond this point, the burst phenomenon occurred and worsened as the filmâ€™s thickness increased. As reported in the literature, the crystallization of a-Si film leads to the accumulation of interfacial stress and rapid release of hydrogen, which are thought to be the main causes of film blistering [43,
