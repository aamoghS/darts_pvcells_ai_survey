sized TOPCon solar cells with an average efficiency of 23.83 %, which is 0.25 % higher than that of Baseline counterparts (23.58 %) on the production line. The above results have demonstrated the introduction of a-Si (i) film can be a buffer layer, retarding the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate and obtaining a better passivation effect, enabling us to further tailor the doping profile for high-efficiency solar cells. Our work highlights a promising strategy to improve the performanc
