industry in the past 20 years [2]. Many cell structures have been steadily developed to date, yielding two mainstream technologies for the past few years, i. e., tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) [3] and heterojunction technology (HJT) [4]. The fabrication of TOPCon can be upgraded from the existing passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) production lines, resulting in a record efficiency of 25.8 % on n-type c-Si [5], 26.0 % on p-type c-Si [6], and 26.1 % for an IBC [7] solar cell.
