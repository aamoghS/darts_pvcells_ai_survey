rameters were illustrated in Fig. 6. The trend in V
OC 
variations with different a-Si (i) thicknesses was consistent with the iV
OC 
measurements. Notably, the G2 group achieved the highest V
OC 
value of 715 mV, attributed to the blocking effect on phosphorus diffusion. The J
SC 
value remained unchanged with varying a-Si (i) thickness, implying that the introduction of a-Si
