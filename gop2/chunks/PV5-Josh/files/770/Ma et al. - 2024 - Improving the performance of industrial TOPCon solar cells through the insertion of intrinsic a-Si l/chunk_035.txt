ying the PECVD method. In this study, the samples were prepared on the polished c-Si substrate with different thicknesses of a-Si (i) film by tube PECVD method, and the rear passivation structure corresponded to the groups of Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4. To gain insights into the surface characteristics of the
