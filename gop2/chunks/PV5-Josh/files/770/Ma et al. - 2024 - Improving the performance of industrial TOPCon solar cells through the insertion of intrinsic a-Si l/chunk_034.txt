 initiated diffusion into the Si substrate. As this diffusion progressed deeper, the concentration of phosphorus began to decline after the phosphorus atoms traversed the tunneling oxide layer, and the blocking effect became more potent as the thickness of the a-Si (i) film increased. When incorporating the a-Si (i) film into the rear passivation layers of TOPCon solar cells, itâ€™s crucial to address the blistering issue, particularly when employing the PECVD method. In this study, the samples
