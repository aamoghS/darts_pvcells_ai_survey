 
was determined according to the high- injection method proposed by Kane and Swanson [41,42]. The iV
OC 
was tested at 1-sun. The contact resistivity (

c
) was measured by the TLM (Ai-shine). The structural and chemical composition of the c-Si/SiO
x
/poly-Si interface was investigated by high-resolution trans
-
mission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Talos F200X G2).
