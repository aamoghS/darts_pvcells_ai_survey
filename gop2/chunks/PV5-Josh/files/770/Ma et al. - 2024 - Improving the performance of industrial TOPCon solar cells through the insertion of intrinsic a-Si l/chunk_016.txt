pture from the surface of poly-Si, resulting in direct contact with the metal electrodes, and thus leading to high recombination loss [32, 33]. In summary, the blistering tendency and severity of the a-Si film depend on its H content, thickness, deposition temperature, thermal processing, surface roughness, and cleanliness [32â€“36]. In addition, interfacial stress accumulation induced during the crystallization of a-Si film has also been related to the occurrence of blistering [37]. Moreover, w
