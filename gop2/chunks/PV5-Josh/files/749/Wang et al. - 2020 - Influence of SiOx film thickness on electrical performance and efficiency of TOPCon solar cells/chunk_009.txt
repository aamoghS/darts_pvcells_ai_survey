three-step 
process. 
Firstly, 
the 
growth 
of 
an 
interfacial 
oxide 
layer, 
then 
the 
deposition 
of 
an 
amorphous 
(or 
polycrystalline) 
Si-based 
layer, 
lastly 
a 
high-temperature 
anneal 
process. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
interfacial 
oxide 
layer 
is 
to 
reduce 
dangling 
bonds 
and 
thus 
interface 
trapped 
charge 
density
