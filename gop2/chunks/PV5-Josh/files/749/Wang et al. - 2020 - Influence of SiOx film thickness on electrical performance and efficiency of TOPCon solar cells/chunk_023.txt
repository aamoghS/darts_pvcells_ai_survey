Characterization 
The 
current-voltage 
(I
â€“
V) 
parameters 
and 
curves 
of 
the 
TOPCon 
cell 
were 
measured 
in-house 
with 
DENKEN 
tester 
after 
calibration 
using 
a 
standard 
cell 
by 
Fraunhofer 
ISE. 
The 
dopant 
profiles 
of 
monitor 
wafers 
were 
measured 
by 
ECV 
device 
(WEP 
CVP21). 
The 
ECV-profiling 
tech
-
nique 
is 
employed 
to 
measure 
the 
dopant 
distribution 
and
