ABSTRACT  
The 
tunnel 
oxide 
passivated 
contact 
solar 
cells 
(TOPCon) 
on 
n-type 
Cz 
Si 
wafers 
instead 
of 
passivated 
emitter 
and 
rear 
solar 
cells 
are 
currently 
migrated 
to 
mainstream 
production, 
with 
ongoing 
improvements 
in 
recent 
years. 
In 
this 
study, 
we 
investigated 
and 
characterized 
one 
recent 
batch 
of
