oxide 
layers 
have 
a 
low 
surface 
concentration 
and 
are 
poorly 
passivated. 
In 
this 
work, 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
oxide 
layer 
has 
been 
further 
studied. 
There 
are 
several 
factors 
that 
influence 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
oxide 
tunnel 
layer, 
such 
as 
the 
chemical 
bond 
structure 
in 
the 
SiO

, 
stoichiometry 
and
