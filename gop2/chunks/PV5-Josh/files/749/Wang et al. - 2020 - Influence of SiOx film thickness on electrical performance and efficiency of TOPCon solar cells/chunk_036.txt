This 
breakup 
of 
the 
thin 
oxide 
layer 
was 
studied 
in 
detail 
by 
Wol

stenholme 
et 
al. 
[

]. 
Here, 
we 
further 
summarize 
and 
briefly 
review 
the 
study 
of 
interfacial 
oxide 
layer 
for 
solar 
cells 
(See 
Table

). 
After 
reviewing 
the 
previous 
publications, 
the 
mechanisms 
governing 
carrier 
conduction 
through 
the 
SiO
x 
layer 
are 
not 
well 
understood 
and 
based 
on 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
SiO
x
