The 
metal 
shading 
loss 
was 
due 
to 
the 
front 
metal 
grid. 
In 
this 
study, 
the 
metal 
area 
fraction 
on 
the 
front 
side 
is 
about 
2.74% 
for 
H 
pattern 
grid 
on 
both 
front 
and 
back. 
Therefore, 
thinning 
fingers 
could 
reduce 
metal 
area 
fraction 
and 
then 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
solar 
cells. 
While 
a 
reduced 
front 
metallization 
fraction 
could 
reduce 
shading 
loss, 
hence 
higher 
series 
resistance 
and
