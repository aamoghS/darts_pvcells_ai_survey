the

nm 
thick 
oxide 
layer 
is 
dense 
and 
continuous. 
However, 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
defects 
in 
1.25 
nm 
thin 
oxide 
layer 
might 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
passivation 
loss 
at 
locally 
thin 
SiO
x 
regions 
after 
high-temperature 
annealing 
process. 
This 
result 
is 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Ref.

Therefore, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
optimize 
the
