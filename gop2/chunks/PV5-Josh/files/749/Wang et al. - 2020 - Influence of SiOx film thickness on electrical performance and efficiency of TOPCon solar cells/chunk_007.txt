One 
is 
recombination 
at 
the 
metal 
contacts 
and 
the 
other 
is 
loss 
caused 
by 
two- 
or 
three-dimensional 
current 
transport 
paths. 
In 
order 
to 
overcome 
the 
two 
issues, 
a 
tunnel 
oxide 
passivated 
contact 
(TOPCon) 
cell 
structure 
has 
been 
proposed 
and 
developed, 
which 
could 
achieve 
an 
ultra-high 
efficiency 
of 
25.8% 
without 
an 
interdigitated 
back 
contact

TOPCon 
consists 
of

oxide
