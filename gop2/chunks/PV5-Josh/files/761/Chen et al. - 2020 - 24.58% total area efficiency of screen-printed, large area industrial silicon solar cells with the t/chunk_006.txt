so

attracted 
the 
interest 
from 
industry 
the 
most. 
In 
the 
TOPCon 
structure, 
the 
wafer 
is 
not 
contacted 
by 
metal 
directly. 
Instead, 
a 
thin 
tunnel 
oxide 
and 
then 
a 
heavily 
n- 
or 
p-doped 
poly 
Si 
layer 
is 
deposited 
which, 
finally, 
is 
contacted 
by 
metal. 
Because 
the 
tunnel 
oxide 
blocks 
one 
type 
of 
carrier, 
recombination 
behind 
the 
tunnel 
oxide 
does 
not 
influence 
device 
behavior, 
hence 
such 
structures 
are 
generally 
called
