around 
6%, 
therefore 
the 
total 
J

at 
the 
rear 
side 
of 
the

estimated 
to 
be 
7

The 
above 
analysis 
shows 
that 
the 
passivating 
contact 
has 
an 
excel
-
lent 
passivation 
performance. 
Furthermore, 
for 
device 
application, 
the 
electron 
transport 
must 
be 
successful 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
a 
low 
series 
resistance 
of 
the 
solar 
cell. 
The

of 
electron

through
