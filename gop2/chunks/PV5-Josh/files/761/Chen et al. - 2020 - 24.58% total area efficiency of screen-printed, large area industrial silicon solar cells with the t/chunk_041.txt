In 
a 
small 
experiment, 
two 
groups 
of 
i-TOPCon 
solar 
cells 
with 
the 
rear 
side 
SiO

structure 
were 
fabricated: 
one 
is 
the 
baseline, 
the 
other 
is 
with 
an 
improved 
process 
to 
enhance 
the 
infrared 
spectral 
response. 
The 
IV 
parameters 
were 
measured 
with 
the 
Sinton 
FCT-450 
flash 
tester 
as 
listed 
in 
Table

however 
without 
precise

cells 
available 
and 
with 
home-made 
probe 
bars 
at 
that 
time.
