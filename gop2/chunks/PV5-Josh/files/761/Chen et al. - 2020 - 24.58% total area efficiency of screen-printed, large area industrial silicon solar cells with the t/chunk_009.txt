ondly, 
a 
deposition 
system 
for 
poly-silicon 
with 
a 
high 
throughput 
is 
required. 
There 
are 
at

three 
different 
systems 
aiming 
to 
have 
mass

capability: 
low-pressure 
chemical 
vapor 
deposition 
(LPCVD) 
[

inline 
plasma 
enhanced 
CVD 
(PECVD) 
[

and 
inline 
atmospheric

CVD 
(APCVD) 
[
