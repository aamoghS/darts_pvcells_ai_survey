In 
our 
industrial 
surroundings, 
we 
lack 
analytical 
equipment 
for 
such 
thin 
films 
and 
estimate 
the 
oxide 
thickness 
via 
ellipsometry 
on 
alkaline 
polished 
silicon 
wafers 
to 
be 
1.3
â€“
1.7 
nm. 
Controlling 
the 
tunneling 
thickness 
during 
the 
process 
is 
critical 
and 
is 
fine-tuned 
empirically. 
The

at

partly 
polycrystalline,
