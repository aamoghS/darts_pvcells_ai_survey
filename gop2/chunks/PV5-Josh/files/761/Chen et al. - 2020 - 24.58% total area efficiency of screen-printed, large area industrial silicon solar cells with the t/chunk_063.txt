The 
losses 
at 
the 
rear 
passivating 
contact 
are 
far 
smaller 
despite 
the 
screen-printing 
assessed 
in 
the 
previous 
chapter. 
Crucial 
(and 
most 
uncertain 
in 
the 
simulations) 
are 
the 
recombination 
losses 
at 
the 
emitter 
contacts; 
they 
can 
easily 
dominate 
the 
losses 
at 
the 
front 
if 
the 
chosen 
screen-printing 
paste 
and 
the 
firing 
conditions 
are 
not 
as 
optimized.
