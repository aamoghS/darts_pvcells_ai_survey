(Fig. 3(b)). Since the exact tunneling mechanism and tunneling parameters were not fully known for our TOPCon, we measured phosphorus in-diffusion profile in Si bulk by electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) technique and replaced the n-TOPCon region by this profile with an effective surface recombination velocity tha
