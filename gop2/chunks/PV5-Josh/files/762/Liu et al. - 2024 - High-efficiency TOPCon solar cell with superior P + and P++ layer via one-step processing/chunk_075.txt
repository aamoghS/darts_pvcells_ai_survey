 the temperature and duration of B diffusion can ensure that B diffuses to the appropriate depth on the cellâ€™s surface, thereby enhancing the FF [3,16,29,30]. Specifically, the temperature of B diffusion has an effect on the filling coefficient. Appropriate B diffusion temperature can promote the interfacial reaction between metal electrode and Si substrate, which contributes to the formation of low contact resistance. Secondly, the duration of B diffusion also affects the contact resistance b
