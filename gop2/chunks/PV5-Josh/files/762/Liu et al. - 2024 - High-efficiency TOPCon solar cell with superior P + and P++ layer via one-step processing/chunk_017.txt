y calculating the diffusion coefficient of B in Si. Subsequently, a new method for preparing PN junction and SE are proposed. The traditional B trichloride and B-doped Si paste were used as doping sources to conduct B diffusion experiments, and then p
+
and p
++
layers were formed in a tube diffusion furnace by one step. The method has low cost and simple operation, can simplify the B diffusion process, and can expand the gap of doping amount between p
+
and p
++
layers. Then, the influence of t
