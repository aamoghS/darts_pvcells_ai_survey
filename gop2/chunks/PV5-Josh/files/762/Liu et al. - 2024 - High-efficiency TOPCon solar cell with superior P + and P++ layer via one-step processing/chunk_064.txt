s within the silica of BSG, while the other part is deposited on the surface of Si nanoparticles in the form of B-B and B-O bonds. During high-temperature doping, B atoms effectively diffuse, and during the thermal annealing process, B atoms from both forms further penetrate into Si nanoparticles. This approach enhances the uniformity of the doping layer and significantly increases the doping rate of B atoms. Fig. 10 (a) and (b) depict the schematic representation of the pre
