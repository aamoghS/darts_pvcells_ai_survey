tionally, the bottom of the monocrystalline Si and the top of the B-Si mixture (1.6 Ã… thickness) were held fixed along the vertical Z direction. The simulation assumed that the initial atom velocities conformed to the Maxwell distribution, and the Velocity-Verlet algorithm was employed to calculate the Newton motion integral equation.
