esistivity of p+/n layer is 108.69 /, which is similar to standard process TOPCon cell(100â€“120 /). So the change of Voc is relatively small. The SE structure (p++/n) shows a greater impact on contact resistivity in this study, which affects the Jsc and FF more obviously. The improvement in FF observed in this study is mainly attributed to the use of screen-printed Si paste and the appropriate thermal diffusion process. These processes enhance the quality of the PN junction, create a unifor
