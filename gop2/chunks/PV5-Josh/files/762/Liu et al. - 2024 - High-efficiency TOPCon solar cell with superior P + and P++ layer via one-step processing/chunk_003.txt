C. Using boron-doped silicon paste and boron trichloride as dopants, thermal diffusion experiments were conducted to fabricate the front-field PN junction (p
+
layer) and selective emitter (p
++
layer) by one step. Subsequent processing and performance evaluation were performed on a production line. Experimental findings reveal a decrease in boron diffusion at higher temperatures,
