mly replaced by B atoms in the upper section of the model, creating the diffusion layer, while the Si substrate remained below it. Importantly, this simulation exclusively focuses on the diffusion of B atoms and does not consider the presence of other impurity elements. The simulation region dimensions were set at 61 Å ×61 Å ×88 Å, accommodating a total of 9417 atoms. Periodic boundary conditions were enforced in the transverse (X and Y) di
