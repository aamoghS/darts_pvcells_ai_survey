roduction line. This research contributes to elucidating the mechanism of boron diffusion and offers insights for enhancing the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells.   
1.Introduction In recent years, tunnel oxide passivation contact (TOPCon) solar cells have attracted significant attention among researchers due to their notable efficacy in solar energy conversion [1â€“5]. The diffusion of boron (B) on the front surface of n-type TOPCon cells plays a pivotal role in establishing PN junctions, result
