o Si. At this point, B atoms within Si continue to penetrate deeper over time. Additionally, the depth of B atom diffusion can be inferred from the concentration distribution, with the depth approximately determined based on the concentration range. As depicted in Fig. 7, at temperatures of 750

C, the maximum diffusion depths are measured at 0.236 nm, 0.248 nm, 0.264 nm, and 0.346 nm, respectively. This result substantiates that the depth of the diff
