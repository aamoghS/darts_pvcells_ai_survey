elds an excellent passivation for the polished c-Si surface. However such passivation is strongly degraded for the textured surfaces [6,8]. Besides, the passivation is known to be weakened by the (p) poly-Si/SiO
x 
stack, compared with the (n) poly-Si/SiO
x 
stack for n-type Si wafer [8â€“18]. Therefore, the surface passivation of a textured c-Si wafer for the p-side is crucial for further development of high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells. Recent works already mention the use of front and rear T
