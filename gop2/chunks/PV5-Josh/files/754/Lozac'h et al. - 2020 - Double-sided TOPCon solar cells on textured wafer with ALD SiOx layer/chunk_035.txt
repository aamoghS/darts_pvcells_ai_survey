creases compared to the optimized condition at 50 sccm. The EQE at 200 sccm is lower over a large spectral range from 480 nm up to 1050 nm compared to the optimized condition at 50 sccm. 3.3.SIMS analysis The depth profile of the boron (B) and the hydrogen (H) are analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). These depth profiles are presented after high-T and HPT steps. For comparison, two reference samples are prep
