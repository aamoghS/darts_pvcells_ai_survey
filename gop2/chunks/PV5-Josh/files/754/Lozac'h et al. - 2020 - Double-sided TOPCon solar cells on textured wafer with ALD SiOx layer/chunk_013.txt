 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) with 13.56 MHz radio frequency (RF) power of 250 W at an O

pressure of 15 mTorr for 3 s. The thicknesses are controlled by adjusting the number of ALD cycles and the sources exposure time (3DMAS and O

plasma). For polished surface wafers, the SiO

thickness is monitored by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in situ using a Cauchy model. The c-Si wafers are then transferred into plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system in a down-flow configur
