x 
layer is formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD), which yields excellent conformal coverage over the textured surface. The ALD technique also yields the thickness control of the SiO

layer at atomic level [10]. Here, we particularly concentrate on the surface passivation of the p-side over the textured c-Si. The boron and hydroge
