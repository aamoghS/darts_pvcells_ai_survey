ere also, the pseudo FF (pFF) is consistently slightly lower than the implied FF (iFF) because of the additional passivation losses induced by the ITO and Ag sputtering processes [37]. At 200 sccm, the FF strongly decreases to 0.53 while iFF and pFF remain at 0.84 and 0.81, respectively. This suggests a problem related to the series resistance, and thus the ohmic contacts. Regarding the depth profile of the B
