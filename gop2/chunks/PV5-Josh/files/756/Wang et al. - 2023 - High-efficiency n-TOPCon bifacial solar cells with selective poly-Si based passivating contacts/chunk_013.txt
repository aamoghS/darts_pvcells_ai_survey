n and deep depth can effectively reduce interfacial recombination losses and the contact resistance [10]. Typically, the local-area doping method can be achieved by various technologies, such as wet chemical etch-back [11], ion implantation [12], laser doping [13], screen printing of boron and phosphorus-containing pastes [14], inkjet printing of doping sources [15,16] and thermal diffusions [17]. However, most of these mentioned technologies have some risks in the manufacturing solar cell proce
