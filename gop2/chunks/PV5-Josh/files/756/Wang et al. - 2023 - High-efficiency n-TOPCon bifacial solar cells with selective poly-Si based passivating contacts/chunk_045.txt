-poly-Si profiles measured by ECV with the corresponding SIMS profile reveals that the high amount of P dopants does not contribute to the electrical conductivity of the emitter (Fig. 3). The junction depth of SIMS profiles increases almost in equal proportion compared to ECV profile, about over 0.05
