oc 
values and lifetime of the precursor structure are shown in Fig. S5. The Poly-SE solar cells did not show a good passivation performance, in which iV
oc 
decreased by only 1 mV compared with BKM, and the lifetime decreased by 17

s. Table 5 lists the Iâ€“V parameters of the BKM and Poly-SE solar cells. Poly-SE shows a higher J

of approximately 0.28 mA/cm

compared with BKM, which is attributed to the thin thickness of n
