the dopant profile was defined as the part of the profile that diffused into the c-Si substrate from the surface concentration of 1 ×10

. Whenever t
oxidation 
and t
pressure 
were increased, the “knee-shaped” of the tail ECV profile became steeper. Because the thick oxide layer could prevent P from diffusing into Si with a steep tail ECV profile. Meantime, the quality of the SiO
x 
layer can also influence P diffusion [36]. This result would be conf
