2400 sccm (Fig. 8a). However, when G
POCl3 
drops to 1200 sccm, the J
0 
increases to 6.5 fA/cm
2
. Under the condition of G
POCl3 
=1200 sccm, the flow rate of POCl
3 
is lower compared to other conditions. As a result, the

=5 min, t
pressure 
=5/10/20 min), (b) Condition 2 (t

=5/10/20 min) and (c) Condition 3 (t

=10 min, t
oxidation 
=5/10/20/40 min).
