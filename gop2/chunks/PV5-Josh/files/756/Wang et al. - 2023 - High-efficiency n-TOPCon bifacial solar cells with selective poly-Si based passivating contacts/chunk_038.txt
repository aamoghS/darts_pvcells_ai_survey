d discussion 3.1.The effect of poly-Si based passivating contacts processes 3.1.1.Influence of process parameters on the SiO
x 
layer The variables of the SiO
x 
formation process parameters were the oxidation duration (t
oxidation
)-the constant flow of O
2 
fills the furnace tube for a certain time and the constant pressure duration (t
pressure
)- under the atmospheric pressure (760000 mTorr) and the total O
2 
source, the SiO
x 
layer was deposited on the surface of Si for a certain time. Bot
