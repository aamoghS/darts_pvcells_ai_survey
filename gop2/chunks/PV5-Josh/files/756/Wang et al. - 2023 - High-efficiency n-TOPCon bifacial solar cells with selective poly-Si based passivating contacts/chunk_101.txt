 
process, which was mainly related to the distribution number of O and Si

content on the growth of the SiO
x 
layer. The drive-in temperature of P diffusion process had a stronger influence on J
0 
than the deposition temperature, which was mainly related to the chemical passivation of SiO
x 
layer induced by P- indiffusion into Si at high temperature. Subsequently, we designed different thicknesses for the n

-poly-Si layers. There was a significant positive correlation between
