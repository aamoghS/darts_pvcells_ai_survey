ped poly-Si layer, and dopants from poly-Si layers can diffuse extensively into the c-Si and compromise the passivation quality during this process [34]. Therefore, how to balance the thickness of poly-Si layer and dopant diffusion remains as one of the challenging and critical tasks. After reviewing the previous publications [21,22,30â€“32], the effect of SiO
