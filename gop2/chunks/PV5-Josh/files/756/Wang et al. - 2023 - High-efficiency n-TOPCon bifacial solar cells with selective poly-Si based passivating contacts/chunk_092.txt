f the bulk time of Si wafer. The overall median efficiency increased by 0.12%. These results are basically consistent with the above simulation analysis, the only difference is the less gain of current density, which is mainly owing to the effect of manufacturing process of solar cells (RCA washing, the uniformity of sheet resistance and the line width/height of screen printing,etc.). 3.2.3.Failure analysis To understand the effects of the Poly-SE solar cells, the current loss analysis was carri
