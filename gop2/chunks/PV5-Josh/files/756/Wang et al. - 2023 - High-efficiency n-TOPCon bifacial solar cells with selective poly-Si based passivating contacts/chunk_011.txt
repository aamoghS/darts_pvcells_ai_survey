 difference of the diffusion characteristics of phosphorus and boron. On the one hand, it is different from the diffusivity of phosphorus and boron in poly-Si, SiO
x 
layer and c-Si wafer [5]. On the other hand, SiO
x 
layer can effectively inhibit the diffusion of phosphorus resulting in the formation of shallow doping profiles while boron readily diffuses into SiO
x 
layer leading to an increase in fixed oxide charges and interface trapped charge density, which further results in obtaining hig
