ct density. However, as shown in Fig. 6b, after sintering at 735 ±5 
◦
C, the order of change in iV
oc 
for sintering samples compared to unsintering samples is Poly-annealed (40 mV) >Poly-unannealed (15 mV) >n
+
- poly-Si (8 mV). This high decreased iV
oc 
of Poly-annealed samples are partly owing to in the poor stability at high temperature. However, after phosphorus doping process, n

-poly-Si sample has a small change in iV
oc
, which is related to high temperature doping process fixing
