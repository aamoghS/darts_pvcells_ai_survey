tion [28], ozone oxidation [29] and PECVD [30]. LPCVD has been the primary technology for manufacturing industrial TOPCon cells because of its high throughput and simple process [31,32]. Up to now, most of the thickness values of poly-Si layers are over 70 nm [33]. To further improve the cell performance, the suitable ultra-thin doped poly-Si needs to be developed. Usually, a high thermal annealing step is used to crystallize a-Si layer into a doped poly-Si layer, and dopants from poly-Si layers
