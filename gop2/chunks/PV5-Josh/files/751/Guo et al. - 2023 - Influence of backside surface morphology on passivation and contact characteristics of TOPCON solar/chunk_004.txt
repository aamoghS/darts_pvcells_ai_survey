1.Introduction At present, the efficiency of P-type PERC cells exceeds 23%, which is close to its efficiency limit, so the process of improving efficiency is slowing down [27,50]. Based on the concept of carrier selectivity, the German Institute ISFH analyzed the theoretical limit efficiencies of PERC, HIT, and TOPCon cells of 24.5%, 27.5%, and 28.7%,
