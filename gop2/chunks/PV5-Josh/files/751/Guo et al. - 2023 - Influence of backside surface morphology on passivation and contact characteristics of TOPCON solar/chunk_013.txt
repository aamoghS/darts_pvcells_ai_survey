ces that are not easily covered by layers of glass. In the industrial mass production of solar cells, edge isolation after diffusion is a very important process step. Using laser edge isolation is a solution, but is less used today [28]. Wet chemical etching is the more commonly used method, and during this process, the topography of the backside can also be modified simultaneously to match the backside tunnel oxide/polysilicon fabrication process and screen printed metal contacts.
