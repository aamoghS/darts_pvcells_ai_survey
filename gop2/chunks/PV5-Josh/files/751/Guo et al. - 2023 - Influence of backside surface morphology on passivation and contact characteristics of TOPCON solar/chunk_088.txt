c loss of the alkali-textured sample has a large absorption in the near-infrared band because the rough surface allows more long- wavelength light to enter the heavily doped polysilicon, resulting in greater free carrier absorption. The flat surface of the alkali-polished sample makes the long-wavelength light reflect back to the substrate and be absorbed again, thereby increasing the short-circuit current, but at the same time causing the front surface escape loss to increase. Acid- polished sa
