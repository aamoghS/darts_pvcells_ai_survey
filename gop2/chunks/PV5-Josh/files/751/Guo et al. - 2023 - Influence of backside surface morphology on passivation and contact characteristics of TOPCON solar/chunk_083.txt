ar cells with different morphologies due to the degradation introduced by metal recombination [42]. The influencing factors of short-circuit current are complex. The different carrier recombination of samples with different surface topography may be an important influencing factor. At the same time, there may also be differences in the metal contacts of samples with different morphologies, which may affect the carrier transport. Through the quantum efficiency test, we can simply analyze the loss
