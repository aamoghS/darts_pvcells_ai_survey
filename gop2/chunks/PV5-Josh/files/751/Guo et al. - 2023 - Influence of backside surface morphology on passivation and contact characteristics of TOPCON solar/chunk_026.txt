eflectance. The contact resistance of the metal grid lines of the samples with different morphologies was tested by the transfer-length-method (TLM, GP-4 TEST)to evaluate whether the samples formed good metal contact with the silver paste [16]. Samples of both structures were tested to evaluate the contact resistance under different current transfer modes. The first structure is shown in Fig. 3(a), that is, the backside structure of a standard TOPCON solar cell. Due to the thin thickness of the
