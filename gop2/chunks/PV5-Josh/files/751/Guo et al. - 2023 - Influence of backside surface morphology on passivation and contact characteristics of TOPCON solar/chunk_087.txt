e light to enter the heavily doped polysilicon, while the high reflectivity of the acid-polished and alkali-polished samples allows more incident light to be reflected into the substrate. This ultimately leads to a difference in near-infrared optical absorption, manifested as a decrease in EQE with increasing backside surface roughness. A more intuitive result can be seen from the analysis of the current loss mechanism in Fig. 10(b). The parasitic loss of the alkali-textured sample has a large a
