rformance of the acid- polished sample is always slightly worse than that of the alkali- polished sample, and its contact resistance is significantly better than that of the alkali-polished sample. The flat surface formed by alkali polishing caused severe contact resistance deterioration, which does not seem to be caused by the poor contact between the metal paste and polysilicon, but is more likely to be caused by the thickness of the tunnel oxide layer and the tailing doping concentration in t
