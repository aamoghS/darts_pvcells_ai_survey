ht about by the flat surface. It is difficult to obtain high efficiency due to poor passivation characteristics and the large current loss of alkali-textured samples. We also observed that compared with the iVoc of the precursor sample, the Voc of TOPCon solar cells decreased by 12 mV(Texturing sample), 11 mV(Acid polishing sample), and 10 mV (Alkali polishing sample), respectively. This reveals the difference in the electrical performance of solar cells with different morphologies due to the de
