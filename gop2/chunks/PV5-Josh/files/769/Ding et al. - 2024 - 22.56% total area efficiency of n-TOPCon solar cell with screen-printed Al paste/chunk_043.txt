the sintering process, and led to the grids collapsing, which decreased the aspect ratio. The wafers almost not participate in the reaction, therefore, no silicon diffusion occurred in n
+
-poly-Si, and no voids formed in the Al-Si alloy. As a result, the size of the metal particles in high silicon weight percentage paste (
Fig. 7
(c) (d)) is larger than that of the metal particles in lower silicon weight percentage paste (
Fig. 7
(a) (b)) after sintering.
