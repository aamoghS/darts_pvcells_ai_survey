lement appeared in the area. From 
Fig. 6
, we find that there are many cracks at the edge of the SiN
x 
layer after ablation, which is created by the me
-
chanical stress caused by n
+
-poly-Si and SiN
x
.
Since during laser ablation, the absorption coefficient(

) of n
+
-poly- Si at 355 nm wavelength is several orders of magnitude larger than that of SiN
x 
[19,20]
, the n
+
-poly-Si layer obtained large energy from the laser, resulting in the temperature increased to the melting point of n
