, the peak temperature was 760℃, which is higher than the melting point of Al (660℃). In order to reveal the mechanism of Al-Si contact, we analyzed the Al-Si contact interface on the basis of the Al- Si binary phase diagram (

) 
[21]
.
The formation of ohmic contact is closely related to the Al-Si alloying process 
[22]
. The process can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, Al particles in the paste melt slowly and the silicon from paste or n
