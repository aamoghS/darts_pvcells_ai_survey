eposition (ALD) in the front side of TOPCon cells to passivate the p +emitter, because the AlO
x 
layer has a large amount of negative fixed charge to prevent the recombination of charge carriers. Finally, both sides of the silicon wafers passivated with SiN
x 
(70 nm), which was formed by LPCVD.
To form good contacts between Al paste and silicon wafers, a UV pulse laser ( =355 nm, PWM=10 ps, f =1 MHz, size =40
