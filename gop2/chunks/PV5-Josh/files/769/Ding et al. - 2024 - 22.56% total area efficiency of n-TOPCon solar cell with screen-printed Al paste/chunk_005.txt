of TOPCon solar cells printed with Al paste on the rear side are expected to reach the commercial TOPCon based on Ag paste, which applies laser doping selective emitter technology (SE) and bifacial poly-Si passivation structure.
1.Introduction
The rapid evolution of science and technology accelerates human development of new energy sources. Cz-Si wafers have the advantage of purity and carrier lifetime, so the photovoltaic (PV) devices based on Cz- Si wafers obtain high conversion effi
