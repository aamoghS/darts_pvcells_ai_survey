. The Ag/Al paste and the Al paste with different silicon weight percentages were screen printed on the front side and rear side of TOPCon cells respectively. In order to achieve a good metal–semiconductor contact, all the silicon wafers were sintered in industrial belt furnace, the actual sintering temperature cure is shown in
