owever, the total thickness of passivation layers was about 250 nm, so the TOPCon structure was destroyed obviously, and when the silicon in Al paste over 18 wt%, no BSF was observed at the interface. In addition, many voids (the regions marked with yellow circles) appeared in Al-Si alloy, Lauermann et al.
