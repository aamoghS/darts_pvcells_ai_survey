TOPCon cells (

x 
with chemical passivation, and phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon (n

-poly-Si) with electric field passivation 
[5–7]
, so the excellent passivation mechanism resulting the efficiency record of TOPCon cells refreshed consistently 
[2,6,8–12]
.
Improving efficiency and reducing costs are two key routes to lower the cost per �kWh of TOPCon cells. In the whole TOPCon cells cost of ownership, apart from silicon
