 improvement of interface SiO
x 
and the increase of annealing temperature enhance the absorption of impurities [18,49]; 2) The formation of positive fixed charges (Q
tot
) at higher temperatures reduces the surface recombination of excess carriers (by repelling holes from the surface). The higher the temperature, the higher fixed charge is formed [50]; 3) An appropriate internal diffusion profile can achieve
