ddition of Ar will increase the concentration of atomic O (as shown in Fig. 3), which may lead to the formation of SiO
x 
closer to the stoichiometric configuration of SiO
2
. This PANAO SiO
x 
film contained more Si
4+
component, and higher Si
4+
component may lead to lower interfacial defect state, so the passivation quality is better [18]. Therefore, there are more stable chemical struc

ture and passivation quality under the condition of N

O/Ar=5:2 flow ratio, resulting in higher

and
