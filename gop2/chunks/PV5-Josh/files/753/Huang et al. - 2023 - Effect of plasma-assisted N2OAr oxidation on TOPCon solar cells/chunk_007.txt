ous silicon and quartz tube, which greatly increases the manufacturing cost of the solar cells. Wet chemical oxidation, ozone oxidation and ALD require an additional step to separate preparation of the oxide layer from the doped amorphous silicon layer, which potentially increase the risk of contamination, in addition to requiring additional equipment [25]. Therefore, researchers are focusing on the plasma-assisted oxidation manufacturing method that combines the growth of ultra-thin tunneling S
