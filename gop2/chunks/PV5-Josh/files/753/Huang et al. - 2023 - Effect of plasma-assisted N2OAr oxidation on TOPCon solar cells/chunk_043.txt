er decreases with the increase of Ar flow. The lowest R
sh 
of 42.04 / is obtained when the N
2
O/Ar=5:10 (the thickness of SiO
x 
is 0.82 nm), and the highest R
sh 
of 53.3 / is obtained from a sample of PANO SiO
x 
(N
2
O/Ar=5:0, the thickness of SiO
x 
is 1.76 nm). The decrease of R
sh 
is mainly attributed to the internal diffusion of phosphorus, and as the phosphorus diffuse deeper into the silicon substrate, the lower R
sh 
is obtained. In addition, it also can be found from Fig. 4 (b)
