d by PANAO growths extremely fast at the first tens of seconds, but then gradually decreases with the extension of time until it reaches the self-saturated thickness, which is consistent with the description in literature [25]. In addition, with the increases of RF power, the growth rate is also accelerated, and the self-saturation thickness increases with the increase of RF power. This can be attributed to increasing RF power provides high energy ionized oxygen atoms to penetrate deeper in the
