 In addition, it also can be found from Fig. 4 (b) that the addition of Ar can significantly improve the uniformity of R

tion, which may be the addition of Ar improves the uniformity of PANAO SiO
x 
(as shown in Fig. 2), so that its internal diffusion can be consistent. We conclude that PANAO SiO
x 
(~1.24 nm) at an appropriate N

O/Ar flow ratio (N

O/Ar =5:2) can not only form a strong phosphorus diffusion barrier, but also can form an appropriate SiO
