ar cells (i.e. TOPCon) based on doped polysilicon (n
+
-poly-Si) layer and ultra- thin tunneling SiO
x 
layer are proved to be a promising technology for the next generation of highly efficient industrial silicon solar cells. It will replace the mainstream passivated emitter and back cell (PERC) and double-sided PERC +solar cell, thus attracting more and more attention [1â€“3]. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of lab-type POLO2 IBC and TOPCon cells are up to 26.1% or more [4,5]. A high qu
