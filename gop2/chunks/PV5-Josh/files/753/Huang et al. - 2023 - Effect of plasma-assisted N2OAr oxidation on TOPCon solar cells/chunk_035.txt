 3(a). It can be proved from Fig. 3(b) that when N
2
O/Arâ‰¥5:2, the intensity of atomic O emission lines at 777 nm and 844 nm gradually increase with the decrease of N
2
O/Ar flow ratio. When N
2
O/Ar flow ratio reaches to 5:2, the intensity of atomic O emission lines reach the maximum value, indicating the highest concentration of atomic O has obtained at this flow ratio [29]. As the N
2
O/Ar flow ratio continues decreasing, the in

tensity of atomic O emission line begins to decrease, which
