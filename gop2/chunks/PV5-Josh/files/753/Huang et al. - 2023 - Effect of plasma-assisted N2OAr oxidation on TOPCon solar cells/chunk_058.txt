 phosphorus atoms act as the composite center in silicon substrate which decrease the passivation quality. In addition, the bombardment effect of Ar 
+
on PANAO SiO
x 
film is also enhanced as the Ar flow increased, which leading to the increase of defects in PANAO SiO
x 
film, thus degenerating the passivation quality. The 
 
and iV
oc 
values of the samples with the shallowest doping profile of PANO SiO
x 
after dark annealing are 4000 

s and 729.8 mV, respectively. The possible reasons is:
