O/Ar flow ratio leads to the decrease of N

O concentra

tion and the decrease of O atom concentration per unit volume, which makes the thickness of PANAO SiO
x 
thinner and thinner, and the increasing of defects in the PANAO SiO

film lead to the decreasing of chemical passivation quality. 2) The increase of Ar flow result in the increasing of pinhole density and defects density in PANAO SiO

film, and deteriorating film density, which may originated from the
