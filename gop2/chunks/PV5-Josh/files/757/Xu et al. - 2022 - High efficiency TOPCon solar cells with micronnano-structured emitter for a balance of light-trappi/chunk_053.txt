amount of emitter Auger recombination (J
0e, Auger
) and surface SRH recombination (J
0e, surface
) [41], respectively. Therefore, analyzing the occupation ratio of different recombination channels in NPP emitters can provide guidance for optimizing the preparation process of NPP solar cells. Based on the measured ECV profiles and J
0 
extraction values, we disassemble the J
0e 
of NPP emitters and conventional micron-pyramid emitters into J
0e, auger 
and J
0e, surface 
using ENDA 2 software [4
