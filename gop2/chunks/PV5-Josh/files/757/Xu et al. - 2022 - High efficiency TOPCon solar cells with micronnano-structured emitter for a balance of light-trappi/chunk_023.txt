d process. It is noteworthy that in view of the extensive number of recombination caused by NPP structures, the boron diffusion process and surface passivation technique were optimized and discussed on baseline process. 2.3.Characterization Morphologies and feature sizes of NPP structures were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU5000). The reflectance spectra of silicon wafers and solar cells were determined by hemi
