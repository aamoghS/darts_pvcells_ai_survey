of 600 W showed the highest average PCE (23.55%) compared with that of 100 W (23.48%), 300 W (23.45%) and conventional cells (23.37%). The high PCE of NPP cells at the P
RF 
of 600 W is derived from the appropriate surface morphology and feature size, which realizes a tradeoff between optical gain and recombination loss associated with NPP structures, that
