ith mainstream passivated emitter and rear solar cells (PERC) mass production, and a maximum theoretical PCE up to 28.7%, which are promising as an alternative to next-generation solar cell technology [2]. Unfortunately, the front-side optical reflection loss still accounts for a large portion of power loss for bifacial TOPCon solar cells, caused by conventional micron-pyramid texture with poor short-wavelength absorption [3,4]. Hence, researchers put forward and developed various advanced light
