ucture. The equivalent medium layer with graded refractive index appeared on NPP textures makes the absorption of almost all incident light independent of the wavelength and angle. However, serious Auger recombination and surface recombination associated with NPP structure is detrimental to emitter passivation, usually counteracting the photocurrent gain. To identify an appropriate balance of light-trapping and surface passivation, we investigate the impact of different radio-frequency power (P
