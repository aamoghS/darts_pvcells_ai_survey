tions. The core of the TOPCon comprises an ultra-thin oxide layer and a heavily doped polycrystalline silicon layer, which enables selective carrier transport, resulting in a combination of outstanding passivation quality and contact performance [6â€“8]. Regrettably, the application of this passivating contact on the solar cell front side presents challenges due to its intense lig
