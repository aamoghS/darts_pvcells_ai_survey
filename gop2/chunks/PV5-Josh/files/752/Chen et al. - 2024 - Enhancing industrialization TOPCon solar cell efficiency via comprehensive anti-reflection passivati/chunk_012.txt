 foundation, a one-step plasma oxidation process was implemented prior to depositing SiN

on AlO
x
. The purpose of this process was to eliminate oxygen vacancy defects within the AlO
x 
layer, thus improving its passivating properties. For the rear passivation, a combination of three layers of silicon nitride with different n is used to achieve both passivation and optical performance. As a further optimization, a NH

plasma treatment was introduced to increase the hydrogen content before e
