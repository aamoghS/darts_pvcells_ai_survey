bond ratio, which can be attributed to the vigorous high-energy plasma bombardment, causing the rupture of O–H bonds. Consequently, the released Al and O from plasma reconfigure to form additional O–Al–O bonds, that aids in mitigating oxygen vacancy defects. Simultaneously, the liberated hydrogen from the fractured O–H bonds permeates into both the AlO

/Si interface [23]. The collective impact plays a pivotal role in diminishing the density of defect states on the S
