nt in passivation quality contributes to a notable V

enhancement of approximately 1.1 mV. Importantly, there are no sig

nificant differences observed in the performance of I
sc 
and FF. This outcome aligns with the observation that PH treatment exerts minimal influence on the thickness and refractive index of the final SiN
x 
film, as determined by ellipsometry analysis. Finally, TOPCon solar cells achieve ~0.07% average conversion efficiency gain by PH processing. 4.Conclusions In conclus
