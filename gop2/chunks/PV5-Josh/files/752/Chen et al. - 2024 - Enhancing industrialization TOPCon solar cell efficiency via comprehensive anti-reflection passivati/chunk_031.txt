geneity of the passivation had been significantly improved. The final average electrical performance comparisons of TOPCon solar cells are shown in Table 2. The addition of extra PO treatment to the deposition process of the front surface passivation film helps the TOPCon solar cell to obtain an average V
oc 
gain of 1.3 mV. In addition, the fill factor (FF) is also obtaining a slight rise. There are two possible reasons for this, one is the higher V
oc 
due to better surface passiva
