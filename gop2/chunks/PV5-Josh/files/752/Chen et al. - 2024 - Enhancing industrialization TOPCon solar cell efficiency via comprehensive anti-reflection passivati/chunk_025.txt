tra within the X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) results, as displayed in Fig. 2a. Prior to the peak fitting process, the Shirley background, accounting for inelastically scattered electrons, was eliminated. From the O 1s peak, peaks at ~530.8 eV and ~532.9 eV were meticulously deconvoluted. These correspond to the O–Al–O bands of Al
