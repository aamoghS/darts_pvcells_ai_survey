absorption losses, rear-side films must be highly transparent, while providing excellent transport and superior passivation for the selected charge carrier. To minimize absorption loss, we report a novel rear side- area passivating electron contact that improves the transparency by replacing a part of the doped poly-Si layer. The novel contact structure includes a thin thermally grown SiO
