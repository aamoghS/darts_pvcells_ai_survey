uted to the local disruption of the tunnel oxide layer. This disruption is not easy to observe through TEM and XPS measurements due to the fine area analysis on the atomic scale. A bifacial structure such as used for the QSSPC measurement was employed. Substantial improvements in passivation characteristics were observed after PDA when the nc-SiO
