s deposition temperatures. The novelty of our results arose from different fabrication methods and treatment steps. Josua et al. used a chemical process for oxidation and a thin nc-SiO
x 
layer, thus requiring different annealing times and temperatures. In this study, we optimized the thickness of evaluated layers, N
2 
atmosphere annealing, and FGA temperature and time. To evaluate the passivation contact properties, maximum i-V
oc 
values and low interface trap density (D
it
) were examined as
