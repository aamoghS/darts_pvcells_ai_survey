x 
on different annealing temperature The HRTEM image of the ultrathin SiO
2 
layer capped with the nc- SiO
x 
layer observed at a scale of 1 nm is shown in Fig. 2. The thickness of this layer was recorded as 1.5 nm. The SiO
2 
layer with a thickness greater than 1.6 nm has previously been reported to exhibit poor passivation properties due to the reduced degree of dopant diffusion f
