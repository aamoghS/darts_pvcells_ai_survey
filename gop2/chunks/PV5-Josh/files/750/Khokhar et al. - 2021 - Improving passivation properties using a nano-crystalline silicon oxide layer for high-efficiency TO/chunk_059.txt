ow interface trap density (D

) were examined as they permit selective carrier transport by a particular SiO
x 
tunnel layer. The D
it 
of the tunnel oxide layer was quantitatively assessed by C-V measurement. The D

was studied to evaluate the effect of SiO
x 
and nc-SiO

quality on surface passivation. D

value, the higher the i-V
