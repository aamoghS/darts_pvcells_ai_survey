/Ar plasma using the aluminum pads as an etching mask, and the samples were measured after each etch process by TLM. The plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system of (SNTEK company) with a frequency of 13.56 MHz and thermal furnace of EM TECH company are used during the experiment. Structural characteristics were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Ramboss 500i, Dongwoo
