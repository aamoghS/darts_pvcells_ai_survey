. Moreover, the temperature stability of passivation is improved owing to the presence of a thermally grown SiO
2 
layer, resulting in a broad thermal processing window. A wide bandgap material, nc-SiO
x
, was introduced to reduce optical absorption. The optical and electrical characteristics could be varied by changing the oxygen content. The conductive properties of the n-doped nc-SiO
x 
were found at low oxygen concentrations with phosphorus doping. The annealing process is an important proce
