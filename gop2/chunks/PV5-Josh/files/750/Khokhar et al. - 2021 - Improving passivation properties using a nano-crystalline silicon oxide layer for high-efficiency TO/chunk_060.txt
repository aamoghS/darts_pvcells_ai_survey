/eV was achieved due to the H passivation process means FGA treatment. It is thought that dangling silicon bonds in the interface and tunnel oxide layer were passivated by hydrogen. To improve the passivation quality of the tunnel oxide layer, it is important to control the properties and stoichiometry of the tunnel oxide layer. An i-V
