digitated back contact (IBC) devices without oxygen alloying [15â€“21]. With exceptional passivating junction characteristics for the front side contact solar cell, the rear side contacting scheme is the factor limiting efficiency. To outspread the application of passivating contacts for the rear side, additional requirements must be met. To overcome parasitic
