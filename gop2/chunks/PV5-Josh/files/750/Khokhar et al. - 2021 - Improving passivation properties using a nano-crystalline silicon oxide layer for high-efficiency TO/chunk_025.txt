es due to the reduced degree of dopant diffusion from nc-SiO
x 
to the c-Si wafer owing to the thicker SiO
2 
layer [27]. The structural analyses of such nc-SiO
x 
layers using Raman spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 3a and b. Crystalline volume factor (X

) as shown in Fig. 3c was derived from the data using the relation X

518, 519 
and I
