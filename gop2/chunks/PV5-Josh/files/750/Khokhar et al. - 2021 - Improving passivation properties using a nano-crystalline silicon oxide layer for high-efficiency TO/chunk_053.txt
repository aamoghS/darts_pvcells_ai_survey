C. Thus, this is considered indirect evidence of local disruption of the tunnel oxide layer. Based on the total resistance, the resistivity of the tunnel oxide layer was deducted to separate the layers of the sample structure by considering the thickness and sheet resistance measurements of the nc-SiOx layer and the sub
