mited emitters‚Äù concept (del Alamo and Swanson,1984), which are less sensitive to bulk recombination because the hole concentration in the most highly doped layers of the emitters, near the surface where the lifetime is very degraded and become short. Therefore, the hole recombination rate is small too. The effect of increasing the doping level is to reduce J
