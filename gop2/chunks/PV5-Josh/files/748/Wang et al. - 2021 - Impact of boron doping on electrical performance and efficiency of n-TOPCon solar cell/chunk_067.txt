t al., 2016), the heavy increase in J
0e, metal 
started until the tips reached depths where the B-doped concentration was lower than approximately 10
18 
atoms/cm
3 
for all profiles. Therefore, we inferred that J
0e, metal 
is not significantly affected at depths of greater than 0.63 

m when a dopant concentration was equal to 10
18 
atoms/cm
3
. This is because the effect of the peak concentration on J
0e, metal 
in shallow emitter D1 and D2 is more significant than that in deep emitter D3.
