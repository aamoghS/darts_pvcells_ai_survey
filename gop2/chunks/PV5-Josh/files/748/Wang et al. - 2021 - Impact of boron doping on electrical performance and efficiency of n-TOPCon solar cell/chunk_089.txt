eep junction are required. 3.6.Failure analysis A current loss was used to be discussed in order to understand the effects of the B-doped profile. The simulated optical reflectance was in agreement with the results of the experimental reflection without any adjustments (Fig. 10); we did not find any significant optical reflection for those samples. The primary difference of IQE for emitters D1–D3 (Fig. 10a-c) and N1–N2 (Fig. 10d-e) occurred at short wavelengths <550 nm; their blue responses
