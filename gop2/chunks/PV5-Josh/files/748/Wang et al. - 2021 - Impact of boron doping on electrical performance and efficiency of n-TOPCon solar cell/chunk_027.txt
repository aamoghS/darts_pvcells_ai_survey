 of n-Topcon solar cells, which consists of screen-printed metallic contacts on both sides fabricated from 158.75 mm ×158.75 mm ×0.17 mm Cz–Si wafers through an industrial-type process with the fixed Ag–Al/Ag pastes. To this end, the peak concentration/junction depth of the B- doped profile was experimentally investigated with respect to their in
