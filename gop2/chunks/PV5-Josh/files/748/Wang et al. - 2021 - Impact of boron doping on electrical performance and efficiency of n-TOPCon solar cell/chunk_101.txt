 I–V parameters of the solar cell (J
sc
, V
oc
, FF and E
ff
) were investigated as functions of the peak concentration and junction depth of B-doped profile. The best solar cell with a high E
ff 
(23.34%), V
oc 
(702 mV), and J
sc 
(41.01 mA/cm
2
) was obtained using the B-doped profile with junction depth of 0.8 

m and the peak concentration of 1.94 ×10
19 
atoms/cm

. The junction depth has a stronger influence on the V
oc 
than the peak concentration. A low peak concentration and deep
