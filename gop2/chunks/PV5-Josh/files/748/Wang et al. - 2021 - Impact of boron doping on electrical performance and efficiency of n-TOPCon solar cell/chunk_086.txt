tion activity in the cell (J
0e,total
) was calculated by using the measured values of J
0e,passivated 
and J
0e,metal 
according to equation (1). The saturation current density of the bulk (J
0,bulk
) was estimated from testing, about 8 fA/cm
2
. The cell V
oc 
was calculated from J
0e,total 
using an ideal one-diode model and compared against the measured V
oc
. A detailed calculation of the total J
0e,total 
and comparison of the calculated and measured V
oc 
values are shown in Table 4. The
