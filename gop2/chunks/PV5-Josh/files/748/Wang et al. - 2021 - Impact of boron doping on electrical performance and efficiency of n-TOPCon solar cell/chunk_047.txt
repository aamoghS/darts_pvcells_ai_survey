The microstructure and morphology of the previously metallized areas after removing the metal paste, the glass layer, and the dielectric passivation layer stack by a wet-chemical etching process were measured by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, Quanta FEG 250, FEI). The specific contact resistance (
