t short wavelengths <550 nm; their blue responses were significantly degraded by the higher peak concentration and deep junction of the B-doped profile. Especially, the IQE for emitter N2 with 1.0

are decreased by increasing the peak concentration and junction depth of the B-doped profile, owing to the high recombination on the front sur
