; Lago et al., 2010; Fritz et al., 2016a). This ultimately results in the loss of conversion efficiency. A deep junction doping profile will be required to reduce the metallization-induced recombination losses (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, another major challenge to improve the efficiency is to achieve a high surface doping concentration with a low contact resistance to screen- printed Ag/Al metallization while maintaining highly homogenous emitter sheet resistance to minimize the emitter satura
