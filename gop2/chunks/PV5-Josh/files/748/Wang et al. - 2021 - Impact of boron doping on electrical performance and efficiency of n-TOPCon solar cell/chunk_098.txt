rmity loss,” which mainly originates from the difference in current density between a high-quality spot on the wafer and the average of the wafer. In this study, the main reason for this loss was that the uniformity of front passivation on the lower peak concentration and shallow junction were difficult to be controlled. For emitters D2, D3 and N1, besides these three losses, an additional loss exists, called “NIR parasitic absorb,” which occurs due to unremoved the wraparound of rear B la
