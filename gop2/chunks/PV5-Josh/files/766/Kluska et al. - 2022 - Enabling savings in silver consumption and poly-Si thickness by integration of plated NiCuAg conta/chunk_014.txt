easing laser pulse energy similar to Arya et al. [9]. Each processing group featured at least 10 solar cells per metallization. The fabricated solar cells were characterized using an industrial type IV flasher with a non reflective chuck and a grid neglecting contacting unit (see appendix A of [12]). After IV testing laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO) [13] was applied to the solar cells. During the process a laser scans the over the cells front side which causes a very high local injecti
