 supplied by Rena Technologies GmbH were used to plate a stack of Ni (~0.5 

m)/Cu(5–10 

m)/Ag(<0.5 

m). The nickel (Nimate PV) and copper (Cupracid PV 5–2) electrolyte used in this experiment were supplied by Atotech Group. Plating on the n-type TOPCon and p-type emitter side was performed with light-induced plating (current controlled) and forward bias plating (current controlled), respectively. The set current density for nickel deposition was 2.5 A/dm

(front side) and 2.2 A/dm
