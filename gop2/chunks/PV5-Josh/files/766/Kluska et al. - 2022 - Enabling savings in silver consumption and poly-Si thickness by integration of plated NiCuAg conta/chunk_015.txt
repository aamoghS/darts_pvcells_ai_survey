 front side which causes a very high local injection of charge carriers. At the same time a negative bias voltage is applied to the contacts of the cell. The high injection and the negative bias voltage cause high current densities through the contact interface, which are responsible for contact formation and hence improve the metal semiconductor contact of the cells. The champion solar cells were externally characterized at Fraunhofer ISE Callab using calibrated IV measurements with a reflectiv
