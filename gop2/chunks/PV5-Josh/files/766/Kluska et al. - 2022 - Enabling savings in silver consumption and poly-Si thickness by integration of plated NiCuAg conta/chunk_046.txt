ame time achieve high cell efficiencies of up to 24%. Furthermore, the application of UV-ps LCO allows to achieve low contact recombination on the TOPCon rear side. This held to be true even for reduced poly-Si thickness down to 60 nm. A maximum V
oc 
of up to 708 mV was achieved on 60 nm poly-Si using a plated metallization approach. A detailed study of the rear side contact recombination revealed the potential to further reduce the poly-Si thickness on the TOPCon rear side for the case of plat
