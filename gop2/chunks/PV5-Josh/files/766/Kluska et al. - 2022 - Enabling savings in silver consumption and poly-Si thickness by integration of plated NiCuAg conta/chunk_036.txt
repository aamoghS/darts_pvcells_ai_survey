. Series resistance (R
s
) characterization showed that the R
s 
could be reduced by about 0.3 cm
2 
after LECO with lower variation in R
s
. No significant changes in grid resistance were measured before and after LECO. The detailed analysis of the V
oc
, and series resistance (R
s
) change of each cell after LECO is presented in Fig. 6. A decrease in R
s 
correlates to a slight decrease in V
oc
. The same is true for decreased R

correlating to slight decrease i
