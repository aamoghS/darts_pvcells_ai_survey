low. However, the applicable range of LCO pulse energies with no significant iV
oc 
degradation is for all poly-Si thicknesses still well above the ablation threshold. The applied LCO pulse energy of the solar cells in Fig. 3 is for all poly-Si thickness in a region of no significant iV
oc 
reduction. The LCO design of the PL test structures featured a contact fraction of ~1%. The iV
oc 
degradation in Fig. 3 in the range of ~1â€“8 mV correlates to a saturation current density of the rear side c
