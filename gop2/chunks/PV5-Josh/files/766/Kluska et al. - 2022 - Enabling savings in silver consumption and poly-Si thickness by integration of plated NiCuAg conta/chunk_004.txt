n) solar cell in industry. State-of-the-art n-type solar cell designs with printed metal contacts typically require pastes on front and rear side with high silver content. Laser structured and plated Ni/Cu contacts are an industrially feasible alternative to significantly reduce silver consumption for p- or n- type silicon solar cell designs. Recent works demonstrated successful integration of plated contacts for PERC [3], SHJ [4], PERT [5] and TOPCon. Gr√ºbel et al. [6,7] introduced a process s
