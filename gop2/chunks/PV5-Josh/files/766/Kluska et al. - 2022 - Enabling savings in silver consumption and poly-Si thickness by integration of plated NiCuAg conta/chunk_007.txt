mately 60 nm. Furthermore, the aim of this work is to characterize the impact of the laser contact opening on the contact recombination of TOPCon rear side with reduced poly-Si thickness and develop strategies to ensure low contact resistances and reliable contact adhesion even on planarized surfaces. 2.Experimental The TOPCon precursors used in this work were processed in an in
