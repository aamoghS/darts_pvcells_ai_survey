eading towards a multi terawatt production capacity in the next decade. Especially, silver for solar cell metallization turns out to be one of the critical materials in terms of availability and material costs [1,2]. The dependency on silver will even increase in an anticipated technology evolution from p-type passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) to n-type solar cell concepts such as het
