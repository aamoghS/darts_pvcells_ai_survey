It can be clearly seen that there are two 
dominant loss mechanisms. The resistive loss incurred by the 
grid fingers has a share of ~32% of the total loss. The aggregate 
loss 
due to recombination in the emitter (including contacted 
regions) takes a similar share of ~34% of the total energy loss. 
Hence, the simulation reveals that
