cells with homogeneous boron emitter and 
passivating rear contact were realized. 
Firstly, t
he impact of laser 
ablation on the 
J
0
 
was studied and it was found that a low laser 
power has to be used in order to contain crystal damage. Still, the 
Si crys
tal was damaged during LCO, which resulted in a 
significant increase of the recombination current (
J
0
) at the metal 
front contacts. Secondly, solar cells featuring NiCu plated front 
metallization were realized and analyzed.
