abs
 
can be 
attributed to 
the grid resistance.
 
This is supported by the 
measurement of the grid resistance (busbar to busbar) which 
revealed a resistance of 80
 
mΩ, amounting to approx. one third 
of 
R
S
.
 
The 
J
sc
 
was 40.8
 
mA/cm².
 
Due to a metal coverage of ~2%, 
the main 
J
sc
 
loss can be attributed to shading by the front metal 
grid.
 
The influence of ghost plating was present but 
is
 
yet to be 
quantified.
 
In total an efficiency of 22.9% was measured.
