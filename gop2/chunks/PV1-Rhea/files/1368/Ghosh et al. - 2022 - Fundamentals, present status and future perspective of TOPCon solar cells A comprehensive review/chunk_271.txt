ous doped front emitter may be a solution to enhance the efficiency potential of these TOPCon upgraded p-PERC solar cells. Loss analysis Richter et al. investigated the various loss mechanisms involved in the high efficiency (25.8%) TOPCon solar cells to realize the further scope of improvement in the cell performance [108]. With the help of Quokka3 simulation tool and FELA (free energy loss analysis) technique, it was observed that surface recombination losses at front emitter and Auger recombi
