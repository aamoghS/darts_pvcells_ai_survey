enon may be caused by the effusion of hydrogen from a-Si:H layers. However, mini

mization of this phenomenon may be realized by controlling the surface morphology and annealing profile which in turn provide adequate time and path for the escape of hydrogen atoms. As a result, an implied V

C. On the other hand, degradation in the passivating quality of the passivated contacts for
