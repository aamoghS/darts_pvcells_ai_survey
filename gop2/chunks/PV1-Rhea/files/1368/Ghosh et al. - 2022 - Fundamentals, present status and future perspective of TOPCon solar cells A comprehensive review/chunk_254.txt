oc 
and lesser J
sc 
in comparison with standard reference cells (featured BBr

tube furnace emitters) were also explored. The loss in V
oc 
may be attributed to the degradation of the effective minority carrier lifetime. Now, the deterioration of carrier lifetime was ascribed to the increment of RVD surface dopant concen
-
tration and dopant depth. On the other hand, fla
