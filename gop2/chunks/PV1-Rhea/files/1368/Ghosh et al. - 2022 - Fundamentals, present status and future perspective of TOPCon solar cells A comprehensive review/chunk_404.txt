metal oxides with low work function may serve the purpose of contact layers to n-TOPCon where as dopant free high work function metal oxides such as MoO

may be used as contact layers to p-TOPCon [20]. Secondly, use of these transition metal oxides must provide excellent surface passivation quality, minimum contact re

sistivity and high thermal stability. Thirdly, suitable deposition method has to be adapted so that the uniformity and integrity of ultra-thin oxide layers do not get al
