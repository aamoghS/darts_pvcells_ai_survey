junction solar cells. Finally, prior to conclusion, the future scope of works with possible challenges and their probable solutions have been analyzed. 2.Evolution of TOPCon solar cell and its importance in PV industries As stated earlier that the passivated contact based solar cells will gain the highest market share in the near future. Consequently, the current researches in solar cell architectures are primarily focusing on PERC and TOPCon solar cells. However, due to the challeng
