and FF =70.41% was obtained. To minimize the effect of poly-silicon wrap-around and to increase the value of shunt resistance (R

), two methods namely, laser isolation process (laser wavelength: 540 nm) and chemical etching process were adopted. Laser isolation process was carried out after the metallization where as in alkaline solution etching process, samples were immersed in KOH solution in between the N
