Si:H layer (40â€“120 nm) were varied to facilitate the surface passsivation quality of n-type TOPCon structure [66]. The study revealed that RTA method took very low time of about 15 min for the whole crystallization process where as more than 60 min was needed in conventional tube furnace annealing process for the same purpose. Besides, no blistering during the thermal treatment was observed when the thickness of a-Si:H layer was less than 40 nm. But the passivation quality provided by RTA proc
