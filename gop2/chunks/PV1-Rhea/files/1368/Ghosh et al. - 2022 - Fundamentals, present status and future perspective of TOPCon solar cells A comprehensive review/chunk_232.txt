hus observed in both the cases. However, the solar cells featuring ITO/Ag stack as the rear side metallic contact suffered from obtaining higher FF value due to the impact of high value of series resistance. In contrast, FFs above 82% was realized for the solar cells which contained only Ag layer at the back. Apart from Feldmann et al., Tutsch et al. also investigated the impact of inserting ITO layer in between the doped poly-Si layer and metal contacts [90]. The study revealed that lightly dop
