uthors performed a simulation study to optimize the base material, front emitter and light trapping mechanisms. The study demonstrated that increment in base resistivity from 1 -cm to 10 -cm resulted in an efficiency improvement irrespective of the wafer thickness, for an example an efficiency increment of 0.2%
