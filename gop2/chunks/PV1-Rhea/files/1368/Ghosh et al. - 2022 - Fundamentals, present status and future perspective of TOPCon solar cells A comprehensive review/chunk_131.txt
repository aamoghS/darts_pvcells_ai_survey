tions apart from the lateral homogeneous tunneling at carrier selective passivated poly-Si/c-Si junctions [6]. Firstly, excellent passivation quality was realized at poly-Si/c-Si junctions irrespective of the tunneling barrier height ratio for the charge carriers. Secondly, TEM study demonstrated the change in the structural properties such as local thickness reduction, formation of pinhole
