es at the rear side of the cell were found to be less significant due to the excellent surface passivation provided by the TOPCon structure. The contribution of different electrical loss mechanisms occurring inside the champion TOPCon solar cells was depicted in Fig. 19. On the other hand, the study revealed that the escape reflection and IR parasitic absorption were the major part of the optical losses. Hence, to maximize the power output, the authors performed a simulation study to optimize th
