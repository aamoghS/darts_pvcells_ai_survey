ructure might be another suitable approach to restrain the effect of blistering [78]. Incorporation of carbon contents in poly-Si matrix (i) reduced the crystallization fraction of doped poly-Si layer; (ii) improved the bond strengths by forming stronger C-Si bonds; and (iii) formed C-H bonds which in turn reduced the possibility of H effusion from the passivated contacts during high temperature thermal treatment. In this way, carbon doped poly-Si layer could reduce the effect of blistering as w
