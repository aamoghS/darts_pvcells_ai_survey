Besides, Lozac’h and Nunomura also carried out a comparative study on the performance of both sided TOPCon solar cells fabricated on polished (<100>and <111>oriented) and pyramid textured n-type FZ Si wafers, respectively [30]. The study revealed that the optimized thickness value of ALD coated ultra-thin SiO
