r cells with its merits and demerits. Besides, we shall observe how the use of TOPCon structure as rear emitter in p-type c-Si solar cells may eliminate the need of additional FSF (front surface field) layer without affecting the conversion efficiency by a considerable margin. The major part of this article is comprised of careful discussion on various research activities performed by researchers to improve the quality of ultra-thin SiO
