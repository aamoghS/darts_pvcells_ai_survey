emitter and enhancement of optical confinement of the incident light into the absorbing layers may lead to fabricate TOPCon solar cells with the power conversion efficiency of well above 25%. Eventually, in 2015, Glunz et al. announced about the development of TOPCon solar cells with a conversion efficiency of 25.1% (V
