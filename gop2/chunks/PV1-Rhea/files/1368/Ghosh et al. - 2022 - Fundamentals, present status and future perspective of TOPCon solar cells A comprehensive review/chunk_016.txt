lion/GW whereas the same for PERC and TOPCon solar cell is nearly RMB 150â€“200 million/GW and RMB 250 million/GW [18]. Besides, higher depreciated costs and use of expensive low temperature treated silver paste are major bottlenecks for wide commercialization of the SHJ solar cells. According to the ITRPV 2021 report, the solar photovoltaics market is being exclusivel
