oxide layer is an important parameter to consider always because the oxide layer must maintain its stoichiometry (the oxidation state of Si must be close to Si
4+
) during the thermal treatment of doped poly-Si layer for its dopant activation and crystallization purpose. Thermal oxide grown in LPCVD tube is mostly used for the mass production of TOPCon solar cells [117,118â€“123,127]. The comparative analysis of the various routes
