vation. Appling the concept of interdigitated back contact into HIT solar cells, in 2014 Sharp first developed HBC (Heterojunction Back Contact) solar cells with a conversion efficiency of 25.1% [9]. By applying the similar concept Panasonic developed HBC solar cells with a conversion efficiency of 25.6% (V
