 One of the major problems associated with the PERC solar cells is the rear side contact openings as the rear contact in PERC solar cell is realized by opening groves in the passivating layers [5]. Therefore, bulk Si layer may get damaged during this opening process. Additionally, the photo-generated current has to flow the longer path due to the presence of localized metallic contacts. On the other hand, as the conventional monofacial TOPCon solar cells comprise of full area rear side metallic
