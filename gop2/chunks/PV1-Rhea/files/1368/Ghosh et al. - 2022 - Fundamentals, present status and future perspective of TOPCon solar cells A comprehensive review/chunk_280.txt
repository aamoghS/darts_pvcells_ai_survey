lifetime, the carrier selectivity and the contact resistivity of the poly-Si passivated contact was made for improving the cell performances. Additionally, the energy loss of the p-type passivated contact solar cells was realized by FELA (free energy loss analysis) technique. The study revealed that the solar cells featuring p-type passivated contact as BSF are more beneficial when the bulk carrier lifetime is less than 350 Âµs. Eventually, the pathway towards achieving a power conversion effici
