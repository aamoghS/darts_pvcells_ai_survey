mally grown ultra-thin tunnel oxide layer by means of industrial scalable low frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. Here, the front contacts were also realized by laser contact opening (LCO) process and subsequent plating of NiCuAg. However, a conversion efficiency of 24.5
