 was noticed due to having lower series resistance and higher carrier density. However, further explorations are still required as the best cell featured a conversion efficiency of 13.5%. Recently, in 2020, Wilkes et al. claimed that the use of novel pulsed-laser processing method instead of high temperature annealing treatment for the dopant activation and crystallization of phosphorous doped a-Si:H layer in TOPCon solar cell structure provided excellent surface passivation quality [72].
