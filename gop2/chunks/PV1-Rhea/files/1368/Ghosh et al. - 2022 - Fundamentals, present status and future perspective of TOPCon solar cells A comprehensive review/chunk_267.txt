of 742 mV and a FF of 86%. The authors also investigated the effect on the surface passivation properties and carrier transport due to presence of defective transition layer (DTL) in between ultra-thin tunnel oxide layer and electron selective collection (ESC) layer. Therefore, selection of suitable electron selective collection (ESC) layer, minimizing the defects in the ultra-thin oxide layer, and reducing the thickness and defect density of the defective transition layer were recommended to im
