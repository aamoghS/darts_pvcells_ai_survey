any advantages such as precise dose control, ability of localized doping i.e. controllability of the penetration depth of the dopant atoms into the base material etc. [60â€“63]. For an example, Feldmann et al. investigated the influential effect of using low energy ion implantation technique for the doping purpose of PECVD coated 20 nm thick undoped amorphous silicon layer [60]. In essence, the study was conducted to correlate the impact of ion energy and ion dose on the passivation quality of b
