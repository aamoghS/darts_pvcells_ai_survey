ost same (17.9% for amorphous silicon emitter and 17.8% for semi-crystalline silicon emitter). Nevertheless, improvement in the passivation quality of p-contact may lead to maximize the power conversion efficiency. In addition, double-sided contact solar cells with n-TOPCon on textured front side and p-TOPCon on planar back side were also devel
