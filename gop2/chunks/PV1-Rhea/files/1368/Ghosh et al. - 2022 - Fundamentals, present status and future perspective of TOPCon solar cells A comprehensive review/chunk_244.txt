timized wisely in order to preserve a proper balance in between the contact properties and the surface passivation quality [80]. Furthermore, the design of doped poly-Si layer should be kept in such a way so that the penetration of rear side metallic paste into doped poly-Si layer can be inhibited during the screen printing and paste firing process so that the passivation quality of the TOPCon structure can be maintained [80]. To preserve the passivation quality of the TOPCon structure even afte
