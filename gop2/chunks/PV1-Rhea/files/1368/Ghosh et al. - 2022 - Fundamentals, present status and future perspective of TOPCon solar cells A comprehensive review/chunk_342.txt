Heraeus, the renowned paste making enterprise has recently announced that their “SOL7300 Pro” (Ag) paste may be very fruitful for realizing the metallization (especially rear side) of TOPCon solar cells as it offers low metal induced recombination, low contact resistivity even when fired at relatively low temperatures, excellent green strength and low possibility of damage to the ultra-thin poly-Si layer etc. [130]. However, the consumption of Ag paste needs to be
