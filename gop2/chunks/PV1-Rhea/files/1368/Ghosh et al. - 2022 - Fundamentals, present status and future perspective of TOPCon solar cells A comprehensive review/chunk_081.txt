Fig. 8.TEM images of (a) (p) a-Si:H/SiOx on polished surface as deposited, (b) (p) poly-Si/SiOx on polished surface after high-T annealing. Diffraction patterns of (c) the (p) poly-Si compared to d) the bulk-Si by nano beam diffraction (NBD). TEM images of (e) (p) poly-Si/SiOx on textured surface after high-T annealing, (f) magnification of (e). (g) Plane view of the textured surface [29].
