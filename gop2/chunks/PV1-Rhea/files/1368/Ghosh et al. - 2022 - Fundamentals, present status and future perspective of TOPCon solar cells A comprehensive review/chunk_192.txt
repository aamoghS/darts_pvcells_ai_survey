f laser process and the thickness of a-Si:H layer may lead to maximize the interfacial passivation quality. 6.2.2.Protecting the ultra-thin SiO
x 
tunneling layer from damages/ blistering during the development of poly-Si layer Another major problem associated with the development of TOPCon structure is the blister formation [73,74]. Blisters are generally formed due to the accumulation of hydrogen content at the interface of SiO
x 
and doped a-Si:H layer. This accumulation of hydrogen takes pla
