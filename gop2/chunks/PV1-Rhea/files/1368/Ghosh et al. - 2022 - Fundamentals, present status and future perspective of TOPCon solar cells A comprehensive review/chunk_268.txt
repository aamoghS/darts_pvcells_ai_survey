 defective transition layer were recommended to improve the power conversion efficiency of TOPCon solar cells featuring electron selective collection (ESC) layer at back. Recently, with the help of Sentaurus 2D simulation tool, Sugiura et al. demonstrated that n-type TOPCon solar cells outperformed the p- type TOPCon solar cells with 15% larger current density owing to featuring higher bulk lifetime, lower defect density, smaller minority carrier tunnelling through ultra-thin tunnel oxide layers
