 loss analysis (FELA), the authors observed that significant improvement in the power conversion efficiency may be realized by minimizing mainly the emitter recombination losses and resistive losses. In addition, the authors reported about the development of n-type bifacial TOPCon modules with an output power of 331 W and 392 W featuring 60 cells and 72 cells, respectively where these high efficiency modules showed an average bifaciality of 85%, a temperature coefficient of -0.32%/K and quite lo
