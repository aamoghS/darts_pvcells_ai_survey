 Sentaurus simulation results revealed that by improving the wafer quality, optimizing the metal contacts design, and further reducing the recombination velocities at the front emitter and at rear TOPCon structure, a conversion efficiency of 26% may be realized with this cell structure. Additionally, with the help of Sentaurus device model Chen et al. also claimed that 23.2% efficient single sided TOPCon solar cells may be developed on 10 -cm, 3 ms CZ wafers by implementing the selective emitte
