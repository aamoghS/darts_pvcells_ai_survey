he absorbing layer as much as possible from the rear side metallic contact. But as Titanium is a very loose metal, it canâ€™t reflect back the evanescent light in the longer wavelength region. Consequently, the authors used either a stack of lowly doped 200 nm ITO and 1

was thus observed in both the cases. However, the solar
