oxide layers compared to the oxide layers grown by other methods. Finally, n-TOPCon solar cells featuring full area passivated rear contact were developed by applying these differently grown ultra-thin SiO

layers for the formation of TOPCon structure [36]. A power conversion efficiency of 24.8% with a V

of 716 mV was achieved for HNO
