and FF =79.7% based on n-type multicrystalline silicon substrate were developed. Additionally, “efficiency limiting bulk recombination analysis” (ELBA) also revealed an efficiency potential of 22.5% for n-type TOPCon solar cells based on multicrystalline silicon material. Concurrently, in 2017, Benick et al. reported that a conversion efficiency of 22.3% with V
