layer, doped poly-Si layer, front emitter and rear side light management. 6.1.Ultra-thin SiO
x 
layer The quality of ultra-thin SiO
x 
layer may be recognised by its surface passivation quality, thermal stability and carrier tunnelling ability. As a result, different types of studies such as finding out the best possible route to develop high quality tunnelling layer, required properties for o
