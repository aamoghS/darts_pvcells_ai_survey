PCon structure onto the rough surface as the rough surface possesses higher adhesive force and consequently, chances of blister formation get reduced even after thermal annealing process. Secondly, high temper

ature deposition of doped a-Si:H layer may result in low hydrogen content inside the film. For an example, the authors observed almost no blistering of the annealed TOPCon structure when the doped a-Si:H layer
