PCon structure is to use it as rear emitter in p-type c-Si solar cells which is going to be discussed in the following section. 5.TOPCon as rear emitter in p-type Si solar cells The performance of p-type rear junction silicon solar cells with TOPCon rear emitter was investigated both theoretically and experi

layer acts as front surface field (FSF) which improves the collection probability of holes with a greater extent. On the other hand, rear n
