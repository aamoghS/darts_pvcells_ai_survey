ar cells featuring Ag single layer as the rear electrode and metalized area fraction of 3% at the front side. The authors suggested that further improvement in the power conversion efficiency may be realized by reducing the recombination current density at front emitter. Consequently, Hermle et al. realized an enhancement in power conversion efficiency by placing selective emitter structure underneath the front side metallic contact [25]. Here, the best cell fabricated on n-type FZ c-Si wafer wi
