se the rear side metallization of TOPCon solar cell has been realized by various techniques such as thermal evaporation, PVD or electroplating etc. [20,91]. On the other hand, for large scale or mass production purpose the metallization has been mostly accomplished by screen printing and firing process for numerous advantages such as high throughput, low cost, probability of better rear side reflection of the evanescent light, simplicity etc. [43,86,115–117, 118–126].
