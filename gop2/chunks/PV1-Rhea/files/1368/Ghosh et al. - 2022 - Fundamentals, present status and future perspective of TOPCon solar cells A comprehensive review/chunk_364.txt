. In the cell structure, in-situ P-doped poly-Si layer served the purpose of rear side passivating contact. Furthermore, the authors performed a simulation study with the help of Quokka2 simulation tool and the study revealed that the power conversion efficiency may be enhanced up to 26% by improving the wafer quality a
