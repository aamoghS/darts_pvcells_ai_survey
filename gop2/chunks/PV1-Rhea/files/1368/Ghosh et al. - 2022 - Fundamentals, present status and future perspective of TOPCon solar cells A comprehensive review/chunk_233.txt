contacts [90]. The study revealed that lightly doped 100 nm dc magnetron sputtered ITO layer may be sufficient enough to realize significant improvement in the optical reflection for poly-Si/ITO/Ag stack in comparison with poly-Si/Ag stack. However, surface passivation quality of TOPCon structure may be degraded due to ITO sputtering on doped ploy-Si layer. But high thermal stability of TOPCon structure allowed the authors to carry out the thermal treatment of poly-Si/ITO/Ag stack at relatively
