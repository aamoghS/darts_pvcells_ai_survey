g issues associated with this high efficiency TOPCon solar cells is the use of expensive Ag paste for the metallization purpose in the both the sides of the cells. Therefore, minimization of the consumption of Ag paste is absolutely necessary to reduce the cost of the solar cells. In this regard, mass production of more bifacial solar cells may become helpful as in case of bifacial solar cells full area metallic contact is not required. Apart from this, the impact of using alternative metal (lik
