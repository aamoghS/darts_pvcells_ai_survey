nitride (SiN
x
) layer also serves the purpose of anti-reflection coating (ARC) so that optical confinement inside the solar cell can be enlarged. Using this novel structure, apart from high implied voltage (iV
oc
), high implied fill factor (iFF) was also obtained in both maximum power point (MPP) and open-circuit (OC) conditions. In the cell fabrication process, front side metallic contacts were realized by thermally evaporated Ti/Pd/Ag seed layer and subsequent electro
-
plating of Ag layer.
