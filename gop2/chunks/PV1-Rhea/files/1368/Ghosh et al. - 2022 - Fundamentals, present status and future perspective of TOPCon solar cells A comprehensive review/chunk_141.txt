as ∼94 and ∼35% for “pinhole samples” and “tunneling samples”, respectively. According to Galleni et al., the dominant charge carrier transportation mechanism through the ultra-thin SiO
x 
layer was found to be dependent on the annealing temperature along with the formation process of SiO
x 
layer [57]. In the report, the authors revealed that relatively higher annealing temperature (850
◦
C to 950
◦
C) was required to enable the pinhole dominant transportation process of charge
