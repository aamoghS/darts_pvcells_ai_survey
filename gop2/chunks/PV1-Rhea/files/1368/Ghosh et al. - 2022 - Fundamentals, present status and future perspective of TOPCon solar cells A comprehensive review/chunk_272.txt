bination losses at front emitter and Auger recombination losses at crystalline silicon bulk possessed a major contribution in the net electrical power losses. The occurrence of other significant electrical power losses may be attributed to the lateral movement of the charge carriers towards the front contacts and recombination of the charge carriers in the perimeter of the solar cell. However, carrier recombination losses and resistive power losses at the rear side of the cell were found to be l
