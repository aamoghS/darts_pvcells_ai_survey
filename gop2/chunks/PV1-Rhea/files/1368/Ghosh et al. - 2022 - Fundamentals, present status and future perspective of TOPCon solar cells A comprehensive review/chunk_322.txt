y of 24% may be achieved after improving the bulk lifetime and implementing the selective boron emitter and multiwire contacts on the front. 9.Technological options for the mass production of TOPCon solar cells Improvement in the conversion efficiency of the large area, industrial scalable TOPCon solar cells is undoubtedly facilitating its path to turn out to be a very tough competitor to the present state-of-the-art PERC/ PERL/PERT solar cells. Recent report of ITRPV has also revealed that the
