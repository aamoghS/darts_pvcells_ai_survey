ont surface field (FSF) may be attributed to the reasonable increment of the series resistance compared to its counterpart. Gao et al. also studied the feasibility of using TOPCon structure as rear emitter in p-type c-Si solar cells [32]. In the contribution, to conduct the passivation study, symmetrical n-TOPCon structure was fabricated by industrial feasible PECVD system based onto <100>oriented, 1-3 -cm resistive, 170
