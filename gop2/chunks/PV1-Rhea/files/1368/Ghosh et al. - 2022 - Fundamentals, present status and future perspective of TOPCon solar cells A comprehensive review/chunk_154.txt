eters such as fabrication process, doping concentration, thickness of the layer, annealing atmosphere, annealing time, annealing temperature, even post annealing treatments. The following section will deal with different measures taken for improving the quality of doped poly-Si layer. 6.2.1.Development of doped poly-Si layer Ion implanted doped poly-Si layer.Plasma enhanced chem
