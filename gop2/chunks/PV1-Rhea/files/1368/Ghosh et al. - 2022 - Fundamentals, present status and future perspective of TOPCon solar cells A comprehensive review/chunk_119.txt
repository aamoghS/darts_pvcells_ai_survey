ed by using ToF-SIMS (Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy) technique and for spectral ellipsometry process, applied model has an influential role on the data interpretation. Additionally, several high resolution techniques namely TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), ARXPS (Angle Resolved XPS) and ToF-SIMS were used to understand the structural and chemical composition of the interfacial tunneling oxide layer. The effect of annealing on the homogeneity of the interfacial oxide layer
