ed solar cells demonstrated lower contact recombination losses compared to standard p-PERC solar cells. However, enhanced optical losses due to parasitic absorption of light by doped poly-Si layer partially compensated the electrical gains and hence a total efficiency gain of below 1% was realized. Still, the authors pointed out that the power output density of both conventional p-PERC solar cells and TOPCon upgraded p-PERC solar cells may be maximized by three ways: (i) reducing the width of th
