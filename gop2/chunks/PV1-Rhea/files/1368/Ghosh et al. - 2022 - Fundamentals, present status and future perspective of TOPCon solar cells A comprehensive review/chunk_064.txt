ture at the rear side [29]. In this study, atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was used for the deposition of ultra-thin SiO
x 
layer. TEM images revealed an excellent conformal growth of SiO
x 
layer even onto the textured wafers. In addition, no pinhole was observed at Si/SiO
x 
interface and hence the transportation of the charge carriers through the ultrathin SiO
x 
layer would be governed by tunnelling process only. On the other hand, ALD technique also provides the facility of pre
