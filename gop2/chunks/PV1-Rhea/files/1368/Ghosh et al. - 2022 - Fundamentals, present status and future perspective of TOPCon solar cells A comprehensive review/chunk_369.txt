and a pseudo-FF of 77.3 ±1.3%. Finally, the authors claimed that the result was quite satisfactory to use sputter deposited ITO thin film as a recombination layer connecting perovskite top cell and Si bottom cell and a power conversion efficiency of 25% may be obtained for monolithic perovskite/Si tandem solar cells. On the other hand,
