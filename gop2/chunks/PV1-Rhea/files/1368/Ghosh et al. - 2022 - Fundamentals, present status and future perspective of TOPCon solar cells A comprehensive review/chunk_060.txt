on. 4.Both sided TOPCon structure based on n-type c-Si wafers In 2018, Tao et al. reported about the fabrication of both sided TOPCon solar cells featuring p-TOPCon structure at the front side and n- TOPCon structure at the rear side [28]. Besides, the authors also studied the impact of ITO sputtering onto n-TOPCon and p-TOPCon structure which were fabricated symmetrically onto 3â€“8 -cm, n type, double-side polished CZ c-Si wafers. The study revealed that the deposition of ITO layers onto p-TO
