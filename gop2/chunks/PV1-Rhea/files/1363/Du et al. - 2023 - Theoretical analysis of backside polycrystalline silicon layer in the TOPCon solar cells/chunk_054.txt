solar cells. In the case of narrow band system, the quantum well formed at the valence band at the interface of poly-Si leads to the accumulation of holes, which makes the recombination rate surge and leads to poor device performance. When the band gap increases to 1.34 eV, the quantum well disappears, the recombination rate decreases by two orders of magnitude, and the performance improves. Therefore, in order to obtain good TOPCon solar cells, attention should be paid to control the width of t
