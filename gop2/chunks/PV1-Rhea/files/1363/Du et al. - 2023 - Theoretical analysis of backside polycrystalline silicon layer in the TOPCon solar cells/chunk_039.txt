lar cells. It can be seen that the V
oc 
and J
sc 
of the TOPCon solar cells decreases continuously with the increase of the concentration of the acceptor-like defect states. However, FF shows an increasing trend, and E
ff 
of TOPCon solar cells becomes significantly worse with increasing concentration. The defect states concentration of acceptor-like defect states increases from 1E18 to 1.5E20, the V
oc 
of TOPCon solar cells decreases from 729.5 to 692 mV, J
sc 
decreases from 40.68 to 36.02 m
