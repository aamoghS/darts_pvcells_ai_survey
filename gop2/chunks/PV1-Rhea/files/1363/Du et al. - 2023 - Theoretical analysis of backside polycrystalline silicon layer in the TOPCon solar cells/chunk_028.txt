 gap will be decrease when doped with carbon, then the band gap will increase. With the change of band gap, V
oc
, J
sc
, FF and E
ff 
of TOPCon solar cells have been greatly changed. Fig. 2 shows the V
oc
, J
sc
, FF and E
ff 
of TOPCon solar cells with different band gaps. By changing the band gap width from 1.11 eV to 1.34 eV, the V
oc 
of TOPCon solar cells increases from 711.6 to 745.5 mV, J
sc 
increases from 39.17 to 41.34 mA/cm
