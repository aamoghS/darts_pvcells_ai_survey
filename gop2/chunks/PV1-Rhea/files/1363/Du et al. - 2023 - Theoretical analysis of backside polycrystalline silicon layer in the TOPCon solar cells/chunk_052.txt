ositions of the donor-like defect states on the performance of TOPCon solar cells. It is finally found that the effects of donor-like defect states at different locations on the performance of TOPCon solar cells are not significantly different. This is probably because all the donor-like defect states are concentrated in the middle of the band gap, so the defect have a similar effect on the device mechanism. The difference between changing the concentration of defect states in all donor-like def
