-type emitter, its thickness is 30 nm which is related to the optimized selective emitter doping profile. The structure of poly-Si itself leads to many defect in its band gap [19]. In most of the papers [20,21], the defect distribution in poly-Si is modeled similarly. Exponentially distributed band tailed states and Gaussian distributed donor-like defect states and acceptor-like defect states. But the actua
