um efficiency test, we can simply analyze the loss mechanism of the short-circuit current. It can be observed from Fig. 10(a) that the differences in EQE and reflectivity brought about by different back surface topography are more reflected in the 900â€“1100 nm long- wavelength light [1,38]. This is because long-wavelength light needs
