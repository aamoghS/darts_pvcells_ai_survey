 further promote the improvement of solar cell efficiency. The above studies show that three different chemical etching methods can produce significant differences in post-diffusion edge isolation. Flatter surface topography, fewer surface defects, and dangling bonds can greatly improve the open-circuit voltage of solar cells. At the same time, it can also improve the reflection of long- wavelength light on the back surface to improve the absorption and reduce its entry into the heavily doped po
