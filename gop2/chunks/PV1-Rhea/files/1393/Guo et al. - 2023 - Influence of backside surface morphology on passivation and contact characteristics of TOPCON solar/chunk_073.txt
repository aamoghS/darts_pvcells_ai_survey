nsport and thus reduces contact resistivity. With the increase of acid polishing weight loss, the tip of the pyramid is gradually rounded, the uncovered area of the glass layer is gradually reduced, the existence of this transmission mode is reduced, and the contact resistivity is gradually increased. While alkali polishing directly flattens the tip of the pyramid, direct transmission is almost non-existent. In addition, thicker silicon nitride films deposited by PECVD due to planarized surfaces
