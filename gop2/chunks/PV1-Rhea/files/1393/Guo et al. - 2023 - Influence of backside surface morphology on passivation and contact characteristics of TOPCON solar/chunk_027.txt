PCON solar cell. Due to the thin thickness of the tunnel oxide layer and the existence of pinholes in the oxide layer, there may be localized metal burn-through. At the same time, the doping tailing of P atoms in the substrate is also inevitable, so the transport path of the current includes the transport through the polysilicon and the substrate. The second structure is shown in Fig. 3(b), the polysilicon region is separated by a thick oxide layer insulating region (>100 nm), and the current on
