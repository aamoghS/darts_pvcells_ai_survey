ciency (24.05%) is the highest. This indicates that for the currently used silver paste, the acid-polished surface can better balance the contradiction between the metal contact and surface passivation, and obtain higher conversion efficiency. But for the alkali-polished samples, the significant deterioration of the metal contact causes serious losses, which are difficult to make up for the increase in open voltage and short-circuit current brought about by the flat surface. It is difficult to o
