ysilicon and metal in the three morphological samples have formed similar and good ohmic contacts. Minor differences may come from the metal-covered surface area, and actual firing temperature [18,44]. After the polishing weight loss is relatively large, the change of the surface area also slows down, which may also be the reason why
