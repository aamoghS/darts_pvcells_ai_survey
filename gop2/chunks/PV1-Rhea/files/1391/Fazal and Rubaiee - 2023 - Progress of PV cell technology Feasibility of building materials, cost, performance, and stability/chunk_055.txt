loss, fill factor loss, optical loss, and insufficient energy photon loss [75]. 2.3.Generation III: Emerging solar cells Third-generation PV technologies, including dye-sensitized, organic, and perovskite cells, are still under intensive research and development [76] in laboratories. Fig. 5 shows the schematic of dye-sensitized, organic, and perovskite cells. The concept of DSSC resembles natural photosynthesis [29]. The main components of DSSC as shown in Fig. 5 (a) include photoanodes (e.g., m
