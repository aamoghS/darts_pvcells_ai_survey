 also limited its commercial applications. Researchers around the globe are putting tremendous effort in overcoming these problems. The addition of nanotextured interfaces [100], potassium passivation [99] with top cell, carbazole (nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecule) [101], and a small amount of sodium fluoride (NaF) [102] in perovskite as stabilizer has been reported to reduce the optical loses and thus, improve TSC efficiency. Recently, a two-terminal TSC with wide bandgap perovskite (M
