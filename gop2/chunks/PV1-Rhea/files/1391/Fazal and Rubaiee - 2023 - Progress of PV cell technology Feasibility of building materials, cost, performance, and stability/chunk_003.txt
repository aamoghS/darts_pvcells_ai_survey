ain the best price competitiveness among all other potential PV technologies for the next decades. The traditional Al-BSF is gradually replaced by PERC and going to be outdated by 2026. The other c-Si based PV technologies including SHJ, TOPCon and IBC are expected to be mainstream in the latest 2/3 years due to their improved efficiency and reduced cost. However, the maximum c-Si based PV efficiency (26.1%) is approaching its theoretical Auger efficiency limit of 29.43% and therefore, some inno
