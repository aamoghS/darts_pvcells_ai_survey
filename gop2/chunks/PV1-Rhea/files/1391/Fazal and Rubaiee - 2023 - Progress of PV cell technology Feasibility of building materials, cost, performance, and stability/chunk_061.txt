can be improved. This emerging technology aims to make solar PV systems more efficient and less expensive by using various new materials, such as [84]. However, remarkable progress is observed in this third-generation PV technology; as such, it is expected to arrive and capture the market soon [17]. 2.4.Generation IV: Tandem PV technology A vast majority of PV cells available in the market have an efficiency limit of 20â€“25%. In fact, the efficiency achieved by a single junction c-Si approaches
