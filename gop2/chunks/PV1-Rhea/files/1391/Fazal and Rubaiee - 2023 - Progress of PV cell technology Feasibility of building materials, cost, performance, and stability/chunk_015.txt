gy till 2018. In recent times, various high-efficiency silicon based crystalline cells such as passivated emitter rear cell (PERC), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), interdigitated back contact (IBC), tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells are gaining more interest [24]. However, silicon-based PV has some drawbacks, including energy-intensive high-temperature processing, fragility [25], and limited module efficiency [26]. In addition, the re
