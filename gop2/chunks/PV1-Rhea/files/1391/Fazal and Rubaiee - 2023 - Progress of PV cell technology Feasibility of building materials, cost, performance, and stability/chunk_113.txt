junction TSC technology faces some difficulties including unsatisfactory performance, ease of fabrication, cost minimization, compatibility, instability and short service life or toxicity of the constituent subcells. The key issues to be explored in the development of super-high- efficiency MJ solar cells include the selection of subcell materi
