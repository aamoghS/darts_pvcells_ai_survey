 usage. However, CIGS is expected to be commercially outdated in 2035, whereas c-Si and CdTe are expected to maintain the best competitiveness among other technologies in the future. The practical efficiency of c-Si approaches its theoretical limit; thus, some innovative strategies, such as III-Vs, IIIâ€“V/Si and PVK/Si, might lead the technological progress in the near future.  vi) The most common faults in cells/modules are electrical (poor soldering, shunts, short-circuited cells, broken inte
