 years [128,132]. However, service life and energy-yielding performance are also influenced by operating conditions, locations, and environments. Santhakumari and Sagar, [133] comprehensively reviewed various atmospheric parameters responsible for deteriorating the module/cell efficiency, and failure categories that occur in a PV module over time during operation. All sorts of PV cells/modules can be subjected to different environmental factors, including dust, temperature, wind velocity, humidi
