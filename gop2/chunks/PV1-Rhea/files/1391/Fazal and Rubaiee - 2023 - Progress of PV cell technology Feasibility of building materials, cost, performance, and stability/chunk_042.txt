hallenges currently faced by SHJ are metallization [59], silver and indium free processing [56], quality of Si thin film, ultraviolet (UV) light stability [60], manufacturing process complexity [61] and so on. Fig. 3 presents the projected world market share for different silicon- based PV technologies [58]. In the near future, multijunction silicon or silicon tandem, IBC cells are expected to be potentially increased. Their future progresses could also be much more rapid than originally antic
