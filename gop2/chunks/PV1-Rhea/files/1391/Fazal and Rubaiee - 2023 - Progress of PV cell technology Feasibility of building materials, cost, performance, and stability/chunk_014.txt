rrent achievements should be systematically explored, and potential research directions for future applications should be presented. The commercially available Si-based PV modules are mostly either single- (sc-Si) or multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si). To date, silicon is the most widely used semiconductor material employed in manufacturing PV modules. Crystalline silicon-based aluminum back surface field (Al- BSF) was the most popular PV technology till 2018. In recent times, various high-effici
