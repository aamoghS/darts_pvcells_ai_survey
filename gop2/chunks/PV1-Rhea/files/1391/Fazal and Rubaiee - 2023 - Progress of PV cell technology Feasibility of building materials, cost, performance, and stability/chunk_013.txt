reported in literatures. It appears that several research points must be discussed systematically to understand the feasibility of existing PV technologies. However, the scattered literature studies hardly allow to understand how competing technologies affect conversion efficiency, operating stability, cost, and performance to meet the future needs. Most often common people are unaware of the feasibility of existing PV technologies. Therefore, current achievements should be systematically explor
