t PV technologies. In most cases, c-Si PV is reported as the most feasible technology. Currently, 90% of the PV market is dominated by c-Si, and 10% of the market is represented by thin-film PV modules and a low extent with different categories. The PV technologies currently available in mass production include c-Si, CdTe, and CIGS while lab or pilot scales include III-Vs and perovskites.
