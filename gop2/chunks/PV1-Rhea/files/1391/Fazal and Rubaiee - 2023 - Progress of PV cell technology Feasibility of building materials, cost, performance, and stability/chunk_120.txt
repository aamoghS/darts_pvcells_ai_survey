erovskite can be attributed to humidity, phase instability, thermal instability, and ion migration. They added that the possible solution could be additive engineering, surface passivation engineering, and perovskite composition engineering. The efficiency degradation rates of PERC, SHJ, CdTe, CIGS, and IIIâ€“V (Fig. 12, inset) were 0.5, 0.7, 0.45, 0.45 and 0.4%/year respectively in 2020 and are expected to be reduced to 0.4%/year or below by 2030. The mean power degradation rates of sc-Si, mc-S
