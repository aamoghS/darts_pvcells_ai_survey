ed alarming attentions because of its low cost and remarkable progress in achieving efficiency in a short span of time. For easier fabrication and reduced cost, two terminals (2 T, also known as monolithic) perovskite/Si TSC as shown in Fig. 6(a) is preferred. In 2 T perovskite/Si TSC, the perovskite top cell is fabricated directly on the top of the Si bottom cell where current matching is essential. While in three- or four-terminal (3 T or 4 T) configuration (Fig. 6b and c), the perovskite top
