 operating module temperature increases, the maximum power (P

) and open circuit voltage (V
oc
) decrease, whereas the short circuit current (I

) slightly increases. The PV efficiency decreases as the module surface tempera

ture increases mainly because of the decrease in V

[126,148]. Thin film c-Si and c-Si cells are more sensitive to temperature than other cell technologies. The percentage of efficiency loss due to an increase in module surface temperature is usually determined by
