rials instead of indirect band gap silicon. However, the commercial use of second-generation PV technology is still limited because of some unresolved issues and challenges regarding reasonable efficiency levels on a competitive price. The common thin-film PV technologies currently available are a-Si, CdTe, and CIGS, w
