nner wafers, reduces Ag paste use (drop to 50 mg/cell), increases throughputs, and enhances the module efficiency to 23%. PV modules with other materials have been developed in recent years because of remarkable research progress globally on this aspect. Therefore, these PV technologies are considered promising technology in recent and near-future time. In addition to these technologies, the IIIâ€“V and perovskite PVs are currently in small- scale or pilot production [8]. As per Fig. 9(b), the e
