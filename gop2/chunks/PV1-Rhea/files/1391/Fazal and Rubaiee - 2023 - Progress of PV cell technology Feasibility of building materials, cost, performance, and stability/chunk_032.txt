re produced from pseudo-square silicon wafer substrates, cut from column ingots grown via a Czochralski (Cz) technique. This technique is used to produce sc-Si from mc-Si. The entire technology in producing sc-Si is expensive. The maximum sc-Si cell efficiency reported by NREL is 26.1% [39]. However, mc-Si cells are made of square silicon substrates cut from polycrystalline ingots grown in quartz crucibles. They are less expensive than single-crystalline silicon cells. The maximum mc-Si cell eff
