9] investigated the degradation behavior of a-Si, mc-Si and HIT modules upon outdoor exposure for 28 months in India. They observed that the average peak power was reduced by 6.4%, 0.5% and 0.36% for a-Si, mc-Si and HIT modules respectively. Oxidation of antireflecting coating, soiling of glass, and wavy pattern at the back of PV module was the frequent defects reported by them. However, no visual defects were identified in the HIT module except soling of glass. The efficiency degradation rate (
