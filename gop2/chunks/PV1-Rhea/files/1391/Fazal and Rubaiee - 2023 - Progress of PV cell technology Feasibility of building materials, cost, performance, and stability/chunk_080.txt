5, 44.4, and 47.6% accordingly. Researchers across the globe are still optimistic about the improved performance and commercialization of new- generation PV cells. To predict the technological move in the future and the required materials and cost, Gervais et al., [7] conducted an in- depth study considering two pathways, namely, scenario A (Moderate roadmap) and scenario B (Innovative roadmap). Scenario A depicts the conservative evolution of PV technologies and their exitance in the coming dec
