nology with strong advantages, including abundant supply, matured structure, rapidly decreasing material cost, and good semiconductor quality [52]. PV industries are shifting from aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) c-Si to passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) to increase efficiency further [32].
