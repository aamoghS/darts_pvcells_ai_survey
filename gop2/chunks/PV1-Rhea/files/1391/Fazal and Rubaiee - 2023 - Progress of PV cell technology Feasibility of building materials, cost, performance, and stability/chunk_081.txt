tions and the fall of noncompetitive PV cell technologies. Besides, Fig. 8 illustrates the development of PV market until 2050, considering the moderate roadmap with scenario A and the innovative roadmap with scenario B [7]. In both scenarios, market share for PERC decreases with time, while it increases for IIIâ€“V/Si technology. Scenario B presents its favorable
