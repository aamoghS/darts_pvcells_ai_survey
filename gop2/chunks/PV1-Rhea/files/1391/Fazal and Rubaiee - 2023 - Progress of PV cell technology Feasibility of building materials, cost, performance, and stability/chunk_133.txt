 film quality - Toxic in nature, less stability - Performance is degraded over time Tandem PV  III-V/Si and PVK/ Si tandem cells - Highly increased efficiency - Materials compatibility, wider bandgap - Control of manufacturing cost - Minimization of thermalization loses - Major challenges with structure, material processing, junction multiplications, stability, carrier confinement, LETID, lattice matching etc.
