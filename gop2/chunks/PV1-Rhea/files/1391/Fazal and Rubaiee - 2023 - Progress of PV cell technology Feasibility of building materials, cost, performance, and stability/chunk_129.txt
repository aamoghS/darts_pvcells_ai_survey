- Reduced surface recombination - Less reflection due to having SiN
x 
- Cell efficiency is approaching to limit - Cost reduction is slowed - Light induced degradation Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) - Has high efficiency - Low temperature coefficient - Bifacial harvesting at lower cost - Major challenge â€“ Ag and In free SHJ - Metallization and poor thin film - UV light stability & process complexity Thin film PV Amorphous silicon  - Light, cheap and less silicon is needed. - It can be wrapped ar
