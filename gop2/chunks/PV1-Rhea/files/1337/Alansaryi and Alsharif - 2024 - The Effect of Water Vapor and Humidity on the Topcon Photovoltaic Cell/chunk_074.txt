ing to the relatively low reliability of Topcon modules, particularly at high temperatures and humidity. 
However, recent developm
ents have produced a strong substitute for conventional one
-
step cofiring: laser
-
assisted 
firing techniques such as laser
-
enhanced contact optimization (LECO), which combine a laser treatment after 
conventional cofiring at relatively low temperatures. The 
main goal of laser
-
assisted firing is to enable higher 
power conversion efficiencies (PCE) [4].
