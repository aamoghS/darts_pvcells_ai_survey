e. The effect of haze on the amount of 
irradiance is explained by the exponential

linear 
model. Additionally, the quantitative loss of PV power due to haze is the main focus of the PV system model. It 
is possible to determine the losses resulting from haze on PV power generation in 2017 and 201
8 by modeling 
and analyzing data samples of PV power generation in Hangzhou, China. In 2017 the losses were 5.25 ± 1.19 % 
and 6 ± 1.16 % of the original PV power generation, respectively. In addi
