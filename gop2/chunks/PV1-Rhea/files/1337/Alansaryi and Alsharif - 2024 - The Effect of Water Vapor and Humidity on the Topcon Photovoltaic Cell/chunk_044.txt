rmance losses in bifacial 
PV modules, researchers at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) have carried out 
a number of damp heat tests. Three encapsulant materials 
used in PV module production were compared by the 
scientists in their study "Corrosion effects in bifacial crystalline silicon PV modules; interactions between 
metallization and encapsulation," which was published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
 
These materials 
are ethylene vinyl acetat
