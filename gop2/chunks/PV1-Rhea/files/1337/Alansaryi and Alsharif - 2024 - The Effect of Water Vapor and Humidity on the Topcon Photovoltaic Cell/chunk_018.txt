on of the solar energy that actually reaches the solar cell. In addition to the 30%, there have 
been estimated losses of 15

30% of the energy. One of the effects of humidity
 
was observed to be a decrease in 
the percentage of solar energy utilized, from approximately 70% to between 55 and 60% [3]

Background 
 
The global photovoltaic (PV) market has been significantly impacted by tunneling oxide 
passivated contact 
(Topcon) solar cells. However, the module bill of materials that can
