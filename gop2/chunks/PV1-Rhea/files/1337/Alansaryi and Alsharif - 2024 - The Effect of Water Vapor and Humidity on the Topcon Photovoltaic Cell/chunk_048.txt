For crystalline silicon (c

Si) solar cells, metallization has always been and continues to be a crucial area of 
development, along with wet processing, junction formation, and passivation. Because of the close relationship 
between the race to reach the 25%
 
cell efficiency milestone (Figure 3), and the development of metallization 
approaches during the early 1940s and 2000s. F
