t testing at 85 Â°C and 85% relative humidity 
(DH85), the Joly wood Special Injected Metallization (JSIM) solar cells outperform the standard Topcon cells by 
a significant margin. Several i
nvestigations have brought attention to possible reliability problems that Topcon 
solar cells and modules may encounter when operating, especially in situations with high temperatures and 
humidity [5, 6, 8, 9]. Significant reductions in power output have b
