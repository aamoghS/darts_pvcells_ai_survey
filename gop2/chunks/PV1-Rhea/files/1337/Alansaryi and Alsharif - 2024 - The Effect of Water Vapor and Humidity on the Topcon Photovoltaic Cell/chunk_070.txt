pcon photovoltaic cell due to its exposure to weather and 
environmental conditions and u
nstable weather, especially in high humidity conditions. The bulk of previous 
studies indicate that the haze, rains, moisture and high humidity, in addition to bad weather conditions, have bad 
effects on the performance of photovoltaic cells and the quanti
ty of electric power generated [24, 25, 26].
 
 
Many attempts have been tried to protect photovoltaic cells from adverse effects of environmental cond
