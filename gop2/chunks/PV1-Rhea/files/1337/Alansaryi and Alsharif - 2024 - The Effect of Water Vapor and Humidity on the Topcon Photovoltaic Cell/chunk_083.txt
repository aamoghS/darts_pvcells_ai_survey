comes the 
primary factor affecting solar
 
irradiance and significantly lowers PV power generation. In order to examine the 
weight factors of the effects of haze on irradiance, this study suggests using the enhanced method of the degree 
of grey slope incidence. The effect of haze on the amount of 
irradiance is explained by the exponential
-
linear 
model [25].
