d that poor weathering and high humidity have a negative 
impact on photovoltaic cells' and panels' performance. For instance, haze has a major impact
 
on photovoltaic (PV) 
power generation. Quantitative studies on the impact of haze on photovoltaic power generation are scarce; 
however, as fine particulate matter concentrations increase, they become the main factor influencing solar 
irradiance and drasti
