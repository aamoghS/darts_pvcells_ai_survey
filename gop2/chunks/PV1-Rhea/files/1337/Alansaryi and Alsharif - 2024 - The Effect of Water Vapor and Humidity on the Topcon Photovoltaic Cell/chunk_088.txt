cal implications for this study. The theoretical 
implications include explaining the importance of conducting experimental studies that address the problem of 
the negative impact of humidity, water va
por, and unstable weather on the performance of electrical power 
generation units from sunlight. This also includes focusing on appropriate means to protect these units and 
maintain the highest possible performance by reducing the risks exposed to them. Th
e practical implications 
include the
