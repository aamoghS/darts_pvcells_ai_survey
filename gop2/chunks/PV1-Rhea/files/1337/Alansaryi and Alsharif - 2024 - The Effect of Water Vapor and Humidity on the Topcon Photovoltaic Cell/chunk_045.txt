These materials 
are ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyolefin elastomers (POE), and thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO). According 
to the research team, POE and TPO, in contrast to EVA, do not release any acidic components; therefore, they 
may be more effectiv
e against acid

induced corrosion than EVA. This observation was made in earlier studies. It 
takes a while before significant field degradation can be seen, so there is currently no concrete proof that using 
these materials will i
