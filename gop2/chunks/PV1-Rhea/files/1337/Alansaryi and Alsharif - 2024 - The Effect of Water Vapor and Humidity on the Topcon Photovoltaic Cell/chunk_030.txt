oxide, was seen in the growth interface between the silicon substrate and 
silicon oxide layer during the growth of the oxide layer at a depth of roughly 0.75 nm. Transition region properties 
mainly influenced the properties of the tunnel o
xide layer, which was less than 2 nm thick. Tunnel oxide layer 
passivation characteristics ought to be contingent upon the p
