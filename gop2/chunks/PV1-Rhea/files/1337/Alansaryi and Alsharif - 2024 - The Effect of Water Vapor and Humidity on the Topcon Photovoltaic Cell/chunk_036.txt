n junction at the front. A thorough examination 
of the power loss reveals that these cells balance the usual transport losses, recombination losses, and
 
transport 
losses of electrons and holes. Systematic simulation studies have shown the potential and superiority of these rear 
junction solar cells by establishing some fundamental design guidelines with efficiencies exceeding 26% for future 
silicon solar 
cells [16].
