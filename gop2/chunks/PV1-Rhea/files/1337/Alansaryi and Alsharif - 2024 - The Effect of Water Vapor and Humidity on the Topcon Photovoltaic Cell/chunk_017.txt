% of the total energy coming from the sun is absorbed or reflected back by landmasses, clouds, 
and oceans. Higher humidity cities, such as Los Angeles and Hamburg, where average humidity ranges from 40 
to 78%, produce a thin layer of water vapor at the fro

absorption and reflection of the solar energy that actually reaches the s
