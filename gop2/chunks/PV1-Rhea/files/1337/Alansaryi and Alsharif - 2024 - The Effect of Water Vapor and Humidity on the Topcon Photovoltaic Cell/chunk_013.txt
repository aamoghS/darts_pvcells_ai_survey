as received increased attention for the 
development of high performance solar cells. The b
ond between SiO in the tunnel oxide layer, which is impacted 
by the subsequent annealing, is clearly responsible for the quality of passivation of the tunnel oxide layer. The 
tunnel oxide layer was formed in the suboxide region (SiO, Si

) at the interface with the substrate. 
Subsequent annealing results in the formation of an oxygen

rich bond in the suboxide region, which enhances
