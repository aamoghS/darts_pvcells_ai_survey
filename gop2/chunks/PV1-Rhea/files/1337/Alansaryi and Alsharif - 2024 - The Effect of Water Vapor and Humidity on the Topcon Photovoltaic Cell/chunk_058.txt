an haze can cause low irradiance conditions and 
soiling. This review looks at how ha
ze affects PV performance, highlighting important findings and pointing out 
apparent gaps in the literature. Apart from the serious health risks posed by dust storm particles, bushfire smoke, 
and industrial exhaust fumes, the primary effect of these haze s
ources is a reduction in sunlight, which can reach 
up to 80% in certain situations. PV operators experience significant annual revenue losses due to pollu
