and other environmental disturbances reduce the yield of PV systems. The transboundary haze episode that 
hit Kuala Lumpur in September and October 2015 resulted in a 17.8% drop in the power produced by photovoltaic 
systems [24].
 
The generation of photovoltaic (PV) power is significantly affected by haze. There aren't many quantitative studies 
on how haze affects PV power generation, but when fine particulate matter concentrations rise, it becomes the 
primary factor affecting solar
