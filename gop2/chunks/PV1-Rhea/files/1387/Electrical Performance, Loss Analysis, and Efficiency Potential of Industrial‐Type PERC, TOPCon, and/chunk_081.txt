h is related to the parasitic ab-sorption of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer. The others are ARC reflectance loss and NIR parasitic absorption loss, which can be benefit from low optical reflectance and the low para-sitic absorption of SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer compared to a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer. Although the front surface escape loss of TOPCon solar cell is worse than SHJ cell, it is indicated that the surface passivation of the boron doping layer is inferior to that of a- Si:H/nc-
