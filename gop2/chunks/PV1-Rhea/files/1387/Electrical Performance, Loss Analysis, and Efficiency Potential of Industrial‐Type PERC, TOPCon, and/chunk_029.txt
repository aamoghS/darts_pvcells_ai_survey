4, LONGi has set a new re-cord for PCE for silicon heterojunction back- contact (HBC) cells, 27.3% [64]. In recent years, with the development of technologies such as nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc- SiOx:H) films [65Â–67], multi- busbar [43], phosphorus (P) gettering [68], and wavelength conversion film [69], more industry participants joined the mar-ket of SHJ solar cell. As predicted by the ITRPV [3], SHJ solar cells are expected to gain a 2023 market share of about 9% to over 25% in the ne
