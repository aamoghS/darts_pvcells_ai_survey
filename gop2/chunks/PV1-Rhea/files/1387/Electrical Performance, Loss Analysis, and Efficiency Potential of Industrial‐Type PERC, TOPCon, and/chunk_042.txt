d solution. The front boron (B) SE (R,p++ = 75 Ω/sq, R,p+ = 230 Ω/sq) were formed in a quartz tube furnace containing BCl3 gas (Sevenstar) and laser doping technology with the width of 90100 µm (DR laser). After B diffusion, the rear side was also polished by a mixed solution of KOH and polished additives. The rear side stack,
