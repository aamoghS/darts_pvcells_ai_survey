H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) hole- selective layer and an a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) electron- selective layer. The corre-sponding combined selectivity is S10,e&h,max = 15.67 and the lim-iting efficiency to 29.14%. However, the SHJ solar cell features an a- Si:H(i)/a- SiH(p) hole- selective layer and an a- Si:H(i)/a- SiH(n) electron- selective layer, which have a high ρc value of 0.4 and 0.1 Ω·cm2, respectively [31]. This points to the reason why the a- Si:H(i)/a- Si:H contacts offer a lower S10,e&h,max val
