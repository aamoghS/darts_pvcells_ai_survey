allization was achieved by screen printing and firing of a metal paste using an H- patterned grid design on both sides of the wafers (735 ± 5°C).The fabrication sequence of SHJ cell also is shown in Table1. The n- type monocrystalline silicon wafers with a resistivity of 13 Ω·cm were begun with an ozone cleaning process. The wafer gettering process was applied to improve its lifetime. Subsequently, the wafers were textured and cleaned by RCA solution. The intrinsic a- Si:H layers were de
