 P diffusion, the rear side was polished by a mixed solution of KOH and polished additives. Subsequently, the front and rear passiva-tion of the cells were achieved by thermal oxidation tube of SiOx layer with thickness of 12 nm and PECVD of 80- nm- thick SiNx dielectric stacks on the front side and ALD AlOx 35 nm and PECVD 80- nm- thick SiNx dielectric stacks on the rear side and then by laser ablation on the rear side with width of 2035 µm (DR laser). The metallization was achieved by s
