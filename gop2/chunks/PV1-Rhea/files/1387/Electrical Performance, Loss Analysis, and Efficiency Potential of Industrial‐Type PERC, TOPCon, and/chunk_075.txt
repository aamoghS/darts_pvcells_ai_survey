 of boron- doped silicon, the textured surface is controlled ac-cording to the low optical reflectance of small textured sur-face. The primary difference of an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for PERC and SHJ/TOPCon solar cells occurred in the long- wavelength region of 600Â–1000 nm, which is mainly at-tributed to the bulk lifetime between p- type and n- type sili-con wafers. The IQE for SHJ cell exhibited a poor response at TABLE     |    Detailed calculation of Voc and FF using an ideal one
