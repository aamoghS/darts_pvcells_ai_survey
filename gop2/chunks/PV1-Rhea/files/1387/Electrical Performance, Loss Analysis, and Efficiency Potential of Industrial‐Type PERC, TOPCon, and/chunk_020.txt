ch as due to changes in barrier height or effective tunneling mass). For ex-ample, it has been proven that ultrathin SiO2 layers have a larger hole tunneling barrier compared to electrons [38]. TOPCon solar cells have become one of the prospective technologies in the PV market [39]. At present, TOPCon solar cell is one of the main-stream products with a median efficiency of 25%Â–26% [40]. This is due to advancements in surface passivation materials, struc-tures, and technology, including the use
