ctively, than P doping layers. The J0 values of the SiOx/n+- poly- Si layers with the thickness of 100 nm and the SiOx/n+- poly- Si layers with the thickness of 300 nm were about 4 and 6 fA/cm2, respectively, which is higher than that of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H layer has the best passivation performance.The metallization- induced recombination J0, etal for different layers is shown in Figure3B. The J0,metal values of the P- do
