 has grown exponentially, and the market share of PERC p- type mono- Si was 80% in 2022 accord-ing to the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) [3]. The efficiency of p- type monocrystalline PERC cells has been increasing at an absolute efficiency of 0.5% per year [4] and has reached 23%23.5% in large- scale production [5, 6]. The rapid increase in cell efficiency cannot be attributed to improvements
