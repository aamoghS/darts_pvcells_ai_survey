RCA solution. The intrinsic a- Si:H layers were deposited on both sides of wafers using a commercial PECVD system (13.56 MHz) at a low temperature. Then, the n- doped and p- doped nanocrystal-line layers were deposited on the front and rear surfaces of the silicon substrate via a high- frequency PECVD system. Both the front and rear sides were deposited by indium tin oxide (ITO) films with the thicknesses of 100 and 120 nm, respectively. The metallization was achieved by screen printing and firi
