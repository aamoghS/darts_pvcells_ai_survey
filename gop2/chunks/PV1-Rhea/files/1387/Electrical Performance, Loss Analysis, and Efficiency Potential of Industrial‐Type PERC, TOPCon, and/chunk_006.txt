b,e,h,m,max of 28.12% and 27.99%, respectively. Exploiting a perfect passivation of the noncontact area, the wide process window and low cost are required and transferring these new concepts to industrial solar cell production will be the next major challenge.1   |   IntroductionThe solar industry has been attracting attention as a future energy source. Crystalline silicon (c- Si) has the unique features, such as nontoxicity, abundant source, and long- term stability, which has made it a market-
