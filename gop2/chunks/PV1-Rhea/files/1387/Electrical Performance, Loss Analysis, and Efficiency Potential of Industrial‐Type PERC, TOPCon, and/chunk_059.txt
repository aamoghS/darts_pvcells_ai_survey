er and the rear side of SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer, and SHJ structure with the front side of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer and the rear side of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer were simulated (Voc, FF) using Griddler 2.5, and the total saturation current density in the cell (Jo,total), the Jo on the front non- metallized area (J0,front), and the rear non- metallized area (J0,rear) were calculated using the mea-sured values of Jo and Jo,metal according to Equations(1)Â–(3), respectively. The saturation
