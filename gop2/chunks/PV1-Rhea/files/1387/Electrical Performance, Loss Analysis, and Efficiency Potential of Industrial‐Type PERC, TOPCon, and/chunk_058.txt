SiOx:H(p+) layer has the lowest ρc of 0.3 mΩ·cm2, which is attributed to ITO with high carrier concentration. However, p+ layers, such as Al- BSF and SiOx/p+- poly- Si layer, have a high ρc value of about 3 mΩ·cm2, owing to low doping concentration of these layers.3.3   |   SimulationThe PERC structure with the front side of selective P emitter and the rear side of AlOx/SiNx layer, TOPCon structure with the front side of selective B emitter and the rear side of SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer, a
