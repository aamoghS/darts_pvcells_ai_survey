n industrial- type process; further investigated their passivation performance, optical performance, and the IÂ–V parameters of solar cells, that is, efficiency (Eff), open- circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and short- circuit current density (Jsc); and finally discussed its current status and future trends.2   |   Experimental2.1   |   Solar Cell FabricationWe fabricated three types of samples.
