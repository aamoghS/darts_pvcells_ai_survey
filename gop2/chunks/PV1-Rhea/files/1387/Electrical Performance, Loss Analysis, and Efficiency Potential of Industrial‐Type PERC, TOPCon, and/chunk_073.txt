Con and a decrease of 56 fA/cm2 in J01 compared with PERC. And there is a high pFF of 87.7%, indicating that low- temperature screen printing process cannot achieve good conductivity, which will be one of the challenging and critical tasks in SHJ cell. The PERC solar cell also has a high improve-ment in pFF increasing by 2%, indicating that there is a high damage on the passivation layer in high- temperature screen printing process.3.5   |   Failure AnalysisA current loss was used to be discusse
