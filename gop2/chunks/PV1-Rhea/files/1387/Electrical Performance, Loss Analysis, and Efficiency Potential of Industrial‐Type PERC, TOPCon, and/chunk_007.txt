 long- term stability, which has made it a market- dominant technology with an almost 95% mar-ket share [1]. The passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells are derived from the conventional aluminum back surface field (Al- BSF) structure, which was developed by Green etal. at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1989 [2]. However, this technology took 30 years to achieve large- scale production. The production capacity of PERC cells has grown exponentially, and the market share of
