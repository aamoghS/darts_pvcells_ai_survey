lity of PERC solar cells. In addition, improvements in surface passivation ma-terials and techniques, such as the use of thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2)/silicon nitride (SiNx:H) stacked layers on the front surface [1215] and AlOx/SiNx layers on the back surface [1618], have reduced carrier recombination on the surface. The introduc-tion of selective emitter (SE) structures can effectively separate the requirement to form high- quality ohmic contacts from the design of diffuse emitters
