ure AnalysisA current loss was used to be discussed in order to understand the effects of the three types of solar cells. The simulated op-tical reflectance was in agreement with the results of the ex-perimental reflection without any adjustments (Figure7A). In order to maintain the passivation performance of the surface, the SHJ solar cell has a large textured structure with high op-tical reflectance. However, considering the high corrosiveness of boron- doped silicon, the textured surface is
