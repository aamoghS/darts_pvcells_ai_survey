Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, 2024The current loss analysis was carried out using the Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 software (based on the Yablonovitch limit of 46.43 mA/cm2) as shown in Figure7B. Here, there are three primary advantages of TOPCon from SHJ solar cell: The one is blue loss, in which the Jsc is in-creased by 0.65 mA/cm2, which is related to the parasitic ab-sorption of a- Si
