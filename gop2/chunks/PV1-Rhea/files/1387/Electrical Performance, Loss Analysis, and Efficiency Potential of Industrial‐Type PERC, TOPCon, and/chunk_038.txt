terns on one side [70] of the (II), (IV), and (IX) with laser ablation sample on 0.52.1 Ω·cm n/p- type Cz- Si wafers and (V), (VI), (VII), and (VII) sample on 0.52.1 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wafers.Then, we manufactured the three types of solar cells from commercially available 182 × 182 mm CzSi wafers with thick-ness of 140 ± 10 µm. Figure2 shows the schematic depiction of the three types of structural cells. The fabrication sequence of PERC cell is shown in Table1. p- Type Cz- dope
