rfectly passivated (i.e., J0 = 0) on the hole- selective contacts and electron- selective contacts. S10 values were calculated using the measured values of Jo and ρc, listed in Tables5 and 6 according to Schmidt etal. [31]. The resulting selectivities S10,e and S10,h, the efficiency- maximizing contacting area frac-tion fe,max and fh,max, and the maximum efficiency ηe,max and ηh,max are calculated using Equations(4)/(5), (6)/(7), and (8). Among them, the ηmax(S10) is assuming a 2 Ω·cm
