tute of Singapore) [72].3   |   Results3.1   |   The Emitter Dark Saturation Current DensityTo better investigate the effect of passivation, the J0 values of dif-ferent passivated contact layers were tested and characterized as shown in Figure3. Both a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) and a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layers with the thicknesses of a- Si:H 46 nm and nc- SiOx:H 510 nm have the lowest J0 values of about 2 fA/cm2, shown in Figure3A. It can explain why SHJ cell has a high Voc, whereas the P- dop
