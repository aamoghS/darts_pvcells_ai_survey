Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, 2024conductivity, and then the corrosion of the paste on the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+/p+) layers can be ignored. Therefore, the J0,metal value is zero, which is consistent with the highest Voc of SHJ solar cell. Meantime, the SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer also can pro-vide a good conductivity, and then the in
