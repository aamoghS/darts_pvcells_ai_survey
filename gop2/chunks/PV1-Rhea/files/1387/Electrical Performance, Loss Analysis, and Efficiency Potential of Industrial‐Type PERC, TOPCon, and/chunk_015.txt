eached 24.5% of the PERC theoretical performance efficiency calculated by Schmidt etal. [31], and the PERC structure had reached the technical bottleneck. The passivated emitter with rear locally diffused (PERL) solar cell, as an upgraded structure of the PERC solar cell, diffuses over the back metallized contact area to form a local p+ structure. In 2009, the UNSW published PERL's high-est efficiency record of 25.0% [32]. However, the average effi-ciency of the industry's mass- produced PERC s
