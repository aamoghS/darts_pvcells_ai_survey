n (poly- Si) layer, which utilizes the concept of tunnel selective en-gineering. Martin Green first proposed the concept of passive contact. In 1972, Green etal. [33] showed how tunneling a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) contact could increase the open- circuit voltage (Voc) by more than 60 mV over a standard pn junction. In 1981, Martin Green and his group are the first to pro-pose the passivation contact structure with doped poly- Si/SiOx/Si, and in 1983, they disclosed an 18% efficien
