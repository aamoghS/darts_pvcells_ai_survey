llization was achieved by screen printing and firing of a metal paste using an H- patterned grid design on both sides of the wafers (200°C, 30 min).2.2   |   CharacterizationThe currentvoltage (IV) parameters were measured using a vision tester. The implied Voc (iVoc) values of the controlled samples were determined by a lifetime tester under 1- sun il-lumination (WCT- 120 Sinton, Boulder, CO, USA). The J0 and J0,metal values of the samples were measured by WCT- 120 Sinton and extracted at
