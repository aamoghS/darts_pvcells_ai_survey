 the next mass production of solar cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was focused on the effect of different pas-sivated contact layers with respect to their influence on the J0, J0,metal, ρc, and the carrier selectivity (S10). At the same time, we simulated three types of solar cell (PERC, TOPCon and SHJ), which consisted of screen- printed metallic contacts on both sides fabricated from 182 m× 182 × 0.14 mm Cz- Si wafers through an industrial- type process; further investigated t
