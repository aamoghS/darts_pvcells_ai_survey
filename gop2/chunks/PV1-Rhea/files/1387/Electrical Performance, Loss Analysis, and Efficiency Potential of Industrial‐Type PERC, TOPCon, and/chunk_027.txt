983 by Hamakawa etal. in the form of an a- Si:H/poly- Si heterojunction bottom cell in a tan-dem junction solar cell, called honeymoon cell [55]. At the same time, the electronic junction between doped a- Si:H and c- Si was largely investigated [56]. In the late 1980s, Sanyo (Japan) started to incorporate heterojunctions into c- Si wafer- based solar cells. In recent years, SHJ technology has gained increas-ing attention within the PV industry due to their high efficiency, low- temperature proc
