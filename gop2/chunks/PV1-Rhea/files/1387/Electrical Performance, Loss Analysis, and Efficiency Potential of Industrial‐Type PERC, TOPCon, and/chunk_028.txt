ue to their high efficiency, low- temperature processes, good temperature coefficients, and high bifacial rates [57Â–60]. In 2022, LONGi raised the world re-cord power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 26.81% (274cm2, M6 size) [61], approaching the fundamental limit of single- junction Si solar cells (29.4%) [62]. In 2023, interdigitated back- contact (IBC) structure was combined with the SHJ solar cells, reaching a record PCE of 27.09% [63]. In 2024, LONGi has set a new re-cord for PCE for silicon
