SHJ > PERC.An analysis of the three types of solar cells using SunsVoc measurements is shown in Table4. The SHJ solar cell has a high pEff of 26.2% owing to its high Voc and pFF, followed by 26% of TOPCon and finally 23.9% of PERC without consid-ering the loss of series resistance. This is consistent with the trend of IV parameters. Mainly due to a high Voc of 748 mV in SHJ, it is attributed to a decrease of 8 fA/cm2 in J01 compared with TOPCon and a decrease of 56 fA/cm2 in J01 compared wi
