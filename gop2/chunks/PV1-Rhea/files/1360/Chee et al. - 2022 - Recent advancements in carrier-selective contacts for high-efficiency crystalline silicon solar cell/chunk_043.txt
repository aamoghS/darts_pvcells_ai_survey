ECL, monofacial [18,19] and bifacial [20] SHJ with a-Si:H(n/p) passivation, IBC-POLO [45,46], and TOPCon [24,25] structures. The industrial prospects for these solar cell technologies have also been reviewed [8,10,11,20]. However, the transition from Al-BSF to PERC architectures, and in the near future, possible industry alternatives to mainstream technology, remain elusive. Therefore, the prospects for HIT, POLO, hybrid IBC-SHJ, and TOPCon technologies, are broadly reviewed in terms of industri
