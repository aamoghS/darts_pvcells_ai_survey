tively, on an n-Si wafer, were characterized as having a low temperature coefficient of the efficiency [40], thereby indicating effective mitigation of thermal losses. Efficiencies above 22% can be achieved (e.g., ref. [30, 40], etc.), with a high value reported so far of 22.1% [41] and 23.5% [38] for the electro
