passivating contacts, also known as hetero

contacts, are new industrially-favored technologies. The back contact losses related to the c-Si solar cell are crucial factors accounting for the decline in V
oc 
and efficiency [57,75]. In terms of reducing back contact recombination losses as well as increasing the electron-selectivity and hole-blocking capabilities in which the relative barrier height is essen
