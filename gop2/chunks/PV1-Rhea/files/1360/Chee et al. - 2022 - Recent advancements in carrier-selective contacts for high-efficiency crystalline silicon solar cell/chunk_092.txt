 within the following year (see Fig. 4) [41]. For these reasons, TiO
x 
is by far most commonly employed for ECLs at present. The progression from using single-layer TiO
x 
film [26] to bilayer SiO

/TiO

for back contact passivation [41,80] reduces J

remarkably. The conversion efficiency and architecture evolution of c-Si solar cells with full-area electron-selective TiO

contacts (without the a-Si:H layer) are shown in Fig. 4. Hence, the dopant-free CSC derived from TiO

is
