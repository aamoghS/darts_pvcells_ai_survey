of 741mV, superior to that of p-poly-Si [183]. The results may be ascribed to the higher level of surface passivation quality enabled by n-poly-Si compared to that of p-poly-Si [184]. Hence, the n-poly-Si capped by a TCD layer/stack is industrially favorable since not only does this improve surface passiv
