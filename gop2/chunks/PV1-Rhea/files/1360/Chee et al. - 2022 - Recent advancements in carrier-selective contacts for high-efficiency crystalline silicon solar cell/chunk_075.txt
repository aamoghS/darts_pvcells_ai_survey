66,68â€“71] are most promising due to the similar requisites for organic and inorganic absorbers not only to serve as the HCL for SHJ cells [72,73], but also for organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells [74]. Fig. 2 shows the metal (oxide/salt) IL thickness dependence of the contact resistance, with minimal values expected for thinner la
