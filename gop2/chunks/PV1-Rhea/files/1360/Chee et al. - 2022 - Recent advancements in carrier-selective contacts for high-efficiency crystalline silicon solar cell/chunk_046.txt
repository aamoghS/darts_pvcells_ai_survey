 of the poly- Si absorber surface below the unpassivated metal electrode endows ECL/HCL characteristics depending on the doping type. Among key selection criteria are superior carrier selectivity, thermal stability, and contact resistivity. The high cost burden of PECVD or LPCVD, the use of flammable and pyrophoric silane, and toxic sources such as diborane and phosphine for doping, as well as parasitic absorption and limited lateral conduction, fundamentally constrain the industry incorporation
