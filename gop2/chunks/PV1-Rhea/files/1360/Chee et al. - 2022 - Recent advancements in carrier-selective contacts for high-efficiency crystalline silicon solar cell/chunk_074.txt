ation, the use of elemental extremely-low-WF alkaline earth metal/post-transition metal candidates such as Mg, Ca, or Al, is generally very attractive for back contact fabrication on n-type c-Si solar cells. Inspired by hybrid organic-inorganic electronics, organic films, such as those based on Spiro-OMeTAD [61], TAPC [62], and PEDOT:PSS[63], have been investigated for hole-selective contacts on planar c-Si sub

strates. Otherwise, as have been researched for organic solar cells [64], high-WF (
