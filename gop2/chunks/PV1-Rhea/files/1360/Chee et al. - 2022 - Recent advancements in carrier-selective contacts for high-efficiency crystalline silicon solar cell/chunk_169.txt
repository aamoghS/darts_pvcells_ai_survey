featured the best passivation, its applicability in high volume manufacturing is limited because of its high thermal budget requisite. A low-temperature (~40

C) chemical oxide passivation process based on using sodium hypochlorite solution (NCPRE-oxide) was proposed as feasible for industrial-scale implementation due to its low cost, low thermal budget, convenient waste disposal, an
