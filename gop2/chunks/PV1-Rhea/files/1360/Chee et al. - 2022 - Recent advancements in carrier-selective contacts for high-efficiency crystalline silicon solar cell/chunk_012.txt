 sustainable energy conservation efforts, and especially promising is the low levelized cost of electricity comparable with that of fossil-fuel and on-shore wind-based technologies when adopting thin silicon wafers (<160 Âµm thick) [1]. Photovoltaics that covert solar power into usable electricity are dominantly based on homojunction crystalline silicon (c-Si) technology featuring high-temperature diffused junctions, which occupy a worldwide market share in excess of 90%. From the traditional di
