9.8%. Enhancement in the passivation thermal stability of the TiO
2 
film on the n-Si surface was elicited by the additional insertion of a thermally grown tunnel SiO
2 
layer (~1.2nm thick) between the c-Si and TiO
2 
film, so that the maximum effective surface recombination velocity further reduced to 14cm/s after annealing, thereby increasing the efficiency to 21.6%. Reproducibility of the c-Si solar cells with full-area SiO

ECL was illustrated with an average efficiency above 21.0%
