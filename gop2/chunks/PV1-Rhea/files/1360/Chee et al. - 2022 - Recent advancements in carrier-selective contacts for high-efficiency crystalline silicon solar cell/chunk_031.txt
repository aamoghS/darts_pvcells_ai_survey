uld enter industry to compete with PERC on a cost-performance basis. In SHJ cell production, the charge carrier selectivity of the electron (hole) collecting layer (or ECL/HCL) may also be achieved by deposited thin films of a different material that has a workfunction (WF) offset compared to that of the absorber material so that the potential difference at the absorber surface enables charge collection. In particular, very thin buffer dielectric layers are further inserted beneath the ECL/HCL f
