tions and BSF yield PCEs that are chiefly bottlenecked by the high charge carrier recombination losses at the metal-Si contact regions [3,9]. Thus, the implementation of passivation and local contact strategies to ensure superb lateral conductivity is a complex technical problem involving the two-fold objectives of overcoming recombination losses and maintain
