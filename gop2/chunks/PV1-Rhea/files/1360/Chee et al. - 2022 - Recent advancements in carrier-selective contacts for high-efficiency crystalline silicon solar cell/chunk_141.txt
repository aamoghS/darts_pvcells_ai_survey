x 
IL is associated with dissociation of MoO
x
, thus giving rise to significant parasitic ab

sorption [146] and an energy barrier that impedes hole transport to the contact [77,144,146]. Hence, the degradation of the MoO
x 
film caused by a decrease in O content lowers its WF and leads to optical and resistance losses. Recently, oxygen diffusion was observed across the c-Si/MoO
x 
or a-Si:H(i)/MoO
x 
interface, eventually forming a sub-stochiomet
