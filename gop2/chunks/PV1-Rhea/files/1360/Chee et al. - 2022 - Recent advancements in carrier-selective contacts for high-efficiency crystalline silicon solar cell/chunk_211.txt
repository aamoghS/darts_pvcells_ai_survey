ined by low-temperature PECVD and ALD fabrication of the passivated TCD, providing maximal cell efficiency at minimum production cost. 5.Concluding remarks A wide range of CSC development pathways with lithographic back contacts has been reported to tackle the limited photovoltage and contact-related losses in mainstream solar cells. For doped a-Si:H-based CSCs, parasitic absorption, defect-assisted recombination, Auger recombination, and band gap narrowing losses, are the main loss mechanisms.
