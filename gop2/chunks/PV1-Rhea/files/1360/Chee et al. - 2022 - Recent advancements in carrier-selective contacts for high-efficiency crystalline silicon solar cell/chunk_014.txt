ology has been important for the success of the c-Si photovoltaics industry over the last decade, the limited power conversion efficiency (PCE â‰¤20%) is mainly due to the high carrier recombination velocity at the rear surface [4,5]. Indeed, heavily doped emitter materials, which have either been diffused or deposited, have been used to realize carrier selectivity (see Fig. 1a), and enhance contact properties. Moreover, what has become a promising solution for the mainstream c-Si photovoltaics
