e TCOs can play a vital role in the solar cell structure along with the dielectric stack, guaranteeing maximum light coupling into the c-Si absorber and efficient lateral charge transport to the contacts, as well as ensuring a low contact resistance. The adoption of highly transparent and electrically conductive materials combined with dielectric stacks for surface passivation and carrier-selective purposes, fit well into the industrial framework and feature a commitment to low optical losses, a
