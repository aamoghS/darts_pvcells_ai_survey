on metal contaminants and induced/introduced defects [49,50]. Hence, compared to p-Si substrates, n-type float-zone (Fz)-Si or even Czochralski-grown (Cz)-Si posseses superior minority carrier diffusion lengths so that bulk recombination losses are smaller. Moreover, the avoidance of considerable light-induced degradation is an advantage, unlike for p-type Cz-Si due to boron-oxygen pairs [51,52]. While doped a-Si:H dielectrics have been important for efficiency enhancement in all SHJ technologie
