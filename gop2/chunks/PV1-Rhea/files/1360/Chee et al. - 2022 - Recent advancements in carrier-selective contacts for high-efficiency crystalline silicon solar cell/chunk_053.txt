unted for together with CSCs with or without doping, through industry technology evolution from metal BSF to PERC, HIT, POLO, IBC-SHJ and TOPCon. The built-in field formed by the dielectric passivation layer has a crucial effect on the substrate-dielectric interface passivation. Population control of the charge carriers is determined by this built-in field at the hetero- interface, which in turn governs J
