stack do not degrade under concentrated sunlight [181]. Alternatively, doped poly-Si provides superior passivation quality for metal contacts compared to that found on mainstream diffused c-Si/ AlO

interfaces [182]. These poly-Si-based CSCs feature an interfacial oxide between the wafer and doped poly-Si, and are a
