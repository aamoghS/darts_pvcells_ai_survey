tric stacks also afford excellent passivation and simultaneous electron-selective properties on the n-type SHJ solar cell [124,125]. Finally, electron-selective, passivating contacts based on SiO
x
/n-poly-Si have also been reported [10,11,96], which are able to overcome high D
it 
and dopant diffusion issues, etc. Charge transfer from monocrystalline-Si to poly-Si through the ultrathin SiO
x 
layer is possible while the doping present in the poly-Si increases the conductivity, thereby represent
