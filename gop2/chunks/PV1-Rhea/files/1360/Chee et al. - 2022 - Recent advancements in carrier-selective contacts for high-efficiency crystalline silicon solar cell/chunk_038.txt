based ECLs in a partial rear contact structure, efficiencies have reached as high as 24.1%, comparable to that using selective phosphorus-diffused emitters of state-of-the-art commercial cells [42]. In efficient DASH solar cells, surface accumulation is induced by a thin dielectric layer using fixed charges of opposite
