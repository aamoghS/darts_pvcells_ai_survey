sivation interface layer (IL) between the rear silicon surface and doped poly-Si contact layer. This temperature stability is compatible with mainstream high- temperature screen-print metallization [21]. Alternatively, tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells adopt ultrathin (~ 1nm) tunnel SiO
