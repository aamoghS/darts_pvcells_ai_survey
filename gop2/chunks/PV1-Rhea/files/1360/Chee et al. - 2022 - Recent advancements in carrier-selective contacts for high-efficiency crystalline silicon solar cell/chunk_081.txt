 the TMO (e.g., TiO

)/p-Si than for the Al/p-Si Schottky diode [78]. The low barrier height for electrons and large barrier height for holes allow effective electron conduction, and the simultaneous back contact passivation facilitates majority carrier transport by diffusion in n-type SHJ solar cells. The one-diode current equation after Shockleyâ€™s theory shows the dependence on temperature
