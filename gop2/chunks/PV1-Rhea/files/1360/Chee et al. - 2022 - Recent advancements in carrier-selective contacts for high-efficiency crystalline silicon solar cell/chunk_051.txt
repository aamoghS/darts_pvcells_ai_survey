duction en route to the respective contacts [12,30],[40,43,44]. Through Eq. 1, it can be seen that the effective charge modulation at the surface is directly proportional to the dielectric constant of the nanostructure passivation layer. Therefore, for efficient electrical passivation, high-k dielectrics are highly effective pa
