vating contacts and hybrid heterojunction (HJ) technologies have recently emerged. Compared to mainstream technology, record-level efficiency solar cells combine the most successful HJs and field-passivated IBCs. Hybrid SHJ solar cells may adopt front side diffused contacts and rear asymmetric CSCs. In addition to the simplicity of contact fabrication, the induced band-bending, electric field, and charge transport mechanisms, are important considerations for optimal photovoltaic performance. Not
