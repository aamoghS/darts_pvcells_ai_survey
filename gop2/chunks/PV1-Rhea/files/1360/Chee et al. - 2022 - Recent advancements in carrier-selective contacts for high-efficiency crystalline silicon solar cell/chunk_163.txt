iciency upgrades have been due to passivation efforts to reduce recombination losses in the bulk as well as at the front and rear surfaces. To mitigate bulk recombination and contact losses, the use of thin wafer designs and advanced passivating IL schemes with high performance stability and production scalability have emerged. Thicker ITO layer coatings may reduce electrical resistivity losses, but other issues could arise such as increasing optical losses and production costs. A progressive ap
