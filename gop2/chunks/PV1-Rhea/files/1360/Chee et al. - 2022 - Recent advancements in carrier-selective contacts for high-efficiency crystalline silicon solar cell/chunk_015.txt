ng solution for the mainstream c-Si photovoltaics industry is the adoption of passivating contacts, also known as carrier-selective contacts (CSCs), which are thin films or stacks within the contact structure on the surface of the c-Si absorber that suppress surface carrier recombination and enhance charge carrier selectivity by providing a low contact resistivity to elec
