ocessable transparent passivating stacks that act as carrier-selective contacts (CSCs) is highlighted for their potential in circumventing the limited open-circuit photovoltage and contact- related losses in mainstream solar cells. In this review, effective passivation schemes deploying materials ranging from undoped metal oxides (MOs) to doped silicon are evaluated, with a focus on their significance for industrially viable passivating contact development. Passivation stack architectures with S
