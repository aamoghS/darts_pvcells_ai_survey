grating advanced CSC strategies with mainstream processes for c-Si solar cell technologies. Importantly, the physical properties of nanostructure passivating materials, such as the thickness and dielectric constant, bear significant influence on the surface energy band structure or interfacial electric fields to induce charge accumulation or deplete charges at the surface. The built-in f
