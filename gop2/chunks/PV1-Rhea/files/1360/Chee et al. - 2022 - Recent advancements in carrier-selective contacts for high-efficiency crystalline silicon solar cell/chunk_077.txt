x 
can be implemented to collect holes in both n- and p-type c-Si absorbers. However, charge carrier injection and recombination at defect sites are known to affect electrical transport properties. Afterwards, Bullock et al. [76] investigated LiF

, respectively, for electron- and hole-selective asymmetric heterocontacts, together with a-Si:H(i) membrane passivation on both sides of the SHJ solar cell. The band-bending near the MoO
