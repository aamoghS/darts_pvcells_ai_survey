Ad(1)  where Q
eff 
is effective charge density,

is dielectric permittivity, d is thickness, and A is area. Structural parameters such as the ratio of the contact area to passivation area, and the physical properties of the passivation material stack, have a tremendous influence on charge carrier selectivity. These parameters have been carefully accounted for together with CSCs with or without dopin
