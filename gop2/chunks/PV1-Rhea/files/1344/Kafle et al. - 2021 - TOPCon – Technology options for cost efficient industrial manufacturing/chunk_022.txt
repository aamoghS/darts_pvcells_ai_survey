ssful demonstration of the process functionality. A LCOE sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the minimum gain in conversion efficiency needed for TOPCon concepts in order to remain competitive against the bifacial p-PERC benchmark at LCOE level. 3.LPCVD based TOPCon routes To date, industrial screen-printed TOPCon solar cells on n-type substrates are based on LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si deposition technology. Typically, silicon layers that are predominantly amorphous in nature are first deposit
