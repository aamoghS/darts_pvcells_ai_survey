also included in the ‘Metallization’ category. A significantly higher metallization cost is required for TOPCon cells, mainly due to the requirement of printing Ag- based grids on both sides to form contacts with low contact resistivity. In fact, a huge share of process consumables costs in COO of a TOPCon cell is predominantly related to a high Ag consumption during metallization. Thus, in order to further lower COO of a TOPCon cell, significant reduction in Ag consumption is required. More
