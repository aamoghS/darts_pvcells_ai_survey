equired for rear tabbing of PERC cells remain unchanged. COO of the metallization step dips dramatically for both cell types with lowering consumable costs related to Ag. Nevertheless, the slope is much higher for the TOPCon cells due to their usage of Ag on both front and rear contacts. It is interesting to note that if the metallization concepts in future allow 50% reduction in Ag usage, metallization costs of TOPCon cells are on-par with PERC cells, with former potentially even achieving lowe
