ainst PERC For TCO calculations, average production efficiencies of 23.0% and 23.5% are assumed for PERC and TOPCon cells respectively, for a green- field production with an annual production output of 5000 MWp/a. To account for uncertainties in the performed bottom-up TCO calculation featuring numerous input parameters for each processing step, we ac

count an uncertainty margin of Â±10% for the COO result of each of the individual process steps that are already in use in mass production, i.e.
