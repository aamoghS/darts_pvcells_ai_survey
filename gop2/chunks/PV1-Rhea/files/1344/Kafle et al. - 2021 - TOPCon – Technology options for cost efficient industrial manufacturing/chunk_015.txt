solar cell architecture, and analyze their competitiveness to the mainstream bifacial PERC cell in terms of cell/module/system costs, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for a utility-scale green field installation. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed for the selected TOPCon routes in order to identify the minimum required increment in conversion efficiency to PERC in order to reach economic competitiveness. Based on our findings, current and future technology options for the mass pr
