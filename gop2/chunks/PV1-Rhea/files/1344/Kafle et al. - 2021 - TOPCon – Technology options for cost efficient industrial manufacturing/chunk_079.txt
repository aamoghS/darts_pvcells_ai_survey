es for TOPCon cells on n- type c-Si substrate, when using either PECVD or APCVD a-Si deposition technologies, are schematically shown alongside the reference bifacial p- PERC route. Two process routes are envisioned for each PECVD and APCVD based a-Si deposition technologies, mainly based upon the perspective of single-sidedness of the deposition process. The process routes PECVD TOPCon high & APCVD TOPCon high represent the current knowledge where the wrap-around of a-Si(n) layer on front-side
