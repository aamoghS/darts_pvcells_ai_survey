g process can be optimized in such a way that a thin thermal oxide grows on top of boron emitter, and that an excellent passivation of the textured (front) side can be achieved after PECVD AlO

layer deposition. For PECVD TOPCon low & APCVD TOPCon low, CEI is followed by BSG etching as no SSE process is envisioned later for both of these process routes. After ozone cleaning and UV-TO growth, PECVD/APCVD a-Si(n) layers are deposited with excellent single-sidedness. Here, we assume the
