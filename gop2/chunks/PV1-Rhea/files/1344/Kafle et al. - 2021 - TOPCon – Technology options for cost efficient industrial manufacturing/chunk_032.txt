chemical inline tool. Ozone cleaning oxidizes the silicon surface, the oxide then being removed with a final HF-dip before the surface passivation steps. Advanced passivation of front and rear side is envisioned by growing thin thermal silicon oxide of about 2 nm before passivation of rear (PECVD AlO
