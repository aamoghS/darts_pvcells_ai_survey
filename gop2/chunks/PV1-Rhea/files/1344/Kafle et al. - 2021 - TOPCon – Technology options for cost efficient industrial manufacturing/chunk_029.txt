if in-situ phosphorus- doped layers are deposited instead of intrinsic a-Si layers. Here, one of the major cost driving factors is the reduced throughput of the LPCVD tool due to a significantly longer process duration, which directly increases all the fixed costs. A small cost contribution of additional PH
