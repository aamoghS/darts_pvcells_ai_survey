re the wrap-around of a-Si(n) layer on front-side needs to be removed by using a single-sided etching (SSE) process. For PECVD TOPCon low & APCVD TOPCon low, both a-Si deposition technologies are assumed to offer an excellent single-sidedness so that no SSE process is required after the high temperature annealing of the a-Si layer. In all four cases, the tunnel oxide is formed by coupling an UV excimer lamp array (UV-TO) [23] with the wet-chemical tool used for chemical edge isolation (CEI), BSG
