n methods are principally applicable in PV manufacturing, their choice largely depends upon the used a-Si/poly-Si deposition technology. 4.2.Deposition of a-Si layer Typically, a-Si layers are first deposited and then subjected to a high temperature annealing step in order to form poly-Si layer. Depending upon the deposition technology, the doping of poly-Si is performed either during the deposition process (in-situ) or by a follow up diffusion process (ex-situ). Importantly, the choice of a-Si
