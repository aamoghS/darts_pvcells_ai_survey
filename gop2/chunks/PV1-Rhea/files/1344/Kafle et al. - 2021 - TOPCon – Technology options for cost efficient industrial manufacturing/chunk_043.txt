:H is also deposited on top of poly-Si layer in the rear side as a hydrogenation source. For LPCVD TOPCon insitu, the deposition of phosphorus doped LPCVD layers is followed in an inline wet-chemical tool to perform SSE of a-Si layer on the front-side, with a subsequent BSG etching and ozone-based wet-chemical cleaning.
