an n-type c-Si substrate with boron (p
+
) emitter on the textured (front) side. The front side is passivated by a dielectric stack of passivation and anti-reflection layer. The rear side with either textured/semi-polished or polished surface features tunnel oxide and doped polysilicon layer acting as passivating carrier-selective contact, stacked with amorphous hydrogenated silicon nitride (a-SiN
x
) layer as the source of hydrogenation to passivate the dangling bonds in Siâ€“SiO
