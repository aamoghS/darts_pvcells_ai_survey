ction lines as the potential next evolutionary solar cell technology upgrade to PERC. In this work, we aim to devise cost-driven strategies towards mass manufacturing of TOPCon-based solar cells using bottom-up total cost of ownership (TCO) calculations of individual process steps in the PV value chain and the associated cell processing routes. Based on the available literature, feedback from industry, and technological developments at Fraunhofer ISE, we first discuss the up-to-now industrialize
