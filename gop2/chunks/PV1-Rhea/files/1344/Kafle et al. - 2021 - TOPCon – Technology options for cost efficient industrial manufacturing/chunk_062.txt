cells, with former potentially even achieving lower watt-peak costs ($/Wp) due to a higher cell power. In summary, the TCO in cell level is significantly higher for TOPCon concept in comparison to p-PERC cell. Nevertheless, LPCVD TOPCon insitu route offers lower COO between the two investigated LPCVD- based TOPCon routes. 4.Alternative TOPCon process routes As mentioned earlier, deposition of a-Si layer is one of the most important process steps required to realize a TOPCon solar cell. Although
