om c-Si towards the metal contacts through the doped poly-Si layer. The stoichiometry and the thickness of the oxide layer mainly determine the thermal stability of the layer, which is a crucial aspect considering the current PV manufacturing process route that features several high temperature steps [23,24]. Table 1 outlines the available processes in literature and important characteristics to consider while choosing the method. The oxides are formed either by wet-chemical or dry methods. Amon
