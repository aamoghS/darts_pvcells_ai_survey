 methods to form tunnel oxide and deposit a-Si layer are briefly summarized, as these steps are vital towards designing the subsequent cell processing steps. 4.1.Tunnel oxide formation A thin interfacial oxide layer is grown on c-Si surface before depos

iting either intrinsic or doped amorphous silicon layers. The oxide layer not only provides an excellent passivation of c-Si surface, but also allows the transport of majority charge carriers from c-Si towards the metal contacts through the dop
