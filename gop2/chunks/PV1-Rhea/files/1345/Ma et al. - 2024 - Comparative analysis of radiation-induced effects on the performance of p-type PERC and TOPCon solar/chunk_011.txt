7]. As the bulk lifetime of c-Si wafers has improved over time, the recombination of charge carriers at the cell surfaces and contacts has become a major obstacle to further enhancing cell efficiency. In this regard, the Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) technology has been proposed as a solution for the next-generation industrial high-efficiency silicon solar cells [8]. The TOPCon contact significantly reduces recombination losses for minority carriers while providing a low resistance fo
