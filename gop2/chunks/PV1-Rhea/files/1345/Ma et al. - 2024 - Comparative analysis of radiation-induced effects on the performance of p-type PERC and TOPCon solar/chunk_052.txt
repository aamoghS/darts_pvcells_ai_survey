efficiency increase of 1 % absolute was observed for both PERC and p-TOPCon configurations. 3.4.Radiation-induced defects Solar cells deployed in space are subject to degradation induced by high energy particles from the solar wind, comprising primarily protons and electrons of varying energy levels. The displacement damage dose (DDD) methodology, pioneered by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) [26], is well suited to the analysis of silicon solar cells since the Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (
