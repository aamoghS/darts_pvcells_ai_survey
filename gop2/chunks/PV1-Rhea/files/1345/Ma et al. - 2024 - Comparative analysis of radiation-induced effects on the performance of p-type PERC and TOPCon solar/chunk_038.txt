:H) with a thickness of 10 nm, as determined through a detailed analysis of reflectivity data spanning the range of 400â€“1000 nm as shown in Fig. 2(b). For the subsequent electrical simulations, a 2D unit cell, depicted in Fig. 2(a), was employed. The n-type substrate was found to have a resistivity of approximating 1.3 cm.
