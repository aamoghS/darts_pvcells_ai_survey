s(2) The bulk lifetime depends on the interplay of SRH, Auger, and radiative recombination mechanisms within the substrate. Following the successful permanent deactivation of BO defects, the manifestation of SRH recombination can be effectively captured through the modelling of a mid-bandgap defect, characterized by an electron-to-hole capture cross-section ratio of 12. This relationship implies that
