architectures undergo comprehensive examination, incorporating various doping concentrations and a range of 1 MeV electron fluences. The results presented in this work are worst-case results as they do not take any bulk defect recovery mechanism into account, so their actual performance may be significantly better. 2.Simulation setup The Sentaurus TCAD software package [9] was utilized to perform comprehensive optical and electrical simulations on both the PERC and TOPCon solar cell structures.
