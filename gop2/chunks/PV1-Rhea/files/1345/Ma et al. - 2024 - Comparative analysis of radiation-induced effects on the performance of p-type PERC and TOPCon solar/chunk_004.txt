nt compensation contributes to an increase in series resistance. Specifically, for PERC cells, the challenge of elevated series resistance is further exacerbated by the requirement for majority carriers to traverse both vertically and laterally to reach the rear metal contact. When a robust defect recovery mechanism or resilient cover glass is absent, substrates characterized by lower doping levels display increased susceptibility to the adverse effects of radiation-induced defects and the subse
