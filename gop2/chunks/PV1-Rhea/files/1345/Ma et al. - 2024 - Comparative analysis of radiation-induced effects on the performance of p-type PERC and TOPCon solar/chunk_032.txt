ements, was conducted across a dataset comprising over 20 M4 size PERC solar cells, featuring five busbars and 106 front fingers. The results from a representative PERC cell were employed for subsequent modelling. Due to the inherent symmetry of solar cell structures, the optical simulation unit cell was reduced to a 3D domain, encompassing just one-quarter of a pyramid. Furthermore, for electrical simulations, the unit cell was further simplified into a 2D domain, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The
