 Earth orbit (LEO) are exposed to an array of environmental factors. Among these, a prominent factor is the continuous barrage of high-energy particles, primarily encompassing electrons ranging from 40 keV to 7 MeV and protons spanning from 100 keV to 400 MeV [20]. The slowing of these particles within the active semiconductor creates displacement damage and hence the generation of point defects. This computational study considers the detrimental consequences of high-energy particle irradiation
