flection. The settings for the front ARC and rear diffuse reflection were determined by reflectivity measurements. Subsequently, the 3D distribution of absorbed photons, following calibration, was transformed into a one-dimensional (1D) optical generation profile, a format suitable for utilization in subsequent two-dimensional (2D) electrical simulations. To ensure accurate predictions, state-of-the-art models were employed during the electrical simulation phase [10]. A summary of typical settin
