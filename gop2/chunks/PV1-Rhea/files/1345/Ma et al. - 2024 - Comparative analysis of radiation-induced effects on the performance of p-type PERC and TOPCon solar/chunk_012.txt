ority carriers while providing a low resistance for majority carriers. The TOPCon technology is also designed to be compatible with existing solar cell manufacturing lines, facilitating its rapid adoption by solar cell manufacturers. Both commercially available p-type PERC cells and n-type TOPCon (n-TOPCon) cells are readily accessible. While cost considerations play a pivotal role, it is equally vital to determine the most optimal technology concerning both beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-li
