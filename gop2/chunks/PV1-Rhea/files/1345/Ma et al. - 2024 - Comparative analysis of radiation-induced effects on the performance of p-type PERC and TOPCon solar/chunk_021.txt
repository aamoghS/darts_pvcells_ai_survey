(1) The capture cross section for electrons is estimated to be tenfold that of holes. Consequently, the hole lifetime (

. The BO defects were eventually brought under control, and a viable avenue for their permanent deactivation was established via carrier injection at elevated temperatures [14]. As an alternative, the utilization of gallium (Ga) doping for p-type substrates emerged as a viable strategy to c
