 the optical benefits derived from light trapping. This presents a supplementary uncertainty concerning the texture ratio. The distinctive concave trend observed in the EQE data between 400 and 800 nm is likely linked to the ARC stack. A decline in EQE response beyond 800 nm suggests limited photon absorption (associated with high photon rejection) for longer wavelengths. This behaviour aligns with the design of BSFR, which effectively reflects longer-wavelength photons back into space. The abse
