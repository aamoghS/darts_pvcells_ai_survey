sistance, as the majority carriers must diffuse laterally to the localized contacts according to Fig. 1(a). 4.Summary For the context of space applications, a comprehensive numerical evaluation is undertaken to assess the viability of both c-Si PERC and TOPCon solar cell technologies. Commencing with industrial PERC and n-TOPCon cells, meticulous calibration procedures are implemented, primarily concerning recombination parameters, by aligning them with the experimentally determined QE and Iâ€“V
