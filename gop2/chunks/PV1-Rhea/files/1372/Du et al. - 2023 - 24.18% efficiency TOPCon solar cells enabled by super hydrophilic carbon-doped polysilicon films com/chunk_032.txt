e plating solution and reduce the surface energy which is conducive to the escape of hydrogen during the plating process to obtain a more uniform and dense seed layer. In this section, the physical morphology of Ni seed layers plated on the C-free and C-doped polysilicon films was characterized by optical and laser confocal microscopy, as shown in Fig. 3(c)-3(f). For the Ni seed layer formed on C-free polysilicon film, a considerable number of voids can be observed, which can be attributed to th
