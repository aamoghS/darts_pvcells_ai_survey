tive, plating the metal electrodes directly on the polysilicon films is more desirable to fabricate the TOPCon devices as it could avoid using the costly vacuum physical vapor deposition (PVD) to deposit the metal seed layers. However, it is still challenging to adopt the copper plating technology in mass production
