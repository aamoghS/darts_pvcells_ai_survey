ALD) and PECVD, respectively. After defining the front electrode pattern by photolithography, the Ti/Pd/Ag seed layer was deposited by electron-beam evaporation and then it was thickened by plating. The pattern of the Ni/Cu/Sn electrode with a line width of 15

m on the rear side of the devices was defined using photolithography. Then, the Ni layer served as a seed layer, and a barrier layer for Cu was directly plated on the polysilicon film at a current density of 30 mA/cm
