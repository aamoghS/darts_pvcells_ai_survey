tion quality of lifetime samples with the double-layer polysilicon structure under the different annealing temperatures was comprehensively evaluated, where the structure of the double-layer polysilicon lifetime samples is shown in Fig. 4(a). The passivation quality of the samples with double-layer structure shows the same change trend as that of the C-free polysilicon samples under the various annealing temperatures, which, however, is almost independent of R values as shown in Fig. 4(b)-4(d).
