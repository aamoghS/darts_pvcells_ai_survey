e corresponding water contact angles decreasing as shown in Fig. 1(b)-1 (d). Notably, the polysilicon film with a relatively higher C content (i.e., R =0.75) exhibited super hydrophilicity with the water droplets completely spread on the surface. The wetting behavior of Ni electrolyte on the C-doped polysilicon was also measured, as shown in Fig. 1(e)-1 (h). As a result, the contact angles of the Ni electrolyte exhibit the same trend as the water, i.e., the contact angles of the Ni electrolyte a
