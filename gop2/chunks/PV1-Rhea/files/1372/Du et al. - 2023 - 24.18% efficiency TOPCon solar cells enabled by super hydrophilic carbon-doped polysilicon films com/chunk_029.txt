ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to examine the chemical states of the C-doped samples. The XPS spectra of C 1s are shown in Fig. 2, which can be split into three typical peaks corresponding to the C–Si (282.8 eV), C
––
C (284.8 eV), and C–O–C (286.5 eV) bonds [27]. Compared to the C-free sample in Fig. 2(a), the intensity of C
