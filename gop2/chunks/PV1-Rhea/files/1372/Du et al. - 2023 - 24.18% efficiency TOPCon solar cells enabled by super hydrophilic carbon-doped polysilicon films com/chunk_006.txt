junction (HJT) [1,2], tunneling oxide passivation contact (TOPCon) [3â€“6], and integrated-back contact (IBC) technologies [7,8]. Among them, TOPCon SC is widely recognized as one of the most promising c-Si technologies for the next-generation PV industry due to its high compatibility with the traditional passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) SCs in production lines and relatively low capital cost to upgrade the production lines [5]. However, the front- and rear-sided fingers
