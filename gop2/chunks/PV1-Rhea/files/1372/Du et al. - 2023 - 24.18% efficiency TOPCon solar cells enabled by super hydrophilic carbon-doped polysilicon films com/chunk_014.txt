 forming voids and making poor electrical properties and adhesion of the plated fingers [21â€“23]. In this work, we propose innovatively a double-layer polysilicon structure consisting of a thick carbon (C)-free polysilicon and a thin C- doped polysilicon as the electron transport layer for the TOPCon SCs, in which the C-free polysilicon has high conductivity for carrier transport and the C-doped polysilicon has good wettability for plating the Ni seed layer. The experimental results confirm tha
