terial cost [9]. Ample evidence has shown that the supply of silver is a critical factor limiting the upcoming terawatt (TW)-scaled PV market in the next decade [9]. Therefore, developing metallization schemes with low silver consumption is particularly crucial to reduce material costs and accelerate the market e
