lms for plating the Ni seed layer while maintaining the contact performance of the plated grids with the polysilicon. Compared with the C-free polysilicon, the C-doped polysilicon shows better wettability, making it easier for hydrogen to release during electroplating. Therefore, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer was obtained. By optimizing the deposition conditions and the annealing temperature, samples with the double-layer polysilicon structure show high passivation with a remarka
