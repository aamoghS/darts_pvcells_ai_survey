ids can be observed, which can be attributed to the non-uniform distribution of the plating solution and the trapping of hydrogen bubbles on the film during the plating process in Fig. 3(a) [21,23]. In contrast, the C-doped sample with better wettability allows the plating solution to spread more evenly and leads to a reduced surface tension, thus making it less susceptible to the retention of hydrogen bubbles on the surface as shown in Fig. 3(b). As a result, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni
