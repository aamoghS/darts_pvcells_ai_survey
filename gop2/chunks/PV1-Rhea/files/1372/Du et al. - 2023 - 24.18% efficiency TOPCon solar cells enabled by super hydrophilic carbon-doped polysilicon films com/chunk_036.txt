bility but also promote the quality of the polysilicon film. Previous works have confirmed that the presence of C could improve the physical contact of polysilicon/SiO
x
/c- Si structure by suppressing the blistering of polysilicon film during high- temperature annealing, maintaining high-quality H passivation by restraining H escape, regulating the diffusion profile of P dopant, and tailoring the energy alignment, which are all beneficial to promote the device performance [27,29â€“34].
