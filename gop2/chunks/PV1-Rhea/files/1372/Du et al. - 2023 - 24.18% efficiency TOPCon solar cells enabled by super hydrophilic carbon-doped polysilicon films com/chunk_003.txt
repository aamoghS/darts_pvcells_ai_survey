ct (TOPCon) solar cells (SCs). In this work, we propose a carbon (C)-doped polysilicon with highly polar Câ€“Si bonds to improve the surface wettability of polysilicon film. By reducing the hydrogen bubble retention during plating, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer can be obtained. To maintain the good conductivity of polysilicon, a double- layer polysilicon structure consisting of a C-doped and a C-free polysilicon films was constructed for TOPCon device fabrication. The new design
