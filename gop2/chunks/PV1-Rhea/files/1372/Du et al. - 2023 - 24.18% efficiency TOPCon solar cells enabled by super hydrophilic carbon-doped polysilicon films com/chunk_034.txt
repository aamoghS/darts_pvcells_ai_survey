. As a result, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer is formed on the C-doped polysilicon film as can be seen from Fig. 3(d) and (f). Our previous studies have shown that the presence of C severely degrades the conductivity of the polysilicon films [27], which will in turn affect the uniformity of the current distribution during plating. Herein, we propose a double-layer polysilicon structure as the electron transport layer of the TOPCon SCs, i.e., a C-free polysilicon layer covered by a
