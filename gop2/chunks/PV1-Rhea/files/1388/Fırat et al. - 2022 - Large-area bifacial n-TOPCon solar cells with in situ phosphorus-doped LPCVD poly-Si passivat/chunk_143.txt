 simplification of the process used for fabricating n-TOPCon solar cells will be targeted by developing fired passivating contacts based on the in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films used in this work, thereby skipping the post-LPCVD annealing process. Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge Sukhvinder Singh from Imec and Rajiv Sharma from KU Leuven for the valuable discussions and their help with the sample fabrication.
