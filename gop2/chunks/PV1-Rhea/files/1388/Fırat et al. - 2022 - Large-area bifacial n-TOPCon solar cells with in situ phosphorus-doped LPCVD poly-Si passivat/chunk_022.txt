 roadmap is provided which shows how the efficiency of n-TOPCon solar cells featuring in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD can be further improved starting from the baseline established in this work. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Integration of In Situ Doped LPCVD Poly-Si Passivating Contacts in n-TOPCon Solar Cells The in situ P-doped LPCVD-based poly-Si films developed in [26] were integrated in n-TOPCon solar cells in two sets of experiments. The goal of the first experiment was to study the
