ulting in an average η of 22.4%. This was found to be mainly due to improved light trapping at the rear side, increasing Jsc by 0.5 mA/cm2. The electrical performance of the passivating contact also improved on the polished surface, yielding J0,p,r = 2.3 fA/cm2, J0,m,r = 65.8 fA/cm2, and ρc,r = 2.0 mΩ∙cm2. A further gain in Jsc by 0.5 mA/cm2 was then obtained by applying a double ARC to the front surface of the devices, in the form of an additional SiOx layer on top of the SiNx layer, which
