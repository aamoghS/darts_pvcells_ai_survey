 poly-Si films [17–22]. Nevertheless, the applications considered in these studies are mainly not associated with PV. In fact, the number of publications on the fabrication of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films has been limited due to challenges arising from combining LPCVD with in situ P-doping, which has made ex situ doping the preference of the PV industry so far [23–25]. The main challenge is to achieve a high active doping level (ND,act) in the depo
