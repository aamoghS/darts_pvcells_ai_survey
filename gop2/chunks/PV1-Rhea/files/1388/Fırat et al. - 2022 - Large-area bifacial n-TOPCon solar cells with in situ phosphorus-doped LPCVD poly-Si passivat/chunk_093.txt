 the 0.5 mA/cm2 increase in Jsc. Results of R and EQE measurements performed on solar cells with different rear surface morphology, depicted in Fig. 8a), reveal that the optical improvement originates from a gain in EQE at long wavelengths. This leads to the conclusion that the polished rear surface offers enhanced light trapping compared to the semi-textured one, which also explains the higher R at long wavelengths, as more light is internally reflected at the polished rear, increasing the esca
