itself is not expected to change during thermal cycling. Nevertheless, the physical mechanism behind the change in the properties of the interconnections is not well-understood. 4 Roadmap for Improving the n-TOPCon Solar Cells While a high certified Î· of 23.01% is demonstrated in this work, it is important to assess the ultimate potential of t
