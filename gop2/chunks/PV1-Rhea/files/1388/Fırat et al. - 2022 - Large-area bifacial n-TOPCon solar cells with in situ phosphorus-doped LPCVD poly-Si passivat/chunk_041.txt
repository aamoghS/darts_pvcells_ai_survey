with front illumination were repeated with the illumination intensity reduced to 7% of 1 sun. The resulting data and the data acquired under 1 sun front illumination were used together for determining the ideality factor (n) and the area-normalized series resistance (rs) by the Bowden method [34]. In addition, to gain insight into the FF losses, FF values without the impact of rs (FFn) and without the impact of both rs and non-ideal n (FF0) were calculated [34].  ï¿½The solar cells were further
