as the doping profile, which is beyond the scope of this work and will be targeted in the future.  In addition to the properties of the passivating contact at the rear, Fig. 5 reveals for the front surface that a low ρc,f = 2.1 mΩ∙cm2 can be achieved, but with a poor passivation quality as indicated by the high J0,p,f = 21.3 fA/cm2 and J0,m,f = 632.2 fA/cm2. This is expected given the lack of passivating contacts at the front side and appears to be the main factor limiting the Voc of the sol
