ower dangling bond density of (100)-oriented surfaces than the (111)-oriented facets, with the former and the latter exposed to a greater extent in case of the polished and semi-textured surfaces, respectively, and (iii) the reduction in stress related defects in the SiOx film [44]. Moreover, Fig. 9b) shows that ρc,r decreases from 2.5 mΩ∙cm2 in case of the semi-textured surface to 2.0 mΩ∙cm2 when the surface is polished, which is surprising as a higher contact resistivity would be expect
