tood. For the thermal cycling, the evolution of Pout clearly follows the FF of the laminate, as depicted in Fig. 12b). Other I-V parameters were found to remain unchanged during thermal cycling. Interestingly, FF increased significantly, by 3.1% absolute, during the first 100 cycles, after which it dropped by 1.3% absolute during the following 300 cycles. The initial FF improvement is associated with a significant drop in the series resistance of the laminate, which is attributed to modification
