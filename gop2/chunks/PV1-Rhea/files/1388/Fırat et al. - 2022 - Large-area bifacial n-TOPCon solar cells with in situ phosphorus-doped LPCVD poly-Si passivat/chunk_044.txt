together with the devices. These rear and front monitors, depicted schematically in Fig. 2a) and 2b), respectively, were designed to reproduce either the rear or the front side of the devices, allowing the passivation and contact properties of each surface to be independently investigated. As the rear surface design was 
varied during the experiments, a set of two rear monitors was fabricated for each tpoly and rear surface morphology studied. By contrast, the front surface remained the same in
