.3 suns was used. The EQE data was corrected by a wavelength-independent scaling factor so that its integration with the AM1.5 G spectrum yields the Jsc determined by the I-V measurements. These data were analyzed for understanding the differences in the optical performance of each group of solar cells.  For understanding the factors limiting the performance of the n-TOPCon solar cells, symmetrically passivated monitor samples were also prepared together with the devices. These rear and front mo
