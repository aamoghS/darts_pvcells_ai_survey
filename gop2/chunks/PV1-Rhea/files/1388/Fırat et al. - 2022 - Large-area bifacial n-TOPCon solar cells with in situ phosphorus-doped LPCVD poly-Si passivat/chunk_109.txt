 the rs does not change, even though the extra SiOx film to realize the DARC was deposited onto the Ag fingers. We speculate that the wires of the I-V measurement setup with high mechanical tension punch through the thin SiOx film on the Ag fingers and the realization of the DARC on the finished solar cells therefore does not lead to contacting issues.  Table 5. I-V parameters of n-TOPCon solar cells with single and double antireflection coating (ARC). Averages and standard deviations were obtai
