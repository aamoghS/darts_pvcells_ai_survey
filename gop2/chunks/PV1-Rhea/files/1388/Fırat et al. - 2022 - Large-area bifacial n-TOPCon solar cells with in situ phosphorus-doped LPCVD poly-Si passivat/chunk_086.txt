s of screen-printing pastes and new screens adapted to the wafer size were used for the rear surface morphology screening experiment. 3.2 Impact of Rear Surface Morphology on n-TOPCon Solar Cells For studying the impact of the rear surface morphology on the solar cell characteristics, n-TOPCon solar cells with semi-textured and polished rear surfaces were prepared. The morphologies of a fully textured surface as a reference, and the semi-textured and the polished surfaces are illustrated in the
