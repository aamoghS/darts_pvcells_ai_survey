ng as a higher contact resistivity would be expected due to the lower contact area. The reason behind this ρc,r reduction is not well-understood and given the relatively high standard deviation of 0.3 mΩ∙cm2 of the ρc,r data in case of the polished surface, the observed drop should be treated with caution and might be inconclusive.
