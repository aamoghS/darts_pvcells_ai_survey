le the simulated and the measured Jsc are perfectly matched. This is expected, since (i) accurately measuring the FF of zero-busbar devices is difficult and the measured FF can be an underestimation, particularly given the 1.1% difference between the FF determined in-house and at ISFH CalTeC as discussed in Section 3.3, and (ii) the Voc of the best solar cell suffered a 2-3 mV loss due to the contamination at the edges as discussed in Section 3.2, which is not considered in the simulations.
