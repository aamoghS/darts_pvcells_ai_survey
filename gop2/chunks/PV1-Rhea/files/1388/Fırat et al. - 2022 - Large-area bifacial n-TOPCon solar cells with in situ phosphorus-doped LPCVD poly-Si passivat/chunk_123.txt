is important to assess the ultimate potential of the n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts, as record large-area n-TOPCon solar cells fabricated by the PV industry already achieved η up to 25.4% [4]. For this purpose, a roadmap is established by Quokka 2 simulations and presented in Fig. 13, showing that, with proper design and process optimizations, solar cells with η of 25.5% can be achieved using in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts.
