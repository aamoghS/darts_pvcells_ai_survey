 experiments were compared. The design of the monitors with regions of different metallization fractions (MF) is depicted in Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 7b), the non-metallized regions of the monitor from the tpoly screening experiment are uniformly passivated, while the monitor from the rear surface morphology screening experiment, depicted in Fig. 7c), has lower PL counts i.e., darker regions at the edges. This is attributed to unexpected contamination of the edges, found to be originating from
