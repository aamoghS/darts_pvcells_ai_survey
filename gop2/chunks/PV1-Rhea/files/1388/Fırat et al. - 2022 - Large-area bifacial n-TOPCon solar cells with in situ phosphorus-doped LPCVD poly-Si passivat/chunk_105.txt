ure with a large-area n-TOPCon solar cell incorporating an in situ doped LPCVD-based poly-Si passivating contact [25]. Moreover, the achieved η is also on par with the highest certified η of 23.06% obtained in our group using the conventional ex situ doped LPCVD-based poly-Si passivating contacts (data not published yet). Second, it is important to note that the certified FF of the best solar cell is 1.1% higher than the corresponding FF measured in-house, which is attributed to the certified
