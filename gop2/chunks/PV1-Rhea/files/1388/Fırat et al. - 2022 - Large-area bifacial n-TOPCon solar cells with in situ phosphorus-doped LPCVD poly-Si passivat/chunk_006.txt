iciency of 23.01% along with a high open circuit voltage of 691.7 mV, enabled by the passivating contacts with the in situ doped poly-Si films. 1-cell glass-glass laminates were also fabricated with the developed solar cells, which showed no loss in their power output both upon 400 thermal cycles and after 1000 hours of damp heat testing. Lastly, a roadmap is presented, indicating strategies to achieve efficiencies up to 25.5% with n-TOPCon solar cells incorporating the in situ P-doped LPCVD pol
