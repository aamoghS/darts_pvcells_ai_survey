eflected at the polished rear, increasing the escape reflectance. It is important to note, however, that the use of the polished rear surface also reduces the bifaciality from 81.2±0.3% in the case of the semi-textured rear, to 78.7±0.5%. This is because of the Jsc under rear illumination decreasing by 0.8 mA/cm2 due to an increased R in the case of the polished rear surface. The impact of this drop in bifaciality on the energy yield at the PV system level requires further investigation, which
