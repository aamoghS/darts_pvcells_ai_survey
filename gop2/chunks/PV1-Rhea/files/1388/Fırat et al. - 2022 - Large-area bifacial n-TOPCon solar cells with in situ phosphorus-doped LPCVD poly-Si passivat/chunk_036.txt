o the one depicted in Fig. 1a) and the fabrication followed the process flow in Fig. 1b), with the only difference to the reference group being the strength of the single-side etch used for removing the boron-diffused emitter from the rear side. Instead of the emitter removal process, a polishing process was applied to these solar cells using the same equipment as for emitter removal but a more concentrated HF/HNO3 mixture. In more detail, the volume concentrations of 49% HF and 70% HNO3 in the
