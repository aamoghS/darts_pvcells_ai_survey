 and the polished surfaces are illustrated in the SEM images shown in Fig. 6a), 6b), and 6c) respectively. Findings of the I-V characterization of n-TOPCon solar cells with tpoly = 150 nm and the semi-textured and polished rear surface morphologies are shown in Table 4. First, comparison of the semi-textured reference group with the corresponding results in Table 3 for tpoly = 150 nm shows that the average Î· has slightly improved by 0.1%. This is due to the 0.7% jump in FF, which follows from t
