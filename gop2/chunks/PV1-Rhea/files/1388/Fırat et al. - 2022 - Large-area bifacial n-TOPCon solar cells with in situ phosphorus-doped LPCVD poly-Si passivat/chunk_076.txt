 from 100 to 150 nm, showing that passivating contacts with thicker poly-Si films preserve their carrier selectivity better against aggressive screen-printed metallization. This observation agrees with the findings of similar studies in the literature [14,15,41â€“43]. Moreover, according to Fig. 5a), J0,p,r decreases slightly, to 3.6 fA/cm2, for higher tpoly, which agrees with the trend reported in some works in the literature [14,15], while other works did not identify any trend in J0,p,r as a
