reased parasitic absorption in the heavily doped poly-Si film, mainly due to free carrier absorption (FCA). Our previous optical studies predict a linearly increasing Jsc loss as a function of tpoly when the poly-Si passivating contact is integrated at the rear side of solar cells as in this work, with the loss equal to ~0.2 mA/cm2 per 50 nm increase in tpoly [26,38]. Studies by other groups in the literature also predict similar FCA-related losses between 0.1 and 0.25 mA/cm2 per 50 nm increase
