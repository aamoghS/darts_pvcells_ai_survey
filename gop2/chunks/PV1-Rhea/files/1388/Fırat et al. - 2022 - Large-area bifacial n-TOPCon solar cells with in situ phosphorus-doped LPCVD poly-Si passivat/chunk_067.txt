es between 0.1 and 0.25 mA/cm2 per 50 nm increase in tpoly [12,15,39]. Hence, the behavior of Jsc in Table 3 as a function of tpoly can be explained with the parasitic absorption losses reported in the literature. To verify this hypothesis, R and EQE measurements were performed, yielding the results in Fig. 3. The plot on the left shows that the solar cells with different tpoly have very similar optical properties at short and visible wavelengths, while R seems to decrease with increasing tpoly
