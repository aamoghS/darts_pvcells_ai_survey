rmed, yielding the results in Fig. 4a). First, it is evident from these data that the difference between FFn and FF i.e., the loss due to series resistance of the solar cells, is significantly larger than the difference between FF0 and FFn i.e., the loss due to recombination. This is expected given the relatively high rs of 0.8 Ω∙cm2 of the solar cells, which is attributed to issues during the screen-printing process mainly due to the use of aged Ag paste, resulting in quite regularly spaced
