ing test, which took the sample repeatedly between -40°C and 85°C for 400 cycles with a cycle duration of 3 hours and a dwell time of 10 min at both temperatures. No current was applied to the laminates during thermal cycling.  �The laminates were characterized by light I-V measurements under 1 sun front illumination using the LOANA system, yielding the Voc, Jsc, FF, η, and the output power (Pout) of the laminates. The measurements were performed before and after the damp heat and thermal c
