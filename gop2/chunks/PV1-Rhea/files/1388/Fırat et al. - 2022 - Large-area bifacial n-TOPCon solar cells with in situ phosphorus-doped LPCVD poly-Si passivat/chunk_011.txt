is because the necessary phosphorus (P) doping of the Si film is realized by an ex situ method, usually dopant diffusion, after LPCVD of intrinsic Si, which makes the fabrication of the passivating contact inherently a two-step process [2]. By contrast, an alternative approach based on in situ doping can allow producing the entire passivating contact in a single step, offering the possibility of leaner fabrication.  Device integration of poly-Si passivating contacts fabricated by the standard in
