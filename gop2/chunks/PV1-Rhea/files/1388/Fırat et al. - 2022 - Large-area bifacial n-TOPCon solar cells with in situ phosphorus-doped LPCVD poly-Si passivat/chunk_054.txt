ies to improve the efficiency of the n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD-based poly-Si passivating contacts, simulations were performed using the Quokka 2 software [37]. First, a model was built to match the I-V parameters of the best solar cell with a tpoly of 150 nm, polished rear surface, and single ARC. The corresponding input parameters of this model are listed in Table 1. These values were selected based on experimental data, in case of e.g., J0,E and contact resistivity, and d
