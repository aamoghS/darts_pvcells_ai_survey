r the polished monitors, as depicted in Fig. 9a). This finding agrees with the results in the literature [5]. The observed reduction in recombination losses also explains the 1.2 mV increase in Voc of the solar cells with polished rear surface. Achievement of lower J0,p,r and J0,m,r on the flatter polished surface is attributed to three factors based on the literature: (i) the reduced surface area compared to the semi-textured surface, (ii) the lower dangling bond density of (100)-oriented surfa
