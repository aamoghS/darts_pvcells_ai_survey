 contrast, the front surface remained the same in all experiments, thus only two front monitors were prepared. Fabrication of the monitors followed the relevant steps in the process flow shown in Fig. 1b). On the monitors, the metal fingers were screen-printed only on some regions and with varying metallization fraction, while other regions were left non-metallized [26].   Passivation properties of both surfaces were investigated by performing minority carrier lifetime (Ï„) measurements on the p
