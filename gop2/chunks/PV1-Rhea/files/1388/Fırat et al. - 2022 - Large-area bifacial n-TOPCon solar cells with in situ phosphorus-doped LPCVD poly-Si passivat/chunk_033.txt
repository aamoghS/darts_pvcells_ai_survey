PECVD SiNx:H film was also applied to the rear side for improving the passivation quality provided by the passivating contact by means of hydrogenation. Fabrication of the solar cells was then completed by metallization using a zero-busbar design on both sides, leading to bifacial solar cells. The metallization fraction of the front and rear surfaces of the solar cells was 2.7% and 5%, respectively. For metallization, Ag and Ag/Al pastes were screen-printed at the rear and front sides, respectiv
