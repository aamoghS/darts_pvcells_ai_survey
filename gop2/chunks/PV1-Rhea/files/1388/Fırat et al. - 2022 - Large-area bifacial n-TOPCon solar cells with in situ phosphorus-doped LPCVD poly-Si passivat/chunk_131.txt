e 4 steps of the roadmap, relying on industrially feasible improvements only.  In step 5, implementing a DARC enhances the Jsc and the Î· by 0.6 mA/cm2 and 0.3%, respectively, in agreement with the experimental results in Table 5. It should be noted, however, that this improvement would not translate to module level due to optical losses in encapsulants and as the refractive index of the SiOx film used in the simulations as the top layer of DARC is not suitable for module applications. Lastly, s
