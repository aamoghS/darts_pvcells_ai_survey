roughput and since LPCVD equipment offers the possibility of thermally growing the interfacial SiOx film in situ [2]. While the latter feature allows process simplification by combining the deposition of the SiOx and the Si, deposited either as poly-Si or as amorphous Si (a-Si), layers in a single step, current LPCVD-based approaches in the PV industry still do not exploit the full potential of this technique in terms of process simplicity. This is because the necessary phosphorus (P) doping of
