lting in a semi-textured surface morphology with slightly rounded-off pyramids.   The fabrication continued with the realization of the poly-Si passivating contact on the rear. For this, first, the front side was masked with a 200 nm thick SiOx mask grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in a batch-type system. Later, the interfacial SiOx layer of the passivating contact structure was grown thermally, yielding a thickness of ~1.5 nm measured by transmission electron microscop
