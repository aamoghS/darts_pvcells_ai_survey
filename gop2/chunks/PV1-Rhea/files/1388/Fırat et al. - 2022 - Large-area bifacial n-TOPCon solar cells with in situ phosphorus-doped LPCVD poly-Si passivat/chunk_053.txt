ormed before and after the damp heat and thermal cycling tests, and in case of thermal cycling also after every 100 cycles. The evolution of Pout during the tests was assessed to determine whether the laminates of the n-TOPCon solar cells pass the damp heat and thermal cycling tests by exhibiting a Pout loss â‰¤ 5% for a single IEC61215 test. 2.3 Roadmap for Improving the n-TOPCon Solar Cells To establish a roadmap indicating experimental strategies to improve the efficiency of the n-TOPCon sola
