rease by ~1% relative upon 1000 h of damp heat testing (see Fig. 12a)) and by ~2% relative after 400 thermal cycles (see Fig. 12b)). Hence, the laminates pass the damp heat and thermal cycling tests (Pout loss â‰¤ 5% for a single IEC61215 test), showing that the screen-printed fingers of the developed solar cells do not degrade due to moisture and the interconnections between the fingers and the wires of the laminates do not fail due to thermal cycling. The results of this first assessment indic
