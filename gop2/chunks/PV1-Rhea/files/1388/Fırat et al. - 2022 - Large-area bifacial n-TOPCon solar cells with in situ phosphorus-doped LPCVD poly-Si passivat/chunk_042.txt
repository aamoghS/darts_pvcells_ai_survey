calculated [34].  �The solar cells were further inspected by optical microscopy to assess the quality of the screen-printed contacts. Moreover, the reflectance (R) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured under front illumination at a 2 cm x 2 cm spot on the solar cell in the wavelength (λ) range of 280-1200 nm using a LOANA system by PV-tools with a black chuck. For the EQE measurements, a bias light of 0.3 suns was used. The EQE data was corrected by a
