u P-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts.   Figure 13 shows that the initial simulation to match the best solar cell using the parameters in Table 1 yields η = 22.8%, along with Voc = 694.7 mV, Jsc = 40.4 mA/cm2, and FF = 81.1%. Comparison of these simulation results with the measured I-V parameters in Table 4 of the modeled best solar cell indicate 0.4% higher simulated η due to 0.7% higher simulated FF and 4.5 mV higher simulated Voc, while the simulated and the measured Jsc are perfectl
