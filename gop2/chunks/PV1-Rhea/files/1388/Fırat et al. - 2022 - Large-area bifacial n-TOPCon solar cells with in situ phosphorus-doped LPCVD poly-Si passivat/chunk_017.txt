 grown interfacial SiOx layers and applying post-LPCVD annealing, excellent passivating contacts were fabricated with J0 down to 1.5 fA/cm2 and ρc down to 1.8 mΩ∙cm2 [26]. The potential of these passivating contacts is assessed in this work at device level.  It is important to note that the use of thermal annealing, which is considered necessary for the activation of dopants and commonly applied to in situ doped Si films [2], makes the in situ doping-based approach a two-step process itself
