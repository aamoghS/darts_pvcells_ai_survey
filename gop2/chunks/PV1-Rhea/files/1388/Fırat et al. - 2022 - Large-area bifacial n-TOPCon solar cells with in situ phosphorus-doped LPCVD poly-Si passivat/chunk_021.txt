t emitter and screen-printed metallization. Impact of tpoly on the passivating contact and the solar cell properties is presented. Moreover, performance of the passivating contacts and the solar cells are reported for two types of rear surface morphologies: semi-textured and polished. The paper also reports on the suitability of the developed solar cells for application in PV modules by means of thermal cycling and damp heat tests. In addition, a roadmap is provided which shows how the efficienc
