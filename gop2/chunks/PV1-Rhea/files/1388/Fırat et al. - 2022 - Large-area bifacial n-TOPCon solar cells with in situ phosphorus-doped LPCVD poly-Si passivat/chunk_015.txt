ve a high active doping level (ND,act) in the deposited Si film, which is needed for obtaining low J0 and ρc, together with a high deposition rate (rdep) and thus throughput, as P-containing precursors slow down the Si film growth [17].  A process offering an optimized trade-off between these parameters has recently been developed by our group, which achieves the deposition of Si films, in polycrystalline form, with a high ND,act of 1.3∙1020 cm-3 and an rdep of 0.078 nm/s [26]. This represent
