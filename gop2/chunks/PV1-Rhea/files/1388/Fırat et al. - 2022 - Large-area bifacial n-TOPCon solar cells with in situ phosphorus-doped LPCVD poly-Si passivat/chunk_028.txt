at this step by varying the deposition duration, which resulted in three different tpoly values: 100 nm, 150 nm, and 200 nm. For each one of these thicknesses, a group of 8 solar cells was prepared. The tpoly values were confirmed for each split by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements on identically processed thickness monitors. As for the oxide thickness monitors, the tpoly monitors had also undergone the same annealing process as the solar cells before the thickness measurements.  A
