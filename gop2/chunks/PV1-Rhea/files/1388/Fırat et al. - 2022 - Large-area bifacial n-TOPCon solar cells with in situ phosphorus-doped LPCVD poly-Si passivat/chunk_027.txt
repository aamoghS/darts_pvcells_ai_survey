1.5 nm measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on identically oxidized thickness monitors. We would like to note that the monitors had been annealed by the same process as the solar cells prior to the TEM measurements. Following the oxidation, the in situ P-doped poly-Si film was deposited by LPCVD in a single-wafer ASM Epsilon 2000 reactor, using the process reported in [26]. The split of the tpoly screening experiment was introduced at this step by varying the deposition duration, w
