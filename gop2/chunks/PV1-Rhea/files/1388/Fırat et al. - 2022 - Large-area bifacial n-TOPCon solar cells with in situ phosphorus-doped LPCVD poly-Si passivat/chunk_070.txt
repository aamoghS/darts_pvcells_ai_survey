 82.1±0.5%, 80.2±0.6%, and 78.0±0.3%, for tpoly of 100, 150, and 200 nm, respectively. This is expected, since the parasitic absorption in the poly-Si at the illuminated side of the solar cell is known to increase with tpoly and also to be significantly greater than the absorption in a poly-Si film at the non-illuminated side for the same tpoly [40].  To understand the increasing trend of FF in Table 3 with tpoly, an FF loss analysis was performed, yielding the results in Fig. 4a). First, it
