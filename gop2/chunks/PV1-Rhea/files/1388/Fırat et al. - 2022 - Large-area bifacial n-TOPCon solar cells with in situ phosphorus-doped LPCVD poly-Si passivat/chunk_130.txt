another η gain of 0.2% is predicted when going for thinner poly-Si films with tpoly = 75 nm, which is expected to become the industry standard thickness by 2028 when new screen-printing pastes which can contact thinner poly-Si films with low J0,m are developed [1]. As explained before, reduced tpoly results in less FCA and a consequent 0.3 mA/cm2 increase in Jsc. An impressive η of 24.3% i.e., a gain of 1.5% absolute, can be achieved after these 4 steps of the roadmap, relying on industrially
