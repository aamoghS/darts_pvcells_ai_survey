 passivating contact to the front surface and thinning down the poly-Si film between the contact fingers to obtain low thicknesses and mitigate parasitic absorption losses [49,50]. For the transparent passivating contact, a J0,p,f of 5 fA/cm2 is assumed in step 8. This yields an 11 mV increase in Voc, a 0.3% improvement in FF, and a 0.5% higher η, resulting in η = 25.5%. 5 Summary and Outlook Realizing in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD offers the prospect of simplifying the manufacturing
