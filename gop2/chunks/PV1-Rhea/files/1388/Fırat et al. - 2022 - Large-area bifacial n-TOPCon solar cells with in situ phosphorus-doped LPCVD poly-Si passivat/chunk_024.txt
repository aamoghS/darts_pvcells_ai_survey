us p-type emitter with a sheet resistance of 110 Ω/□ was realized by BBr3 diffusion, followed by the removal of the borosilicate glass (BSG) in a solution containing diluted hydrofluoric acid (HF). The boron-diffused layer was later removed from the rear side by the so-called emitter removal process using a mixture of 49% HF, 70% nitric acid (HNO3), and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), with volume concentrations of 6.2%, 36.0%, and 21.4%, respectively, in the mixture diluted in water [29].
