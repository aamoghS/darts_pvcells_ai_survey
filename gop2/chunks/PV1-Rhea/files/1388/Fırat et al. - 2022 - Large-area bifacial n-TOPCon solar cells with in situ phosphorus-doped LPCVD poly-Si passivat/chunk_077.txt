r works did not identify any trend in J0,p,r as a function of tpoly [41,43]. Overall, the reduction in J0,m,r and J0,p,r with increasing tpoly indicate that the use of thicker poly-Si films lead to lower recombination losses. Both the ~1% higher FFn and FF, and the ~10 mV higher Voc for tpoly ≥ 150 nm are attributed to enhanced mitigation of recombination in case of thicker poly-Si. Another benefit of using higher tpoly is the achievement of lower ρc,r, down to 1.7 mΩ∙cm2, as Fig. 5b) show
