 cell design was optimized starting with an investigation on the impact of the poly-Si film thickness on the solar cell performance. This study revealed the necessity of using a tpoly ≥ 150 nm to properly passivate the areas metallized by screen-printing, allowing J0,m,r < 100 fA/cm2. While such thicker layers were found to yield slightly lower J0,p,r and ρc,r as well, they were also responsible for increased FCA, reducing the Jsc of the solar cells by ~0.15 mA/cm2 per 50 nm increase in tpoly
