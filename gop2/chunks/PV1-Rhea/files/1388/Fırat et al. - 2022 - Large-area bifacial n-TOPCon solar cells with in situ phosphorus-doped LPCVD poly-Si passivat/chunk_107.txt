FF, resistive losses remain dominant and the discussions in previous sections regarding the FF loss analyses are valid. Third, DARC yields an average increase in η by 0.2%, which is due to a significant improvement in Jsc by 0.5 mA/cm2. The resulting average Jsc of 40.8 mA/cm2 matches the Jsc obtained in the litera
