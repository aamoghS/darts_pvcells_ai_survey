passivating contacts fabricated by the standard industrial approach based on LPCVD and ex situ P doping has been the focus of a plethora of studies [2,5,10,11]. As a result, the impact of various n-TOPCon solar cell design parameters on the ex situ doped passivating contact and device properties has already been investigated. The studied parameters include the method used for growing the interfacial SiOx film [12], the structural properties of the poly-Si film [13], the poly-Si film thickness (t
