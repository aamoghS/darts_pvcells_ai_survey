 cells by ~0.15 mA/cm2 per 50 nm increase in tpoly. As a result of this trade-off between the electrical and optical properties of the devices, the average η saturated just below 22% for tpoly ≥ 150 nm, when a semi-textured rear surface morphology was used. A tpoly of 150 nm was therefore chosen for further development.  Further improvement of the solar cell design was achieved by realizing a flatter, polished rear surface for the devices, resulting in an average η of 22.4%. This was found t
