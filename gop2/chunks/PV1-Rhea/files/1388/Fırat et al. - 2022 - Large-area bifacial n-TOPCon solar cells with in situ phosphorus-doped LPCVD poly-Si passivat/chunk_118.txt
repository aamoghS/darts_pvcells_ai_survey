re not optimized for maximizing the Î·. Among the other I-V parameters, the Voc does not change significantly upon lamination, remaining at ~690 mV, while the Jsc drops by ~1.6 mA/cm2, to ~38.7 mA/cm2, because of the optical losses at laminate level, mainly due to the use of glass without ARC for the preparation of the laminates. Moreover, the FF drops by ~4.5% absolute, to 75.5-75.9%, which is attributed to the series resistance contribution of the interconnections, raising the rs of the lamina
