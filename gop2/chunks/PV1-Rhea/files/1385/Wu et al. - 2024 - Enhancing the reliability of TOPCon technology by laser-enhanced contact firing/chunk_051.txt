 main cause for its low corrosion resistance, and thus, reducing or removing Al from the paste results in TOPCon solar cells with a high corrosion resistance. 3.5.Module results To further substantiate the stability of JSIM TOPCon solar cells, we fabricated commercial-sized G-B modules comprising 144 half-cut cells and subjected them to standard module-level DH85 testing and compared the results to modules made using baseline solar cells. Throughout the testing phase, electroluminescence imaging
