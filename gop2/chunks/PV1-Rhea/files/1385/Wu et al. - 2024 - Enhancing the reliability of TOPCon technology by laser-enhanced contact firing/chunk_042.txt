ongside capturing SEM images, we utilized EDS for elemental analysis of the metal contacts. Fig. 7 (a) and (c) depict metal contacts predominantly composed of Ag which is as expected. The baseline samples clearly show the presence of Al in the contact, while no Al was detected in the JSIM metal contacts in this work. Notably, the edges of the Al-rich regions exhibited an overlay of O, indicating that the Al in the contact was partially oxidized. Additionally, no Na or Cl was detected in the EDS
