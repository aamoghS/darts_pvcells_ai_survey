lity conferred by laser-assisted firing customized paste were revealed through detailed analysis of the contacts by scanning electron microscopy after accelerated testing. Additionally, glass-backsheet (G-B) modules were fabricated to conduct further long- term reliability testing of both baseline and laser-assisted firing-treated TOPCon solar cells. 2.Experimental details All the TOPCon cells were processed on G10 n-type Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafers (182 mm Ã—182 mm).
