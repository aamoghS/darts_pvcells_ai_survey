ocess. The laser-treated group utilized Jolywood Special Injected Metallization (JSIM) in conjunction with customized Ag paste for the front contact formation on TOPCon solar cells. This involved a lower-temperature firing process to facilitate paste penetration through the front anti-reflection coating, culminating in the establishment of metal-semiconductor ohmic contact through whole-surface laser line scanning under reverse bias conditions. The laser operated at a wavelength of 1030 nm with
