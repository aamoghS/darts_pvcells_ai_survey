 wafers (182 mm Ã—182 mm). Fig. 1 (a) illustrates the structure of the TOPCon cell with selective emitters, while both experimental and control groups utilized TOPCon precursors where the TOPCon contact was made using plasma oxidation & plasma-assisted in situ-doping deposition (POPAID), a physical vapor deposition technique developed by Jolywood. The primary difference between the laser-treated and baseline samples was the front metallization process. The laser-treated group utilized Jolywood S
