short-circuit current (I
sc
) was ~1.2%
rel 
for JSIM modules and ~2.2%
rel 
for baseline modules, while both exhibited a ~0.2%
rel 
loss in V
oc
. The cause for the drop in I
sc 
is likely related to changes in the optics of the module which are not related to the solar cells and thus were omitted from the further dis
-
cussion. The minimal loss in V
oc 
is consistent with the results presented in Sections 3.1 to 3.3, which indicated that corrosion predominantly affects the series resistance of
