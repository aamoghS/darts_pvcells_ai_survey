nt and associated pastes on the long-term stability of TOPCon solar cells and modules, particularly under damp-heat conditions is imperative. In this study, we employed contaminant-induced accelerated DH85 testing to assess industrial TOPCon solar cells using an optimized paste combined with the laser-assisted firing process, contrasting them with baseline TOPCon solar cells all fabricated at an industrial production line. The advantages of stability conferred by laser-assisted firing customized
