ability issues faced by TOPCon solar cells and modules under operational conditions, particularly under high humidity and temperature [14,15,20,21]. Damp-heat stress, exemplified by conditions such as the standard DH85 test (85

C, 85% relative humidity), has been linked to substantial degradation in power output [18,22,23]. Investigations by Sommeling et al. and Iqbal et al. underscore the sensitivity of TOPCon cell front-side contacts to damp-heat conditions, culminating in severe contact
