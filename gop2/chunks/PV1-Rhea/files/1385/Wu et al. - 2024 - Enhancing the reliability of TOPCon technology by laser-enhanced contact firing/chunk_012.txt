ty of the TOPCon solar cells to allow for the use of cheaper module bill of materials. In recent years, laser-assisted firing has garnered substantial interest as an improved firing technique for silicon solar cells [28â€“34]. Among these approaches, laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO), which was initially introduced by Mayberry et al. entails applying a highly intense laser pulse locally on the front side of the solar cell under a constant reverse voltage [34]. This leads to a high local
