Additionally, no Na or Cl was detected in the EDS analysis of control samples. Fig. 7 (b) shows the Baseline-NaCl sample after 20 h of DH85 which looks substantially different from the Baseline-control sample. The Baseline-control samples kept the Al round particle state after DH85 testing, but, for Baseline NaCl, the internal distribution of Al was no longer concentrated but dispersed within the contact. Additionally, traces of O and Cl overlapped with Al, suggesting that the Al was corroded an
