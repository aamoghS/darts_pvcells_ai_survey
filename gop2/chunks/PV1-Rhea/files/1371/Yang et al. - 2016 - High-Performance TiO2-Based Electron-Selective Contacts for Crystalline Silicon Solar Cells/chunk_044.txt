  ﬁ lm due to the phase transformation from amorphous to the anatase. Yu et al. reported that an amor-
phous TiO 2  layer with high tensile stress forms at the begin-ning of the deposition, which induces the nucleation of anatase 
phase as the thickness of TiO 2  ﬁ lms increases. [ 25 ]  This indicates that the thicker the TiO 2  ﬁ lm, the lower temperature needed for the phase transformation from amorphous to the anatase. The 
surface passivation of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks degrades at a high
