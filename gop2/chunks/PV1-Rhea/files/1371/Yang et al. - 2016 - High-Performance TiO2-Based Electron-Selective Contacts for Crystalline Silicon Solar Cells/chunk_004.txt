a-Si:H/doped a-Si:H CSC. [ 2–4 ]  Recently, silicon solar cells fea-turing a tunnel SiO 2 /doped poly-Si CSC ( TOPCon ) at the rear have been achieved a remarkably high efﬁ ciency of 25.1%. [ 8 ]  Therefore, silicon solar cells based on CSCs have the potential 
to achieve ultrahigh efﬁ ciencies in the not so distant future.  Although a-Si:H and SiO 2 -based CSCs have achieved great success in the development of high-efﬁ ciency silicon solar cells, there are some intrinsic challenges such
