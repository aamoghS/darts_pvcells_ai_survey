 versus top circle contact diameter.   Figure    3  a shows the dependence of  ρ  c  of n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions on TiO 2  ﬁ lm thickness before and after FGA annealing. The  ρ  c  between n-Si and Al without TiO 2  interlayer was measured by a transmission line method (TLM), [ 27 ]  and  ρ  c  was extracted approximately from an extrap-olation of resistance versus pad spacing. A relatively large  ρ  c  between 0.5 and 1.0 Ω cm 2  is obtained for the n-Si/Al con
