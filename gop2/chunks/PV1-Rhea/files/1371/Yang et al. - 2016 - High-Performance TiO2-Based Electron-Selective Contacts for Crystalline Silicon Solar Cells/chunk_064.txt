of oxygen in the TiO 2  interlayer can destroy the Si–O–Ti bonding at the Si/TiO 2  interface, resulting in a higher surface recombination, and hence a lower  V  oc . Fortunately, the reac-tion between TiO 2  and Al has only a slight effect on the surface passivation quality of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack on silicon surface, but it signiﬁ cantly decreases the contact resistivity at the Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunction. A relatively high  V  oc  of 676 mV and FF of 80.7% have been achieved with a fu
