icated with locally doped 
or/and contact regions at front or rear sides. [ 1 ]  However, the approach used to realize localized contact and/or doped regions 
for PERL and PERT cells requires cost-intensive processes, such 
as high temperature diffusion followed by complex patterning 
processes (e.g., photolithography, inkjet mask formation, laser 
processes), which have limited the commercial success of these 
high-efÔ¨Å ciency cell concepts.  An alternative approach to achieve high PCE silicon
