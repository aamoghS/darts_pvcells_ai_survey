the stable passivation at the rear side during ﬁ nal FGA annealing at 350 °C.  The different passivation quality changes of TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks under FGA annealing might be attributed to the different passivation mechanisms. Instead of passivating 
silicon surface by forming the Si–O–Ti bonding for sole TiO 2  ﬁ lm, the passivation of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks to silicon surfaces is considered to be achieved by a combination of chemical passiva-
tion of SiO 2  and ﬁ eld-effect
