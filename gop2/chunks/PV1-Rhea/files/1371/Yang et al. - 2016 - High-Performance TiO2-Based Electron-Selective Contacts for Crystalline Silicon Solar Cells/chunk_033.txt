 [ 24 ]  There-fore, silicon solar cells with a full-area TiO 2  contact show an improved  V  oc  due to the reduced surface recombination at the Si/TiO 2  interface.   Although ultrathin TiO 2  can provide excellent passivation on silicon surfaces, the passivation thermal stability is only stable 
at the temperature of up to 250 °C. The surface passivation Adv. Mater. 2016, 28, 5891–5897www.advmat.dewww.MaterialsViews.com
