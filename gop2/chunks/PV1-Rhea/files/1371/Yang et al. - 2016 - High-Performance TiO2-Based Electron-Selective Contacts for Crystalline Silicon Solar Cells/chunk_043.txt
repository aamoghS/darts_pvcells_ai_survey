icker TiO 2  capping (4.5 nm). FGA annealing can improve the chemical passivation of SiO 2  by the diffusion of atomic hydrogen to the SiO 2 /Si interface where it deacti-vates recombination centers. Therefore, the surface passivation improvement of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks by FGA annealing can be attributed to the improved chemical passivation of SiO 2 . How-ever, FGA annealing at high temperature will degrade the ﬁ eld-effect passivation of TiO 2  ﬁ lm due to the phase transformation from amor
