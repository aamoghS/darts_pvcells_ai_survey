 lms deposition. The oxidation was performed in a preheated quartz tube furnace at 700 Â°C for only 150 s in O 2  atmosphere, resulting in a tunnel SiO 2  thickness of â‰ˆ1.2 nm. The passivation quality of the TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  layers was quantiï¬ ed in terms of the effective lifetime (Ï„ eff ) and effective surface recombination velocity ( S  eff ), which is calculated from  Ï„  eff  by the expression: [ 21 ]
