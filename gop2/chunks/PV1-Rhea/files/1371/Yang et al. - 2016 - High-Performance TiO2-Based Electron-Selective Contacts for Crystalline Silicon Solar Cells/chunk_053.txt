i/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions, which is almost one order of magnitude lower than that before FGA. A 
minimum  ρ  c  of ≈0.02 Ω cm 2  is achieved at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions with a 2.5 nm TiO 2  ﬁ lm, which is comparable to the  ρ  c  obtained on a high quality n-Si/SiO 2 /phosphorus doped poly-Si heterojunctions. [ 31 ]  The reduced  ρ  c  at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions after FGA annealing might be caused by the composition chan
