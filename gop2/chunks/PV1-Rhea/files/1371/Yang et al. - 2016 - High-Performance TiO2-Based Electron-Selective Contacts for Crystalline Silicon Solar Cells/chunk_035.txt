COMMUNICATIONperformance degrades rapidly at a temperature higher than 250 °C (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It might be caused by the phase transformation from amorphous to anatase of the 
TiO 2  ﬁ lm at a temperature of ≥300 °C. Liao et al. reported that anatase phase was observed in TiO 2  ﬁ lm deposited at 300 °C by ALD. [ 24 ]  It is well known that amorphous TiO 2  ﬁ lms (as-deposited) are preferred for c-Si surface passivation, as they 
may introduce fewer interface defec
