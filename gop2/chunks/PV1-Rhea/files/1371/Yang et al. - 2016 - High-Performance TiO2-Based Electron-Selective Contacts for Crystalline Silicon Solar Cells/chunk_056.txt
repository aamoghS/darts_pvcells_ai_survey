under bright-ﬁ eld (BF) and high reso-lution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) conditions 
and elemental maps were obtained by energy-ﬁ ltered TEM (EFTEM), as shown in Figure  3 e,f. In both contact structures, 
an obvious aluminum oxide (AlO  x  ) with a thickness of 2–3 nm is observed between TiO 2  and Al interface. However, a very thin and non-obvious AlO  x   interlayer (≈0.5 nm) was observed in the TiO 2 /Al interface before FGA annealing (see Figure S4, Sup-porting Informat
