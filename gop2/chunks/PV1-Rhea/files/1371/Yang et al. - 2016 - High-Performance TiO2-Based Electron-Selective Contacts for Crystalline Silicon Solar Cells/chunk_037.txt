 in a lower  V  oc  (638 mV) than expected.  Inspired by the excellent surface passivation and thermal stability of SiO 2 /doped poly-Si CSC, [ 5–8 ]  a thermally grown tunnel SiO 2  (≈1.2 nm) is inserted between Si and TiO 2  ﬁ lm to improve the passivation thermal stability of TiO 2  ﬁ lm on silicon surfaces. The passivation quality of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks with different thickness of TiO 2  capping on n-type silicon surfaces (1.0 Ω cm) is also investigated by quasi-steady state photo
