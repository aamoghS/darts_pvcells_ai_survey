he cell is demonstrated in Fig. 1. It constructs with boron emitter on front side and passivating connecting layer on back side, along with fingers on both sides pasted by screen-printed system to develop bi-facial solar cell. Low amounts of oxygen required for phosphorus doped wafers, �with a resistivity level of around 0.5 Ωcm to 1 Ωcm. The sequence of cell construction is shown in Fig. 2. In a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution the wafers are textured on both sides �with irregular pyram
