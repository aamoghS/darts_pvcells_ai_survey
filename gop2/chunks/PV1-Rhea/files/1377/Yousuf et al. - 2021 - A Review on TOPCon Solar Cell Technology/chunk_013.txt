re. The challenge is to secure the thin tunnel-oxide/ �poly-Si layer from the annihilation of the firing-through paste at the elevated temperature. Firing from paste removes the �polysilicon thin layer and introduces Ag nanoparticles into �crystalline silicon that further enhance the saturation current Jo of the passivating contact region13). The saturation current density of the metal contacts was investigated about 35 fA/cm2.14) Polysilicon films with a thickness of more than 150 nm can
