cell has a boron diffused front emitter, a tunnel-SiOx/n+- poly-Si/ SiNx:H structure at the rear side, and screen-printed electrodes on both sides. The saturation currents Jo of this structure on polished surface is 1.3 fA/cm2 and for textured silicon surfaces is 3.7 fA/cm2 before printing the silver contacts. After printing the Ag contacts, the Jo of this structure increases to 50.7 fA/cm2 on textured silicon surfaces, which is still manageably less for metal contacts.This structure was applied
