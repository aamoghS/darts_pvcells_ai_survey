are textured on both sides �with irregular pyramids. After RCA cleaning, using a boron �tribromide (BBr3) solution the boron emitter is created in a boron diffusion furnace. By a single side etching process using hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid (HF/HNO3) solution, the rear boron diffusion is removed. After cleaning with chemicals, a tunneling SiOx is thermally developed and a pure poly silicon layer (minimum partially poly-crystalline) is accumulated in a �LPCVD system. The pure poly-sil
