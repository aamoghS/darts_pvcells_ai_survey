e quality of passivation of the tunnel oxide layer clearly depends on the bond of SiO in the tunnel oxide layer, which is affected by the subsequent annealing and the tunnel oxide layer was formed in the suboxide region (SiO, Si2O, Si2O3) at the interface with the substrate.In the suboxide region, an oxygen-rich bond is formed as a result of subsequent annealing that also improves the quality of passivation.To control the surface morphology, annealing profile, and acceleration rate, an oxide tun
