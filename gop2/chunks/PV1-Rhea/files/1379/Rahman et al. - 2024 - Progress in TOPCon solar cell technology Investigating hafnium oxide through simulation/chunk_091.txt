tion activities, which potentially heightens the open- circuit voltage (Voc). Furthermore, the broader bandgap of HfO2 may enhance the cellâ€™s optical performance by decreasing parasitic light absorption, offering a path to a greater short-circuit current density (Jsc). These improvements could synergistically elevate the overall ef
