dex spans approximately 1.44–1.46 for visible light wavelengths (around 550 nm), contingent on factors like preparation method, purity, and temperature. Amorphous SiO2, prevalent in thin film coatings and integrated circuits, leans toward the lower end of this range, while crystalline forms, like quartz, exhibit slightly higher refractive indices. SiO2’s refractive index diminishes with increasing light wavelengths. Hafnium oxide, or HfO2, boasts notable optical traits prized for its high di
