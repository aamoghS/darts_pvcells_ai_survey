ditions, with the area under each curve representing the power output. The HfO2 layer exhibits a slightly higher Jsc and efficiency, suggesting improved performance over the SiO2 layer in this simulation. HfO2â€™s advantageous attributes for passivation in TOPCon solar cells are increasingly recognized. Its elevated dielectric constant amplifies the internal electric field, fostering superior carrier separation and dimin
