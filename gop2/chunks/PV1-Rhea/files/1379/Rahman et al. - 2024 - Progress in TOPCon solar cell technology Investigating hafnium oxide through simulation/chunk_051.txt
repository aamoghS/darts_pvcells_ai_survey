ight absorption and electrical performance [15]. These values crucially shape the design and engineering of optical devices, coatings, and semiconductor technologies, influencing lightâ€™s behavior within these materials and informing their applications. ATLAS Silvaco simulation software helps predict how the inclusion of HfO2 layers can improve charge carrier lifetime by 21.3%, which could lead to a substantial in
