gy, p-type doping continues to play a pivotal role, underscored by its cost-effectiveness and the maturity of manufacturing techniques. Despite the burgeoning interest in n-type materials, attributed to their superior efficiency and reduced degradation phenomena, p-type silicon retains its relevance within the industry. This persistence is largely due to optimized production processes and substantial infrastructural in
