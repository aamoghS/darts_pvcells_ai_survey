ciency. The process is initiated by defining the solar cell structure, specifying the silicon substrate, emitter layers, metal contacts, and pivotal passivation layers (SiO2 and HfO2) 
Fig. 2.The figure showcases the energy band structures in TOPCon solar cells with n-type and p-type doping. In the left panel (a), the n-type configuration is presented, highlighted by the presence of electrons as majority charge carriers, while the right panel (b) displays the p-type setup, where holes predominat
