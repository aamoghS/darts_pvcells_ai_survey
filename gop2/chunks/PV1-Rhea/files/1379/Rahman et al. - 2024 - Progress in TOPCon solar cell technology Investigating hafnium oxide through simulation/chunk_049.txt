tive index values are approximate and can fluctuate based on material composition, structure, and measurement conditions [35]. Accurate refractive index measurements often demand sophisticated techniques such as ellipsometry, spectroscopic methods, or interferometry [14]. The figure suggests that the refractive index of HfOâ‚‚ decreases with increasing wavelength, a relati
