, beyond its role as a comparative material, might not be explicitly detailed in the provided sections. The comparison to SiO2 serves as a baseline to emphasize the improvements and potential benefits offered by HfO2, such as enhanced passivation capabilities and operational stability, which are critical for advancing solar cell technologies and achieving higher efficiencies. The term “optimizing HfO2 properties” denotes the process of methodically adjusting the physical and chemical charact
