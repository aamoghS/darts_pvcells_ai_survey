both front and rear sides to curtail recombination losses of charge carriers and minimize energy losses. Hafnium oxide (HfO2) is increasingly favoured in TOPCon solar cells due to its advantageous material properties. With a higher dielectric constant than silicon oxide (SiO2), HfO2 enhances passivation and fosters efficient charge carrier separation, essential for minimizing recombination losses [2]. Additionally, HfO2’s robustness at elevated temperatures bolsters the cells’ endurance and
