eparation and cell efficiency. The simulations are based on the comparison of TOPCon solar cells with SiO2 and HfO2 passivation layers, analyzing various efficiencies, carrier lifetimes, and surface recombination rates. For SiO2, the refractive index decreases slightly as the wavelength increases, indicating a typical dispersion relationship where the material is less optically dense at higher wavelengths. In comparison, HfO2 shows a more pronounced decrease in refractive index with increasing w
