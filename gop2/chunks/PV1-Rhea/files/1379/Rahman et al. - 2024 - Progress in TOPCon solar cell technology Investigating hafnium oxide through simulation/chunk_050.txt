₂ decreases with increasing wavelength, a relationship that’s valuable for understanding and optimizing the material’s behavior in photovoltaic applications. The refractive index of HfO₂ and SiO2 with a thickness of 1.2 nm across various wavelengths by using the Simulation tool. At this nano- scale thickness, HfO₂’s optical properties, such as its refractive index, are critical for its function in solar cells, where it can influence light absorption and electrical performance [15].
