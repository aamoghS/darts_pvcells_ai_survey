ated Contact) solar cells with SiO2 (Silicon Dioxide) and HfO2 (Hafnium oxide) passivation layers is crucial for visualizing energy levels and their alignment at critical interfaces in the structure [26]. In the SiO2-based TOPCon energy band diagram, SiO2 acts as the passivation layer on the silicon subs
