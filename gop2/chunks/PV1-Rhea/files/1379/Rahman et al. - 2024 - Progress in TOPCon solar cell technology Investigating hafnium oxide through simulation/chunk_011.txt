rough meticulous simulation, it has been established that the strategic incorporation of HfO2 can lead to a 21.3% increase in charge carrier lifetime, with the possibility of boosting the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) by up to 25%. This discovery significantly delineates our work from foun
