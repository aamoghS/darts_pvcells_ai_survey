rsion efficiency by up to 25%. The research suggests that HfO2 enhances the passivation of the silicon surface, which is crucial for efficient charge carrier separation, a key factor in reducing recombination losses. Furthermore, the study outlines the potential superiority of HfO2 in reducing surface recombination, which is backed by simulations that project HfO2’s beneficial impact on the solar cell’s electric field, thus affecting charge separation and cell efficiency. The simulations are
