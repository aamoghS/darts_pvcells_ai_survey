s play a pivotal role in understanding how these layers influence the overall efficiency and functionality of the solar cell. 3.3.Simulation of SiO2 passivated TOPCon solar cell In the simulation of a TOPCon solar cell with a SiO2 passivation layer, various parameters are considered. The SiO2 layer’s thickness, refractive index, and electrical properties are modeled to determine their impact on the cell’s performance. The simulation involves modeling the band structure, carrier transport, re
