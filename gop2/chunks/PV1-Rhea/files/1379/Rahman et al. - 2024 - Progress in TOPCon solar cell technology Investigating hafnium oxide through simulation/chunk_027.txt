 ATLAS Silvaco simulation software to underscore the enhanced performance attributes of HfO2 over SiO2, particularly noting a substantial improvement in charge carrier lifetime and overall power conversion efficiency attributed to the optimization of HfO2 layers. The simulations predict a notable 21.3% increase in charge carrier lifetime and a potential boost in power conversion efficiency of up to 25% using HfO2, setting this work apart from existing literature by highlighting the precision of
