counting for carrier transport, recombination mechanisms, and light transmission, aiding in optimizing light trapping efficiency and photon-to-electron conversion [17]. ATLAS Silvaco facilitates the simulation of carrier transport and recombination mechanisms, which is essential for understanding how passivation layers affect carrier dyna
