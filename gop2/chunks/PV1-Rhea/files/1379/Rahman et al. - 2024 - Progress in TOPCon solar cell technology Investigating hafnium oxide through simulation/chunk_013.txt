 capability to enhance the interface quality with silicon, which in turn could substantially augment the performance and longevity of TOPCon solar cells. The novelty of this research lies in its predictive analysis, achieved through comprehensive simulations, which project HfO2’s impactful role in improving TOPCon solar cell efficiency. This approach not only leverages the existing literature on HfO2’s material advantages but also builds upon previous experimental findings to offer a forward
