ciency [38,39]. Simulating Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells with different passivation layers, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) and hafnium oxide (HfO2), involves intricate computational models to predict and analyze the cellâ€™s behavior and performance [20]. These simulations play a pivotal role in understanding how these l
