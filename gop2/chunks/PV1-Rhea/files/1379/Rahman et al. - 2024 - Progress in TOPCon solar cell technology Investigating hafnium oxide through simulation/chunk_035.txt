 [6]. Subsequent stages witnessed the emergence of initial prototypes featuring rear-side passivated contacts, optimizing the cellâ€™s structure to reduce surface recombination and bolster overall efficiency. Advancements focused on refining design and manufacturing processes, emphasizing passivation layer optimization, surface passivation quality enhancement, and improved carrier transport for heightened efficiency [7]. Transitioning from laboratory-scale development to industrial production be
