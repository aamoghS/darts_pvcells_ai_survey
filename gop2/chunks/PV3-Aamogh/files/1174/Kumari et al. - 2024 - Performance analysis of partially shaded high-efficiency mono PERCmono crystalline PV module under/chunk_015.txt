en circuit conditions associated with a solar cell are dened as the load resistance equal to zero or innitely large, respectively. ce current and voltage values at short-circuit and open-circuit conditions are called short-circuit current ( 
Isc
 ) and open-circuit voltage ( 
Voc
 ), respectively. cere is one specic point where the amps ( 
Imp)
 times volts ( 
Vmp)
 generate the greatest wattage. is point on the IÂ–V characteristic curve of an illuminated solar cell is called the maximum pow
