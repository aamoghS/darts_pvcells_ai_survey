perature to increase and consequently leading to hotspot. A bypass diode is therefore needed to prevent irreversible damage to the shaded solar module. e most frequent causes of shadowing a PV module are vegetation, buildings, the build-up of dust and soil, and animal and bird waste. A shading defect caused by any of these reasons leads to a drop in generated output power. Entire PV panels in the (2)
