from that in an indoor setting. is dierence is because the ambient temperature and irradiations are constant in indoor setups, while in outdoor setups, the PV module experiences a variable ambient temperature and solar radiation. Hence, the generated output is the combined eect of the persistent environmental conditions.e current
