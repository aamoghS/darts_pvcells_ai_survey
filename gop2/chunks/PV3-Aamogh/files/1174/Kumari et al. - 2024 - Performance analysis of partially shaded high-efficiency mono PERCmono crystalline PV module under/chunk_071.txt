ed in two steps. e STC conditions are character-ized by 1000 W/m2 of solar irradiance with cell temperature of 25Â°C. I. Primarily, the experiment is conducted under no shading conditions. e electrical parameters and characteristics are recorded. is is done to verify that the module is in healthy condition and does not pursue an initial defect. II. Secondarily, the shading is applied from the bottom to the top of the module. e shading starts by cov-ering 20% of the cell area, then 40%, 60%,
