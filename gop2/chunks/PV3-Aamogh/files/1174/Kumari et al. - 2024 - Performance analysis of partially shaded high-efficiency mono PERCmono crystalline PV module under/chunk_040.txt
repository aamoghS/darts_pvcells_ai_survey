on, and it may even induce re in severe  cases32. A research article reported that partial shading is more dangerous than full-cell shading. e paper proposed a new approach to identify the shading in a PV module and, hence, knowing the stage where the cell is destroyed permanently due to localized  heating19. In their article, the author showed the numerous ways to recognize the impact of shading and hotspots. ey also demonstrated the impact of non-uniformity of solar radiation using infrared
