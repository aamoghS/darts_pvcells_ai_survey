rtially shaded cell. For conventional monocrystalline silicon cell avalanche breakdown is one of the crucial mechanism responsible for junction and this occurs at the weakest location in the cell area. e leakage current distribution might not be uniform under reverse bias condition, and one of them could lead to hotspot. Hence it a material property and the distribution of leakage current distribu-tion that would dene the rise of  temperature66. Bressan etal. similar to this paper work explai
