ading and associated hotpot degradation within PV modules has become an important area of research and development. The experimental approach of this paper aims to investigate single cell shading in high efficiency monocrystalline silicon PV PERC modules. Prior to the outdoor experiment, the PV module underwent experimental testing under STC to determine variation in electrical and thermal behaviour due to partial shading. The indoor experiments are performed using Sun‑simulator and the I–V
