 current is also noted in the conducted experimental test by authors in their research  work58. However, while covering the entire PV cell by implementing 100% shading, the value of 
Isc
 drops to its lowest value. cese types of results are also evidently presented in the research article generated  by59. Authors in their study concluded degradation in the 
Isc
 as one main reason for power  degradation60. Signicant changes in 
Isc
 impact the maximum generated power
