sen commercial monocrystalline PERC PV Module under the North Indian Climatic conditions of Rajasthan. In contrast to laboratory testing, the outdoor conditions are realistic and hence unpredictable. To understand the dierence in the performance the shading experimental work is done in STC conditions under controlled conditions. For indoor setup the maximum power loss is of 36.34%, however for outdoor conditions the power loss of 42% is recorded. e outdoor study denes the critical shading sce
