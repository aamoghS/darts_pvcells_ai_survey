 by authors Ghosh etal. where the circuit named as HSMC- Hotspot Mitigation Circuit is capable of reducing elevated cell temperature by 10Â°C under mismatch conditions by modied bypass  techniques38. Such a technique could be very benecial for large scale PV systems potentially reducing mitigation process. Recent literature presented an article on optimization technique called as a black widow reconguration which proposed to boost power output and better functioning scenario in partial shad
