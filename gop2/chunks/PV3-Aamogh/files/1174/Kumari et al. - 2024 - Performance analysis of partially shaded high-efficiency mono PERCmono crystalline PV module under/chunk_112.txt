l with a maximum eciency (%) of 16.25. e temperature of the cell to be tested for shading is of the same temperature as that of the PV module. e maximum eciency during the 20% shading is generated at 11:30:00 with a solar irradiance of 960 W/m2. Likewise, maximum eciency during 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% shading is attained at 970 W/m2, 990 W/m2, 950 W/m2, and 940 W/m2, respectively. Table4 give the values of the Maximum hotspot temperature, Maximum eciency, maximum ambient tempera-ture, max
