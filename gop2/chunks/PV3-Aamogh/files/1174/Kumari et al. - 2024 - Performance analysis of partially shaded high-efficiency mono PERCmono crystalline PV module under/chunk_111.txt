y increases. However, an increase in ambient temperature along with solar radiation causes module eciency to drop. It is observed that under the hot and dry outdoor conditions, the maximum drop in the eciency during the experiments is recorded mainly around noon till 13:30:30, when solar radiation is not varying much and the average ambient temperature is at its peak. It is observed that when the PV module is not shaded, the module performs well with a maximum eciency (%) of 16.25. e tempera
