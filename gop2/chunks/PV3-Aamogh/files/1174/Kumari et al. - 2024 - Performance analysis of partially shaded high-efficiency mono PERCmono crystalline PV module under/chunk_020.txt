ratory or the research is been conducted on a commercial large scale PV system. As mentioned in the  report8 with almost 60% market share, PERC design is consolidating its supremacy in commercial eld. Hence it calls attention to research the impact of dynamic environment on thermal and electrical behaviour of commercial designs high eAciency PERC PV modules due to single cell shading. e study targets to nds out the critical shading area for a single cell in case of commercial PERC modules tha
