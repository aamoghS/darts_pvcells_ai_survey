ted on a single PV, will cause maximum damage to the PV cell. Under this condition, a hotspot may develop in the shaded cell with an expected hike in temperature. is could be explained as the photocurrent declines due to shading, the cell that is shaded undergoes reverse bias causing dierence in operating points of shaded and other series connected cell. is reverse characteristic of shaded cell is accountable for reverse bias process of the partially shaded cell. For conventional monocrystall
