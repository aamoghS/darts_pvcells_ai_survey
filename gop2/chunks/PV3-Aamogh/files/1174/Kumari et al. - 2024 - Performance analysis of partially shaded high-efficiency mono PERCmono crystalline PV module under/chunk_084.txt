 perfect shape and no deviations from standard shapes. e recorded values of short circuit current is 9.81 A, open circuit voltage is 48V, and maximum output power is 364.822W. e other performance parameters, which are eciency and ll factor, are available in Table2.Electrical characteristics at standard test conditions with shadingPV modules with shading defects can be easily traced with IV and PV curve characterization. Numerous studies have demonstrated the occurrence of multiple ste
