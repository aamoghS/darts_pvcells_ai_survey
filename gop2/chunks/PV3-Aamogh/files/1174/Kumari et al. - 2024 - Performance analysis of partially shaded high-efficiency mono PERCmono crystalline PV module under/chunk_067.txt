 in the external environments due to varying ambient conditions. To understand the partial shading and hotspot development further, an outdoor experimental study is performed. e module is tested to analyse the electrical and thermal response due to single cell shading. All the variables such as solar irradiation, daily ambient temperature, wind and humidity are recorded continuously and saved with the automatic data loggers available at the outdoor setup. At present this is the best methodology
