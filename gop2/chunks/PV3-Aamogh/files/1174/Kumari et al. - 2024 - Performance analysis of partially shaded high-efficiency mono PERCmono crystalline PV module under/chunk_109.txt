future research.Figure11 shows the value of maximum eciency and value of maximum hotspot temperature under particular shading percentage. e temperature of the shaded cell increases till the cell area is shaded 60% of the cell. Beyond that, the temperature of the shaded cell drops. Figure12 clearly compares the recorded eciencies of the PV module for the entire day under respective shading proles. e resultant eciency of the module was obtained with a combined impact of variable solar irra
