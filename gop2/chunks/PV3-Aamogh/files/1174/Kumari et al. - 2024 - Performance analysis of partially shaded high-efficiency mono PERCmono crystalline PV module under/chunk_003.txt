oor experiments recorded hotspot temperature of 85–90.1 °C under respective 40% and 60% critical shading scenarios. The efficiency recorded in the time interval of 11:00:00 and 11:30:00 was highest for the solar radiations between 940 and 990 W/m2. The maximum drop in efficiency is recorded from noon till 13:30:00 time of the day. Development of hotspot is directly related to the failure or malfunction of protecting system. Hence the importance of type of PV technology, amount of shading, and
