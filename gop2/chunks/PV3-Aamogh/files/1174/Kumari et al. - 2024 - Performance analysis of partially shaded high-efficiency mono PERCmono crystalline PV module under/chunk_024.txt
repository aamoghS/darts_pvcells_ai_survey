 PV systems. A PV systemÂ’s performance is directly aected by shading. Shading can be in any formÂ—complete shadow or partial shadow. e shaded portion of the illuminated PV module acts as load resistance and starts to consume the electrical power. In such conditions, the unshaded parts of the PV module compel the shaded part to go in reverse bias condition. Under reverse bias conditions, the shaded portion dis-sipates power, causing surface temperature to increase and consequently leading to h
