rature elevation nearly disappeared. As observed from the experiment, the rise in temperature of the shaded cell has the potential to develop hotspots further when exposed to elded conditions. It is essential to consider that elevated temperatures depend on the leakage current, and power is dissipated in some regions of the cell. During indoor testing, the shaded cell recorded a high temperature of 30.6Â°C, while the other unshaded cell did not exhibit a signicant increase in temperature. e
