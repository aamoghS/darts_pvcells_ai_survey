o dierent scenarios: uniformly illuminated PV module and partially illuminated PV module. e degradation caused by shading is meticulously presented in a research paper by M. C. Garc√≠a etal. e work done in their research demonstrated the diode characteristics under shaded conditions, where a PV cell tends to function in the 3rd quadrant, indicating the power output response of a shaded  module11. Another research work demonstrated that the partial shade hinders the PV performance and damages
