l topology incorporating BJT with two MOSFETs instead of using a bypass diode to maintain the voltage positive across the shaded cell. is advancement could successfully lower the power loss due to shading. However, the model complexity and overall system cost  increased20. e shading can cause the variation in the temperature at cell and module level. e result of a research study demonstrated temperature surges and decrease in output voltage under various shadow  situations21.
