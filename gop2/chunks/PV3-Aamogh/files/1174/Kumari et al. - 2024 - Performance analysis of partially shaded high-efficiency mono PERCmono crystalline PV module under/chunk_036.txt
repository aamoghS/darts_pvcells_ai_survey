ower output prediction in partially shaded BIPV is presented by L. Zhu etal. where the author proposed a thoughtful approach that correlated the solar cell shaded area proportion (%) with photocurrent and series resistor. Based on this analysis, a simplied mathematical model is presented to predict the various parameter under the partial shading conditions. Secondly, they demonstrated relationship between shaded area proportion (%) with IV and PV results of PV Module and nally descried th
