roduce power over their operational lifetime. Dierent PV technologies tested inside a laboratory may behave when installed in outdoor conditions. is study aims to analyse how a commercial PV module behaves when placed in outdoor conditions. Partial or full shading of PV systems is a widespread phenomenon. However, shading could generate non-linearities in electrical characteristics of PV systems. e initial investigation of the PV module is done in the laboratory under STC conditions. Under st
