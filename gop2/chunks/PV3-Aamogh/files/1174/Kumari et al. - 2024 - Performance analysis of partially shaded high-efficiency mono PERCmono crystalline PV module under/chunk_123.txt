. e outdoor study denes the critical shading scenario that could lead to temperature rise of about 91.1Â°C in the shaded cell. Also, it shows that PV parameter show dependency on varying outdoor conditions. It is observed that in commercial PERC module the critical shading scenario ranges from 40 to 60% of the solar cell that causes hotspot development. e eciency of the shaded module peaks from 11:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. thereaer the eciency starts declining due to increase in temperature a
