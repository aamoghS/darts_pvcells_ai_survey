o estimate the time dependence of the temperature of the portion of PV cell 
(ArHS
 ) under hotspot conditions. Two series of interconnected RC circuits are present in the thermal model. He upper RC circuit in Fig.r4 demonstrates the temporal functioning 
ArHS
 during full or partial shading as a function of 
Pdiss,
 the power dissipated in the shunt resistor
