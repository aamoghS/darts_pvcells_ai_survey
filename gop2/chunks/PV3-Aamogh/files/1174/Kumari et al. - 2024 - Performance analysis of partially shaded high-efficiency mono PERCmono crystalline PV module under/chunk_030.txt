 outputs under shad-ing. However, Vigni etal., 2015 demonstrated that incorporating an extra DC/DC converter and modications in the conguration of the PV system could upscale the arrayÂ’s energy yield by 30% and power losses by shading can be recovered by 13%16. e authors presented dierent congurations of seriesÂ–parallel combinations to lessen the eect of partial shading. However, the eect of by-pass diode was not  considered17. e research article by Indu etal. proposed a novel Su Do
