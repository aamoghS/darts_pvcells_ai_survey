acteristics are noted. It should be noted that for some temperature directly depends on concentration of leakage current. e temperature increase is inuenced by the region where the power is  dissipated11. e outdoor experiment will present a thorough impact on thermal and electrical properties due to shaded PV cell. e operation of diode conduction depends on two phenomenathe amount of shading and the shape of the IV characteristic obtained under a shaded scenario. e measured temperature
