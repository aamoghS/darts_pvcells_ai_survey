jects73.To authenticate the eectiveness of our experimental process under partial shading condition, the paper presents statistical results of power output, eciency, hotspot temperature. e results presented in this work is in good agreement with the work done by Ghosh etal. and Ahan etal. Similar testing procedure on single cell shading but with dierent array conguration was adopted by authors Ghosh etal. e observed results showed increase in temperature up to 80.7Â°C in 3 Ã— 1 string
