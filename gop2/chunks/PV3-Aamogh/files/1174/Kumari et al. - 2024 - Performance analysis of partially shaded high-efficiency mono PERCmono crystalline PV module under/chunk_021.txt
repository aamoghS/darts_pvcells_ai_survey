single cell in case of commercial PERC modules that could cause hotspot to develop. e extended part of the research nds out the maximum eAciency and duration when the maximum eAciency is achieved in several shading percentages. Hence the work provides following key contributions as:1.  Critically analyses of the environmental impacts on high eAciency commercial monocrystalline PERC PV Module and analyse the vulnerability of PERC technology towards partial shading and hotspot development.2.
