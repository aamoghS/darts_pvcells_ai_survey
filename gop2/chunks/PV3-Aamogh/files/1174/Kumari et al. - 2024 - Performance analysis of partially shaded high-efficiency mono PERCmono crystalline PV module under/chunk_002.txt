are performed using Sun‑simulator and the I–V and P–V curves are analysed. Further, the outdoor experiments were performed under realistic conditions. In both cases, results showed that during 40–60% shading in single cell leads to critical shading scenario causing significant drop in power output in comparison with their unshaded conditions. The maximum power loss of 36.34% and 42% is recorded for indoor and outdoor experiments. The outdoor experiments recorded hotspot temperature of 85
