d-installed solar modules. Using the arrangements described in Fig.11, each shade prole is tested over one day. e readings are noted down from 08:15:00 to 17:30:00 for every minute with the help of data loggers. e module temperature during unshaded conditions is recorded to be in a range of 5559°C for the entire day.When cell is stimulated with 20% shading, the temperature rises a maximum value of 70°C. A sharp increase in shaded cell temperature is observed when the shading is increas
