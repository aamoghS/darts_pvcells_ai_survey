tting-edge techniques aim to increase the resilience of PV technology in various conditions including shading. In one of the recent research studies, the authors proposed a novel circuit design to mitigate the hotspot in PV Module by employing a dual stage current comparator. rough this technique, the hotspot temperature of 55°C dropped to 35°C and the output power increased by 5.3%37. Another novel circuit for hotspot mitigation is proposed by authors Ghosh etal. where the circuit named a
