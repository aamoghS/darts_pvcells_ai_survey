f non-uniformity of solar radiation using infrared  techniques33. e research study showed that shading ratios from 40 to 60% potentially increased the temperature of the shaded portion from 25 to 105°C,  respectively34. Even the new design technology is facing hotspots due to shading responses. In an experiment, shingled modules showed a greater tendency to build a hotspot than half-cut modules when both modules are exposed to the same shading responses. e hotspot of 145°C temperature was
