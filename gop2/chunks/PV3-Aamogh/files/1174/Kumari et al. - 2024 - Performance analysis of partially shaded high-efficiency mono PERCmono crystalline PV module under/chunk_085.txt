s have demonstrated the occurrence of multiple steps in IV characteristics and multiple notches in PV curves of the shaded PV  modules45,46. Multiple local maxima were found in simulation and experimental studies conducted on a 72 mono-crystalline cells 180W PV. e author found that such a condition is very dangerous and can source permanent  damage47. Even type of distribution of shadow can cause damage to the PV Module. In this context Bayrak etal. 2017 demonstrated the inuence of verti
