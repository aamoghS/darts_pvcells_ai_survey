 induction heating to band a new borosilicate glass to the Kovar alloy ends. Authors used Kovar 
pre-oxidization experiments to measure the relation curves of Kovar oxidation weight gain during 
heating. The  preoxidation of Kovar and the sealing process are guided by a series tests to measure the gas 
tightness, sealing strength, seal interface microstructure and thermal shock. Authors observed that the 
results show that excellent glass-to-Kovar sealing can be obtained with a Kovar oxidation w
