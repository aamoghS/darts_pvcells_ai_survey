ype compound parabolic trough solar collector made of mild steel and its surface coated with an aluminum foil of thickness 10 micron as a selective surface. This prototype has been tested with top cover for instant water heating and steam generation application. The performance of collector has been evaluated with receiver coated with selective absorber coatings. This line focusing parabolic trough yields instantaneous efficiency of 60 % with top cover. Actual field experimentation for performan
