N shinde worked out thermal performance of 
parabolic dish solar water heater with truncated cone shaped helical coiled receiver made up of copper 
and coated with nickel chrome at focal point. Instantaneous efficiency of 63.9% has been achieved with 
the system explained in this paper. [10] From the literature cited, it can be seen that the systems with top 
covered CPC trough collectors with different coating materials are under research and can prove a good 
application for industrial heating
