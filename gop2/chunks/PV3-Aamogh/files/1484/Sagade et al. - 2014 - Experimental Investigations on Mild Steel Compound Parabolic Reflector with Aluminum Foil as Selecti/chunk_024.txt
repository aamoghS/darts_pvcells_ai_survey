c parameters about the 
concentrator are compared with that of the conventional parabolic trough solar concentrator. Authors also 
discussed the factors that have influence on the performance of the unit and it is indicated through the 
analysis that the new trough solar concentrator can actualize reflection focusing for the sun light using 
multiple curved surface compound methods. Authors also conclude that it has the advantages of 
improving the work performance and environment of high-temper
