higher implied Voc than A. This is because the firing temperature will induce the out-diffusion of the species containing hydrogen from the AlO
X
 layer. The O
2
 rich gas environment will form a thicker oxide layer between the silicon substrate and AlO
X
 layer. Table 2 shows the order of the hydrogen diffusion coefficients in the dielectric films [12-14]. The diffusivity of the hydrogen in the SiO
2 
under such a high firing temperature is two orders higher than in the AlO
X
. So, obviously mo
