orders higher than in the AlO
X
. So, obviously most of the species containing hydrogen will diffuse into the SiO
2
 layer. This forms a hydrogen rich SiO
2
 film, and furthermore reduces the defect density between the Si/ SiO
2
 interface.  In thermal treatment A, the N
2
 rich gas environment results in a thinner SiO
2
 layer. There is not enough space to accommodate the hydrogen species. So, most of the species will out-diffuse from the AlO
X
 layer and are then stuck in the SiN
X
, which act
