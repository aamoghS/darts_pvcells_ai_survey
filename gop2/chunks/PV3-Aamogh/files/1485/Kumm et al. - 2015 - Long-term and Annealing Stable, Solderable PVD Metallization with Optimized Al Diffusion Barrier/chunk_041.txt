ith the module temperatures on a German site as in Ref. [6], we obtain a yearly silver consumption of 4.65 nm. Therefore 150 nm Ag in solder stack 1 are expected to be sufficient for a module lifetime of 30 years on a German site. Cell-interconnector that are soldered after annealing on an Al/TiN/NiV/Ag metallization scheme (stack 2) with 50 nm NiV and 15 nm Ag show a strong adhesion even after thermal ageing for 360 h at 130°C and even 150°C. Since a failure of the solder-joints has not yet b
