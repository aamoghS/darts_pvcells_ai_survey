uth, 15 cm height and no backside shield. The system with changeable 8 m2 background, such as sand, white foam (as snow) and raw grass was applied. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Solar cell  Liquid boron ink was spun on the surface homogeneously and baked immediately at 150�� for about 1min. The emitter and BSF was formed in quartz furnace step by step, while front and rear contact with Ag-Al and Ag paste respectively. Solar cells were measured by commercial solar simulator under STC 25�
