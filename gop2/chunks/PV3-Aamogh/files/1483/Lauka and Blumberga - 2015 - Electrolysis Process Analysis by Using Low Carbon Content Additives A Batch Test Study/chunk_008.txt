line water electrolysis and solid oxides water electrolysis and consumed water at anode with proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. The last difference between technologies is the temperature at which these technologies operate. For alkaline water 
electrolysis and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, temperature is under 100 °C, but for solid oxides, the water electrolysis temperature is between 650 °C and 1000 °C [2]. Alkaline water electrolysis is a mature technology [1, 2].
