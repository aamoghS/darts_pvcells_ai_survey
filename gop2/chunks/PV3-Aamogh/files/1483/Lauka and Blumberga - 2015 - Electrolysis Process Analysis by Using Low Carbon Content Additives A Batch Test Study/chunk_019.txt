model that the user anticipates will fit the results of the experiment once it has been performed. The model in DOE Wizard can be selected from five types of process factors models. In the fifth step, a selection of runs is made. This step is useful for the experiment where more than three factors were analysed. In this experiment seven runs were conducted. The sixth step in DOE is evaluation of design, the experimental design can be evaluated using tables, graphs and equations. Tables give anal
