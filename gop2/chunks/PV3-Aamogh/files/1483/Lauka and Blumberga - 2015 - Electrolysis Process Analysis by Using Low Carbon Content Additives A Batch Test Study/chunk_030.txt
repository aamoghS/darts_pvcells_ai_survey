le is less than 0.05, there is a statistically significant relationship between pH and mixture at the 95.0 % confidence level. The R-Squared statistic indicates that the model as fitted explains 60.57 % of the variability in pH.  The correlation coefficient equals �í0.78, indicating a moderately strong relationship between the variables.  The standard error of the estimate shows the standard deviation of the residuals to be 0.54.  Another test to validate the effects of variables is the half-
