easurement. The experimental apparatus was connected with a glass tube which was filled with soap. Measurements started when the first bubble crossed the first section measuring line. With the second method it is not possible to measure hydrogen because of low hydrogen production (no bubbles in experimental period comparing to reference experiment). There may be several reasons why it was not possible to measure hydrogen from the electrolysis process. The first reason is the sampleâ€™s character
