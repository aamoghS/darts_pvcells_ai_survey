Scheme of electrolysis (left side). 3.Results and discussion Using experimental planning four experiments with three center points were carried out. In the experiment biomass ashes were used to analyze possibilities of ash use as an electrolyte component. . The main factors in the experiment were temperature and ash mixture ratio (moisture and diameter of the sample as controlled factors, where for the all samples they are equal).  The ex
