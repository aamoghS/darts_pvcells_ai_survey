hazardous catalysts are mineral and Lewis acids, organic and inorganic bases and toxic metallic compounds. Also 
there are groups of solids catalysts like metals, oxides, sulfides, carbon and bulk materials or those supported on a more or less catalytically active support like silica, alumina, zirconia, titania, ceria, carbon and others. The catalysts mentioned have specific chemical properties, such as acid-base or redox or dehydrogenating or hydrogenating or oxidizing,
