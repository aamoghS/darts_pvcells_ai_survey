Fine-Tuning (WIP)

Included here are two Python notebooks to help fine-tune and train language models:

    A scripted notebook (work in progress)

    An open-source notebook from Unsloth

Both are designed to guide or automate the fine-tuning process using popular open-source tools.

Run both in google colab.

The scripts are functional and can be used to fine-tune models, but they still need further testing and evaluation to ensure they consistently improve performance across different datasets and tasks. With a well-structured, task-relevant dataset, either notebook has the potential to lead to meaningful improvements in model output.
