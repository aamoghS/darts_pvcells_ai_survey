Since this fail ure mode can trig ger sig nif i cant and rapid power losses, it is con sid ered among the most crit i cal fail ure modes with a high fi nan cial im pact. In sights in the phys i cal mech a nism of the per for mance loss and its dri ving fac tors are crit i cal to de velop adapted char ac ter i za tion meth ods and mit i ga tion so lu tions. PID in p - type so lar cells is trig gered by sodium (Na ⁠ ) that dif fuse s into stack ing faults of the sil i con lat tice, caus ing shunt paths through the pn - junc tion. In ad di tion, it is hy poth e sised that for bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells pos i tive charges, such as Na ⁠ + , ac cu mu late in/ on the neg a tively charged AlO ⁠ x rear pas si va tion layer due to the po ten tial dif fer ence be tween the glass and the rear cell sur face. This sig nif i cantly in creases sur face re com bi na tion. How - ever, the degra da tion be hav iour ob served in bi fa cial monocrys talline p - PERC so lar cells un der PID stress from both sides (bi fa cial PID stress) does not match with just one of the degra da tion mech a nisms. A com pre hen sive test ma trix was car ried out to un der stand the phys i cal ori gin of PID in front emit ter bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells in a glass/ glass pack ag ing. The re sults show that bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells un der bi fa cial PID stress suf fer from both shunt ing of the pn - junc tion and in creased sur face re com bi na tion at their rear side. Hereby, we prove that the glass/ glass pack ag ing in com bi na tion with bi fa cial so lar cells can sig nif i cantly in crease the sever ity of PID. 1. Introduction Over the last decade, po ten tial - in duced degra da tion (PID) has been proven to be one of the ma jor and most fre quently oc cur ring re li a bil ity is sues of crys talline sil i con pho to voltaic (PV) cells and mod ules [ 1 ]. Car - o lus et al. [ 2 ] re ported degra da tion losses of up to 100% in the out put power of full - size PV mod ules af ter 96 h of PID stress ac cord ing to the stan dard IEC62804 - 1 [ 3 , 4 ]. In the field, this re sults in ma jor tech ni cal risks and fi nan cial losses for PV plant own ers [ 5 ]. Be sides, un der stand - ing and mit i gat ing PID re ceive grow ing at ten tion and im por tance, due to the con sis tently in creas ing op er a tional volt ages in PV plants. In deed, to day, volt ages of 1000 V and more be tween the grounded frame and the so lar cell are not un com mon and they tend to be come com mon prac - tice [ 6 – 10 ]. Ex ten sive re search showed that the degra da tion is due to mi gra - tion of sodium ions (Na ⁠ + ) caused by the elec tri cal field be tween the grounded frame and the so lar cell. The ori gin of such cations is still un - der dis cus sion. While most of the pub li ca tions state that Na is orig i nat - ing from the soda lime glass (SLG), it is pro posed that the so lar cells might be al ready con t a m i nated by Na [ 1 , 11 , 12 ]. Nau mann et al. [ 13 ] coined the term “ PID of the shunt ing type ” (PID - s) and proved that, in case of p - type so lar cells, the Na dif fuses into the stack ing faults of the sil i con lat tice, pen e trat ing through the pn - junc tion. This causes di rect metal lic shunt paths, and there fore a sig nif i cant de crease of the shunt re sis tance (R ⁠ SH ) [9 - 17] . The loss in R ⁠ SH ex presses it self as a re duc tion of the fill fac tor (FF) in the IV char ac ter is tic. The short cir cuit cur rent (I ⁠ SC ) and the open cir cuit volt age (V ⁠ OC ) are not af fected sig nif i cantly for PID - s lev els of less than 40%. Once the gen er ated power out put of the PV mod ule has de graded for more than 40% by PID - s, the I ⁠ SC and V ⁠ OC are de creas ing dras ti cally [2,18] . In ad di tion, Luo et al.

[ 8 ] for rear junc tion so lar cells. The term “ PID of the po lar - iza tion type ” (PID - p) was sug gested later for sim i lar in ter dig i tated back con tact (IBC) so lar cells by Nau mann et al. [ 20 ]. Luo et al. [19] hy - poth e sized that in bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells the neg a tive charge in the AlO ⁠ x rear pas si va tion layer is can celled out by pos i tive charges, such as Na ⁠ + ions, de te ri o rat ing the proper func tion ing of the pas si va tion layer, and there fore in creas ing sur face re com bi na tion [ 21 ]. This degra da tion mech a nism is wit nessed as a sub stan tial de crease of the I ⁠ SC and the V ⁠ OC while the de crease in FF is neg li gi ble [ 19 ]. Both degra da tion mech a nisms can be pre vented and so lu tions at cell, mod ule and sys tem level are demon strated and find their way to wards in dus trial ap pli ca tions. It has been shown that both PID - s and PID - p can be pre vented at cell level. The anti - re flec tion coat ing (ARC) plays an im - por tant role in PID sus cep ti bil ity. By in creas ing the re frac tive in dex (i.e. by in creas ing the Si ra tio in the SiN X layer), the cell will be less sus cep - ti ble to PID [ 6 , 9 , 22 , 23 ]. At mod ule level, al ter na tive ma te ri als such as PID - free en cap su la tion ma te ri als or borosil i cate glass can be used in the man u fac tur ing stage, so that they ren der PV mod ules PID re sis tant (or so - called “ PID - free ” ). At sys tem level, the ground ing of a PV sys tem can be con fig ured in such a way that the elec tri cal field causes the sodium ions to mi grate away from the so lar cell. How ever, the use of high - ef - fi ciency trans former less in vert ers does not al ways al low this ap proach [1,6,9] . Next to pre ven tion meth ods for new PV mod ules, both PID - s and PID - p are shown to be re versible by ei ther plac ing the so lar cell un der pos i tive bias with re spect to the frame or by in creas ing the mod ule tem - per a ture [1,6,24] . How ever, ther mal cur ing of full - size PV mod ules is tech ni cally im pos si ble to per form in the field. Next to a pos i tive bias or an el e vated tem per a ture of the so lar cell, it has been shown that p - PERC so lar cells af fected by PID of the po lar iza tion type can be re cov ered by light [ 19 ]. How ever, in the run to mit i gate PID from bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells, a bet ter un der stand ing of the phys i cal degra da tion mech a nisms of com - bined PID stress of the front and the rear side (bi fa cial PID) of bi fa - cial p - PERC so lar cells is needed. There fore, we aim to elu ci date the physics of PID in bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells and dis cuss the im pact of mono fa cial PID on both the front side and the rear side of bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells. 2. Experimental set - up Six iden ti cal bi fa cial front junc tion mono c - Si p - PERC so lar cells of 156 mm × 156 mm were lam i nated into six frame less sin gle - cell PV lam - i nates of 200 mm × 200 mm us ing a PID prone en cap su lant, here after re ferred to as sin gle - cell lam i nates. All sin gle - cell lam i nates were pro - duced in ter nally with the same lam i na tion recipe. The im pact of PID on both sides of the so lar cell, here after re ferred to as bi fa cial PID, was in - ves ti gated us ing two 3.2 mm SLG glass/ glass (GG) sin gle - cell lam i nate sam ples. Two trans par ent back sheet/ glass (BSG) and two glass/ back - sheet (GBS) sam ples were used to in ves ti gate rear side PID and front side PID of the so lar cell re spec tively, here after re ferred to as mono fa - cial PID. The GG sin gle - cell lam i nates were PID stressed ac cord ing to the foil - method as de scribed in IEC62804 - 1: “ Test meth ods for de tec tion of po ten tial - in duced degra da tion of crys talline sil i con pho to voltaic (PV) mod ules ” . The foil method was com bined with a tem per a ture of 85 ° C and a rel a tive hu mid ity of 60%. In or der to PID stress the GG sin gle - cell lam i nates, a volt age dif fer ence of 1500 V be tween the shorted so lar cell and the alu minium (Al) foils was ap plied for up to 136 h with the elec - tri cal field point ing to wards the so lar cell. The Al foils were at tached on both the front and the rear side of the GG sin gle - cell lam i nates. In ter - me di ate mea sure ments of the GG sin gle - cell lam i nates were con ducted af ter 23 h, 41 h and 67 h of PID stress. The GBS and BSG sin gle - cell lam - i nates were PID stressed in the same con di tions for 96 h. No in ter me di - ate mea sure ments were con ducted for these sin gle - cell lam i nates. The ini tial ef fi ciency ( η ), I ⁠ SC , V ⁠ OC and FF of the six sin gle - cell lam i nates are shown in Table 1 . It is noted that all sam ples un der went light soak ing prior to the PID ex per i ments in or der to ex clude light - in duced degra da tion (LID) and light and el e vated tem per a ture in duced degra da tion (LeTID) dur ing the PID test. Each side of the so lar cell was light soaked at an il lu mi na tion in ten sity of 200 W/ m 2 in an en vi ron men tal cham ber at 50 ° C for 72 h. To fur ther map the im pact of LID and LeTID, two ref er ence sam ples us - ing a back sheet/ back sheet con fig u ra tion were in cluded in this test. The sam ples were also put un der high volt age stress but did not show any degra da tion, which ex cludes LID and LeTID mech a nisms (re sults not in - cluded in this re port). Since PID re lated ef fects are only ex pected from the glass side of the PV lam i nate, a dif fer ent degra da tion be hav iour can be ex pected be tween the GBS sin gle - cell lam i nates, which are mono fa cially PID stressed at the front side of the so lar cell, and the BSG sin gle - cell lam i - nates, which are mono fa cially PID stressed at the rear side of the so lar cell. This is clar i fied in Fig. 1 , where the ap plied elec tri cal field dur ing the PID stress test is shown. To quan tify the PV per for mance loss un der PID stress, a PV tools Loana PV analy sis sys tem was used for all mea sure ment meth ods.

Bifacial PID of bifacial p - PERC solar cells Two iden ti cal GG sin gle - cell lam i nates (as shown in Fig. 1 a) were bi - fa cially PID stressed for 136 h to in ves ti gate the im pact on both sides of their so lar cell. Fig. 2 shows the nor mal ized degra da tion in power out - put of both the front and the rear side of the GG sin gle - cell lam i nates be fore and af ter 23 h, 41 h, 67 h and 136 h of PID stress. From this, it is clear that the rear side is more af fected by PID than the front side with both a higher degra da tion level as well as a higher degra da tion rate. The light IV curves of the front and the rear side il lu mi na tion mea - sure ments of the first GG sin gle - cell lam i nate at dif fer ent in ter vals of PID stress are shown in Fig. 3 a. Af ter 136 h of PID stress, we ob served un der front side il lu mi na tion a P ⁠ MAX degra da tion of 50% with losses orig i nat ing from FF ( ∼ 37%), V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 18%) and I ⁠ SC ( ∼ 4%). The rear side il lu mi na tion mea sure ments of this sam ple show a 68% P ⁠ MAX degra da - tion, orig i nat ing from FF ( ∼ 37%), V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 29%) and I ⁠ SC ( ∼ 28%). The dark IV curves of the first GG sin gle - cell lam i nate at dif fer ent in ter vals of PID stress are shown in Fig. 3 b. A sig nif i cant de crease in R ⁠ SH from 162 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 to 0.044 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 was found af ter 136 h of PID stress. The same be hav iour was also ob served for the front side of the sec ond GG sin gle - cell lam i nate: un der front side il lu mi na tion a P ⁠ MAX degra da tion of 54% af ter 136 h of PID stress. The losses orig i nate from FF ( ∼ 40%), V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 20%) and I ⁠ SC ( ∼ 6%). How ever, un der rear side il lu mi na tion mea sure - ments, this sam ple shows a 78% P ⁠ MAX degra da tion, orig i nat ing from FF ( ∼ 42%), I ⁠ SC ( ∼ 40%) and V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 36%). This sam ple also shows a sig nif i - cant de crease in R ⁠ SH from 41 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 to 0.034 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 af ter 136 h of PID stress. An overview of the IV pa ra me ter changes for both the front and the rear side of both GG sin gle - cell lam i nates dur ing the PID ex per i ment is shown in Table 2 . The IV mea sure ments of both GG sam ples show that the degra da tion of front - side power gen er a tion is al most equal for both GG sin gle - cell lam i nates, while the degra da tion of rear - side power gen er a tion varies sig nif i cantly. The spread in degra da tion of rear - side power gen er a tion was also ob served in our ear lier PID ex per i ments with bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells (not in cluded in this ar ti cle) and is in agree - ment with the ob ser va tions of Luo et al. [ 19 ] . The IV mea sure ments al - ready show that PID - s is not the only degra da tion mech a nism play ing a role in front emit ter bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells since the V ⁠ OC and I ⁠ SC show a sig nif i cant higher degra da tion level than ex pected ac cord ing to Car o lus et al. [2,18] . This phe nom e non ex presses it self most when the sam ples are char ac ter ized un der rear side il lu mi na tion mea sure ments. The EQE re sponse and EQE ra tio of both the front and the rear side of the first GG sin gle - cell lam i nate at dif fer ent in ter vals of PID stress are shown in Fig. 4 . Front - side EQE mea sure ments show a rel a tive loss in EQE of about 3% in the short - wave length re gion (300 – 400 nm), where the front side of the so lar cell is of in flu ence, and up to 19% in the long - wave length re gion (800 – 1200 nm), where the rear side of the so - lar cell is of in flu ence. Rear side EQE mea sure ments show a sig nif i - cant loss of up to 37% in EQE re sponse for al most the full spec trum (280 – 1000 nm). To bet ter un der stand the phys i cal be hav iour of bi fa cial PID of bi fa - cial so lar cells, mono fa cial PID tests were per formed on both the front and the rear side of the bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells sep a rately. The re sults will be dis cussed be low. 3.2. Monofacial PID of the front side of bifacial p - PERC solar cells Two iden ti cal GBS sin gle - cell lam i nates, as shown in Fig. 1 b, were mono fa cially PID stressed from the front side for 96 h to in ves ti gate the im pact on the front (emit ter) side of the so lar cell. The light IV curves of the front and the rear side il lu mi na tion mea sure ments of the first GBS sin gle - cell lam i nate be fore and af ter PID stress are shown in Fig. 5 a. Af ter 96 h of PID stress, we have ob served un der front side il lu - mi na tion a P ⁠ MAX degra da tion of 31% with losses orig i nat ing from FF ( ∼ 26%) and V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 7%).

The sec ond GBS sin gle - cell lam i nate shows an al - most iden ti cal be hav iour for both the front and the rear side il lu mi na - tion mea sure ments: a P ⁠ MAX degra da tion of 31% with losses orig i nat ing from FF ( ∼ 27%) and V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 7%) at the front side and a P ⁠ MAX degra da - tion of 37%, orig i nat ing from FF ( ∼ 31%) and V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 9%) at the rear side. This sam ple also shows a sig nif i cant de crease in R ⁠ SH from 326 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 to 0.083 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 . Note that the change in I ⁠ SC was neg li gi ble for both the front and the rear side mea sure ments of both mod ules. An overview of the IV pa ra me ter changes for both the front and the rear side of both GBS sin gle - cell lam i nates be fore and af ter PID stress is shown in Table 3 . The IV mea sure ments show the typ i cal be hav - iour of a p - type so lar cell un der PID - s stress with lim ited V ⁠ OC and I ⁠ SC losses for power out put degra da tion lev els of less than 40% [2,18] . The over all degra da tion in power out put of the GBS sam ples is sig nif i cantly less than the degra da tion in power out put of the GG sam ples. In other words, bi fa cial PID stress is more harm ful than mono fa cial PID stress on bi fa cial so lar cells. Fig. 5 b shows the EQE mea sure ments from both the front and the rear side of the first GBS sin gle - cell lam i nate. The EQE mea sure ments from the front side of the sin gle - cell lam i nates show a slight rel a tive de crease in EQE re sponse of up to 7% in the short - wave length re gion (300 – 400 nm), while for longer wave lengths the EQE re sponse re mained un changed. EQE mea sure ments of the rear side of the sin gle - cell lam i - nates show no sig nif i cant change in EQE re sponse. The EQE mea sure - ments con firm that the degra da tion is due to a degra da tion mech a nism oc cur ring at the front side of the so lar cell. The drop in R ⁠ SH to gether with the EQE data sug gests that PID - s is the un der ly ing degra da tion mech a nism oc cur ring at the front/ emit ter side of the so lar cell. Hence Na ⁠ + ion mi gra tion un der in flu ence of the elec tri cal field into the so lar cell.

The sec ond GBS sin - gle - cell lam i nate shows the same be hav iour, but with a sig nif i cant vari - a tion in degra da tion of power out put and PV pa ra me ters: un der front side il lu mi na tions a P ⁠ MAX degra da tion of 10% was ob served with losses orig i nat ing from I ⁠ SC ( ∼ 3%) and V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 5%). The rear side il lu mi na tion mea sure ments of this sam ple show a 28% P ⁠ MAX degra da tion, orig i nat ing from I ⁠ SC ( ∼ 24%) and V ⁠ OC ( ∼ 6%). The FF re mained un changed for both the front and the rear side mea sure ments and a de crease in R ⁠ SH from 47 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 to 10 k Ω cm ⁠ 2 was found. Note that the change in R ⁠ SH of both mod ules have a neg li gi ble ef fect on the power out put since the FF re - mained un changed. An overview of the IV pa ra me ter changes for both the front and the rear side of both BSG sin gle - cell lam i nates be fore and af ter the PID ex - per i ment is shown in Table 4 . The IV char ac ter is tics of the BSG sam - ples also show a degra da tion of the I ⁠ SC which is not in line with our ear lier find ings when the sam ples suf fered from PID - s [2,18] , in di cat ing an other degra da tion mech a nism is play ing a role at the rear side of the bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cell. Fig. 6 b shows the EQE mea sure ments of both the front and the rear side of the first BSG sin gle - cell lam i nate. The EQE mea sure ments of the front side of the sin gle - cell lam i nates show a slight rel a tive de crease in EQE re sponse of less than 3% in the short - wave length re gion (300 – 400 nm), and up to 10% in the long - wave length re gion (800 – 1200 nm). Rear side EQE mea sure ments show a sig nif i cant rel a - tive loss of about 15% in EQE re sponse for al most the full spec trum (280 – 1000 nm). In deed, the EQE mea sure ments con firm that the degra - da tion is due to a degra da tion mech a nism evolv ing at the rear side of the so lar cell. The lim ited de crease of the R ⁠ SH in com bi na tion with the EQE data proves that the un der ly ing degra da tion mech a nism is oc cur ring at the rear side of the so lar cell and that it is not caused by PID - s. The ob ser - va tions are in agree ment with ear lier find ings [ 19 ] and it is be lieved that the un der ly ing degra da tion mech a nism is due to PID - p, hence pos - i tive charge, such as Na ⁠ + , mi gra tion un der in flu ence of the elec tri cal field into the so lar cell. It is hy poth e sized that this causes a de te ri o - ra tion of the neg a tively charged AlO ⁠ x pas si va tion layer, which sig nif i - cantly in creases the sur face re com bi na tion ve loc ity and is ex pressed by a de crease in I ⁠ SC and V ⁠ OC . It should be noted that this degra da tion mech - a nism was ob served at the rear side of all bi fa cial so lar cells stressed from the rear side or both sides. How ever, the P ⁠ MAX loss dif fers sig nif i - cantly be tween two iden ti cal sin gle - cell lam i nates. The fact that PID - p is a sur face ef fect, which means it is sen si tive to small vari a tions in sur face con di tions, e.g. AlO ⁠ x coat ing prop er ties, might pro mote this be hav iour. PID - p of bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells is vi su al ized in Fig. 7 at the rear side of the so lar cell. 4. Conclusions In this work we in ves ti gated the phys i cal ori gin of bi fa cial PID in bi - fa cial mono c - Si p - PERC so lar cells. The test was con ducted ac cord ing to the foil method as de scribed in the stan dard IEC62804 - 1. Our in ves ti ga - tions showed that bi fa cial p - PERC so lar cells suf fer from a com bi na tion of both PID of the shunt ing type as well as PID of the po lar iza tion type. This is vi su ally pre sented in Fig. 7 . Since PID - s is af fect ing the shunt re - sis tance, both the front and the rear side il lu mi na tion mea sure ments of the so lar cell are de grad ing ac cord ing to the same trend. PID - p on the other hand has a lim ited ef fect on the front side il lu mi na tion mea sure - ments. This is caused by the fact that un der front - side il lu mi na tion the col lec tion prob a bil ity of only the high - wave length pho tons is de creas - ing due to the in creased re com bi na tion ve loc ity at the rear side of the so lar cell. Un der rear - side il lu mi na tion mea sure ments, the degra da tion due to PID - p is more pro nounced since the cur rent gen er a tion is also af fected by the low - and mid - wave length pho tons. From the re sults it can be stated that the glass/ glass pack ag ing and the lack of blan ket met - al liza tion at the rear side ren ders such mod ule types more sen si tive to PID. Fur ther more, it has been shown that PID - s and PID - p can be eas - ily dis tin guished by IV and EQE mea sure ments. In the IV char ac ter is tic Fig. 6. a) The IV curves of the front and the rear side of the first BSG sin gle - cell lam i nate be fore and af ter PID stress and b) the front - and rear side EQE mea sure ments of the same sin gle - cell lam i nate be fore and af ter PID stress. 5 UNCORRECTED PROOF J.

Front - side EQE re sponse also shows a spe cific sig na ture for both degra da tion mech a nisms. PID - s ex presses it self by a slight de crease in the short - wave length re gion (300 – 400 nm). Whereas PID - p can be recog nised by a rather sig nif i cant drop in the long - wave length re gion (800 – 1200 nm) of front side EQE mea sure ments.

This  cell  has  a  boron  diffused  front  emitter,  a  tunnel-SiO x /n þ -  poly-Si/SiN x :H  structure  at  the  rear  side,  and  screen-printed  electrodes  on  both  sides.  The  passivation  of  the  tunnel-SiO x /n þ -poly-Si/SiN x :H  structure  on  silicon  wafers  is  investigated.  The  saturation  currents  J o  of  this  structure  on  polished  and  textured  silicon  surfaces  are  1.3  and  3.7  fA/cm 2 ,  respectively.  After  printing  the  Ag  contacts,  the  J o  of  this  structure  increases  to  50.7  fA/cm 2  on  textured  silicon  surfaces,  which  is  still  manageably  low  for  metal  contacts.  This  structure  was  applied  to  i-TOPCon  solar  cells,  resulting  in  a  median  efficiency  of  23.91%,  measured  in-house,  and  a  champion  efficiency  of  24.58%,  independently  confirmed  by  the  ISFH  CalTeC  in  Germany.  The  champion  efficiency  was  measured  with  total  area  illumination,  including  screen-printed  fin - gers  and  busbars.    1. Introduction  In  recent  years,  the  efficiency  of  mainstream  industrial  solar  cells  –  the  passivated  emitter  and  rear  cells  (PERC)  –  has  been  increased  by  about  0.5 – 0.6% abs  per  year  and  is  presently  surpassing  22%  [ 1 – 3 ].  When  approaching  23%  efficiency,  the  majority  of  recombination  losses  will  occur  at  the  metal  contacts.  Hence,  passivating  contacts  have  been  an  intense  research  topic  in  photovoltaics  for  some  years.  Among  the  many  different  materials  and  structures  investigated,  the  Tunnel  Oxide  Passivating  Contact  (TOPCon)  [ 4 ]  has  so  far  attracted  the  interest  from  industry  the  most.  In  the  TOPCon  structure,  the  wafer  is  not  contacted  by  metal  directly.  Instead,  a  thin  tunnel  oxide  and  then  a  heavily  n-  or  p-doped  poly  Si  layer  is  deposited  which,  finally,  is  contacted  by  metal.  Because  the  tunnel  oxide  blocks  one  type  of  carrier,  recombination  behind  the  tunnel  oxide  does  not  influence  device  behavior,  hence  such  structures  are  generally  called  passivating  contacts.  Pioneering  in  in - dustry  was  SunPower  Corporation  with  their  interdigitated  back  contact  (IBC)  cell  in  2010  [ 5 ].  Meanwhile,  both  laboratory  world  records  for  homo-junctions,  either  both-side  contacted  or  rear-contacted,  contain  such  passivating  contacts:  the  n-type  TopCon  cell  from  ISE  Freiburg,  Germany  with  25.8%  efficiency  [ 6 , 7 ],  and  the  p-type  POLO-IBC  cell  from  ISFH,  Germany,  with  26.1%  efficiency  [ 8 ],  both  on  4  cm 2  desig - nated  area.  Inspired  by  those  excellent  research  achievements,  the  attempt  to  introduce  passivating  contacts  to  industrial  solar  cell  manufacturing  is  irresistible.  Some  industrial  requirements  need  to  be  considered,  though.  Firstly,  silicon  wafers  with  large  area  need  to  be  used,  presently  with  a  size  of  156.75  mm  � 156.75  mm  or  161.7  mm  � 161.7  mm.  Sec - ondly,  a  deposition  system  for  poly-silicon  with  a  high  throughput  is  required.  There  are  at  least  three  different  systems  aiming  to  have  mass  production  capability:  low-pressure  chemical  vapor  deposition  (LPCVD)  [ 9 ],  inline  plasma  enhanced  CVD  (PECVD)  [ 10 ],  and  inline  atmospheric  pressure  CVD  (APCVD)  [ 11 ].  To  the  best  of  the  authors ’  knowledge,  the  mass  production  verification  of  those  deposition  systems  for  PV  industry  * Corresponding  author.  ** Corresponding  author.

Finally,  the  third  important  requirement  is  the  metallization  of  the  poly-Si  thin  film.  Obviously,  screen  printing  with  high  temperature  firing  is  the  easiest  way  for  process  integration.  The  difficulty  is  to  protect  the  tunnel-oxide/poly-Si  thin  film  from  the  destruction  of  the  firing-through  paste  at  high  temperature.  The  firing-through  paste  removes  any  thin  poly-Si  layer  and  intrudes  Ag  nanoparticles  into  c-Si,  increasing  the  saturation  current  J o  of  the  passivating  contact  area  [ 12 ].  The  saturation  current  density  at  metal  contacts  was  reported  to  be  35  fA/cm 2  by  Ref.  [ 13 ].  Poly-Si  films  with  thickness  above  150  nm  can  bear  the  high  temperature  firing  but  these  poly-Si  films  have  a  higher  absorption  coefficient  than  c-Si  [ 14 ]  and  cause  parasitic  absorption  losses.  Therefore,  developing  suitable  metal  pastes  is  a  challenging  task  for  the  PV  industry  at  the  moment.  Despite  these  challenges,  in  the  view  of  the  levelized  cost  of  electricity  (LCOE),  n-type  TOPCon  cells  are  promising  candidates  to  become  mainstream  after  PERC  efficiency  reaches  about  23%  [ 15 ].  We  started  the  passivating  contact  research  in  2015  with  the  purpose  for  mass  production.  We  call  our  solar  cells  with  passivating  contacts  i-  TOPCon  (‘i ’  stands  for  ‘industrial ’ )  [ 16 ].  In  February  2018,  our  best  i-TOPCon  cell  reached  23.03%  front  efficiency  and  17.87%  rear  effi - ciency,  accredited  by  JET  in  Japan  [ 17 ].  In  this  report,  we  introduce  our  newly  developed  i-TOPCon  cells  from  our  R & D  line  with  a  maximum  efficiency  of  24.58%,  and  an  open-circuit  voltage  of  716.8  mV,  inde - pendently  confirmed  by  ISFH  CalTeC,  Germany.  Such  cells  are  currently  in  mass  production  at  Trina  Solar,  as  reported  elsewhere  [ 18 ].  2. Experimental  2.1. Tunnel-SiO x /n þ -poly-Si  fabrication  The  tunneling  layer  SiO x  is  grown  thermally  in  the  LPCVD  tube.  In  our  industrial  surroundings,  we  lack  analytical  equipment  for  such  thin  films  and  estimate  the  oxide  thickness  via  ellipsometry  on  alkaline  polished  silicon  wafers  to  be  1.3 – 1.7  nm.  Controlling  the  tunneling  thickness  during  the  process  is  critical  and  is  fine-tuned  empirically.  The  poly-Si  layer,  at  least  partly  polycrystalline,  is  deposited  on  top  of  the  tunnel  oxide  in  the  same  LPCVD  tube.  Processing  poly-Si  thin  films  by  LPCVD  is  well  established  in  the  semiconductor  industry  [ 19 ].  We  use  an  industrial  LPCVD  system  with  a  capacity  of  1200  wafers  per  load.  Silane  is  used  as  the  gas  source.  The  thicknesses  of  the  as-deposited  poly-Si  films  are  measured  with  a  scanning  electronic  microscope  (SEM)  as  shown  in  Fig.  1 .  In  one  experiment,  the  deposition  time  was  varied  to  obtain  several  thicknesses  of  poly-Si  films.  From  correlating  thickness  with  deposition  time  in  Fig.  1 (c),  we  obtained  a  deposition  rate  on  polished  and  textured  silicon  wafers  of  about  3.3  nm/min  and  about  3.1  nm/min.  The  as-deposited  intrinsic  poly-Si  is  subsequently  doped  with  a  POCl 3  diffusion  to  form  n þ -poly-Si,  which  is  necessary  so  tunneled  electrons  find  a  state  in  the  conduction  band,  and  also  to  pin  the  Fermi  level  in  the  poly-layer  so  electrons  become  accumulated  in  front  of  the  tunneling  layer  and  –  last  but  not  least  –  to  reduce  SRH  recombination  at  the  wafer/oxide  interface.  To  investigate  the  surface  passivation  effect  of  this  structure  on  silicon  wafers,  symmetrical  samples  on  5   cm  n-type  Cz  silicon  wafers  were  fabricated  for  measuring  the  effective  lifetime  and  J o .  To  study  the  influence  of  surface  morphology  on  the  passivation,  one  group  of  the  samples  was  polished  in  a  10%  KOH  solution  at  80  � C  for  3  min,  the  other  group  was  pyramid  textured  in  a  2%  KOH  solution  containing  an  additive  at  70  � C  for  6  min.  After  polishing  or  texturiza - tion,  the  samples  were  cleaned  with  a  standard  RCA  cleaning  procedure.  Then  the  tunnel  oxide  was  grown  on  both  sides,  followed  by  the  intrinsic  poly-Si  deposition.  The  thicknesses  of  intrinsic  poly-Si  on  polished  and  textured  surface  were  estimated  to  be  297  nm  and  279  nm  respectively  based  on  the  deposition  rate  described  in  previous  paragraph.  Then  the  intrinsic  poly-Si  was  doped  with  a  POCl 3  diffusion  followed  by  an  RCA  cleaning.  To  supply  enough  hydrogen  for  passivation,  SiN x :H  thin  films  were  added  on  both  sides  by  PECVD.  Finally,  the  samples  were  fired  with  Fig.  1. SEM  pictures  of  SiO x /n þ -poly-Si  stacks  on  (a)  alkaline  polished  Si  wa - fers  and  (b)  textured  wafers,and  (c)  the  thickness  of  poly-Si  measured  by  SEM  as  a  function  of  deposition  time.  D.  Chen  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     an  industrial  belt  firing  furnace  with  a  peak  temperature  of  ~760  � C.  The  effective  excess  carrier  lifetime  was  measured  with  a  Sinton  WCT-  120  set-up  in  quasi-steady  mode,  and  the  surface  J o  values  were  extracted  with  the  method  of  Kane  and  Swanson  [ 20 ]  applying  pro - cedures  described  in  Ref.  [ 21 ]  and  using  in  the  data  evaluation  the  intrinsic  carrier  density  of  8.6  � 10 9  cm � 3  (the  value  at  25  � C).  The  passivation  ability  of  the  tunnel-SiO x /n þ -poly-Si/SiN x :H  stack  after  metallization  was  also  investigated.  The  same  type  of  samples  with  pyramid  textured  surfaces  as  in  the  above  J o  measurement  were  screen  printed  with  Ag  contact  lines  at  one  side  only,  having  9  different  pitches.  Then  the  Ag  paste  was  fired  through  the  nitride  in  an  industrial  belt  firing  furnace  with  the  finger-side  facing  down,  at  the  peak  firing  tem - perature  of  760  � C.  Afterwards,  the  fingers  were  etched  off  with  aqua - regia  solution  ( V HCl : V HNO 3 ¼ 3:1).  Finally,  the  samples  were  rinsed  in  DI  water  and  spin  dried.  Photoluminescence  images  of  the  samples  were  taken  with  a  BTi-LIS-R1  from  BT  Imaging,  and  the  J o  values  for  the  9  respective  metallization  fractions  f  were  extracted  with  the  same  Sinton  WCT-120  tool  as  the  above  J 0  measurements.  2.2. i-TOPCon  solar  cell  fabrication  The  stacks  were  integrated  into  n-type  bifacial  solar  cells,  named  i-  TOPCon  solar  cells.  The  cell  structure  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  2 .  It  features  a  front  boron  emitter  and  a  rear  passivating  contact,  with  screen-printed  fingers  on  both  sides  to  obtain  bifaciality.  The  phosphorus-doped  wa - fers  contain  only  low  amounts  of  oxygen,  with  a  resistivity  range  of  about  0.5   cm  to  1   cm.  The  cell  fabrication  sequence  is  indicated  in  Fig.  3 .  The  wafers  are  double-side  textured  with  random  pyramids  in  a  KOH  solution.  After  RCA  cleaning,  the  boron  emitter  is  formed  in  a  boron  diffusion  furnace  using  a  BBr 3  source.  The  rear  boron  diffusion  is  removed  by  a  single  side  etching  process  using  HF/HNO 3 .  After  chem - ical  cleaning,  a  tunneling  SiO x  is  thermally  grown  and  an  intrinsic  poly-  Si  film  (at  least  partly  polycrystalline)  is  deposited  in  a  LPCVD  system.  The  intrinsic  poly-Si  is  doped  in  a  POCl 3  diffusion  furnace  subsequently  to  convert  to  n þ -poly-Si.  Another  single  side  etching  process  is  applied  to  remove  the  front  side  wrap-around  poly-Si.  After  another  RCA  cleaning,  the  boron  emitter  is  passivated  with  dielectric  films,  which  also  acts  as  an  anti-reflective  coating  stack.  The  rear  side  SiO x /n þ -poly-Si  stack  is  coated  with  PECVD  SiN x :H.  For  metallization,  an  “ H-  metal-contact ”  pattern  with  9  busbars  is  screen  printed  on  both  sides,  followed  by  a  fast  firing  process  with  a  peak  temperature  of  about  760  � C.  After  fabrica - tion,  the  IV  curve  and  other  valuable  parameters  are  measured  with  a  Sinton  FCT-450  flasher.  3. Results  and  discussions  3.1. Passivation  properties  of  the  tunnel-SiO x /n þ -poly-Si/SiN x :H  structure  The  poly-Si  thin  films  were  “ ex-situ ”  doped  with  POCl 3  diffusion  in  a  standard  furnace.  By  optimizing  the  diffusion  process,  excellent  surface  passivation  was  achieved  on  both  polished  and  textured  surfaces.  Fig.  4  shows  the  injection  dependent  saturation  current  J o ,  which  for  polished  and  textured  surface  are  1.3  and  3.7  fA/cm 2 ,  respectively,  at  their  maximum  at  the  excess  carrier  density  of  3  � 10 15  cm � 3  [ 21 ].  The  results  are  close  to  previous  literature  values  [ 9 ],  where  the  poly-Si  films  were  also  deposited  by  LPCVD.  For  the  passivating  contact,  firing-through  Ag  paste  was  used  for  metallization.  As  the  paste  may  deteriorate  the  passivation  ability  of  the  Fig.  2.

For  the  extraction  of  J 0  from  the  effective  excess  carrier  lifetime  data,  the  intrinsic  carrier  density  of  n i  ¼ 8.6  � 10 9  cm � 3  is  used  (value  for  25  � C).

Chen  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     stack,  we  screen-printed  samples  with  9  different  metallization  fractions  as  described  in  Section  2.1 .  Fig.  5  shows  the  photoluminescence  (PL)  of  a  sample  after  firing  and  removing  the  Ag  contact  lines.  The  J 0  of  the  metallization  regions,  J 0,cont,  was  extracted  from  the  local  J 0  measure - ments  using  the  formula:  � 0 ; tot ¼ � 0 ; pass ; front þ ð 1 � � Þ � 0 ; ���� ; ���� þ �� 0 ; cont ¼ � � 0 ; cont � � 0 ; pass � � þ 2 � 0 ; pass (1)  The  total  saturation  current,  J 0,tot ,  is  the  sum  of  the  passivated  front  side  ( J 0,pass,  front )  and  the  rear  side,  which  had  metallization  fraction  f  and  therefore  is  taken  as  the  sum  of  contacted  and  passivated  parts.  The  second  line  of  equation  (1)  assumes  that  the  passivation  of  the  uncon - tacted  parts  has  the  same  quality  at  the  front  and  at  rear  side.  Fig.  6  shows  J 0,tot  vs.  f .  From  equation  (1) ,  the  slope  of  J 0,tot  vs.  f  is  equal  to  J 0,  cont  -  J 0,pass ,  and  the  intercept  with  the  y-axis  is  equal  to  2 J 0,pass .  In  Fig.  6 ,  the  resulting  J 0,cont  is  50.7  fA/cm 2 ,  and  the  resulting  J 0,pass  is  4.4  fA/cm 2 .  Indeed,  the  Ag  paste  degrades  the  passivation  effect  of  the  stack.  Further  improvement  may  come  from  developing  a  better  suitable  Ag  paste  for  poly-Si,  or  from  using  alternative  metallization  methods  such  as  evap - oration.  The  rear  side  metallization  of  our  bifacial  solar  cells  is  around  6%,  therefore  the  total  J o  at  the  rear  side  of  the  cells  is  estimated  to  be  7  fA/cm 2 .  The  above  analysis  shows  that  the  passivating  contact  has  an  excel - lent  passivation  performance.  Furthermore,  for  device  application,  the  electron  transport  must  be  successful  in  order  to  maintain  a  low  series  resistance  of  the  solar  cell.  The  research  of  electron  transport  through  thin  SiO x  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  work.  There  exist  two  different  models  for  the  carrier  transporting  across  the  SiO x  interface,  the  tunneling  model  [ 22 ]  and  the  pinholes  model  [ 23 ].  Nevertheless,  both  show  low  contact  resistivities  of  the  SiO x /n  þ -poly-Si  structure  [ 22 – 24 ].  3.2. Application  of  the  tunnel-SiO x /n þ -poly-Si/SiN x :H  structure  on  i-  TOPCon  solar  cells  In  a  small  experiment,  two  groups  of  i-TOPCon  solar  cells  with  the  rear  side  SiO x /n þ -poly-Si/SiN x :H  structure  were  fabricated:  one  is  the  baseline,  the  other  is  with  an  improved  process  to  enhance  the  infrared  spectral  response.  The  IV  parameters  were  measured  with  the  Sinton  FCT-450  flash  tester  as  listed  in  Table  1 ,  however  without  precise  reference  cells  available  and  with  home-made  probe  bars  at  that  time.  Hence,  the  short  circuit  current  J sc  and  fill  factor  FF  may  be  inaccurate.  The  median  cell  efficiency  of  the  baseline  group  is  23.86%,  with  a  maximum  efficiency  of  24.09%.  And  the  median  efficiency  of  the  improved  group  is  23.91%,  Fig.  5.

Chen  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     with  a  maximum  efficiency  of  24.14%.  J sc  of  cells  from  the  improved  group  are  0.2 – 0.3  mA/cm 2  higher  than  in  the  baseline  group.  From  spectral  response  measurements  made  later  at  the  ISFH  CalTeC,  shown  in  Fig.  7 ,  we  conclude  that  the  gain  in  J sc  is  due  to  the  better  spectral  response  at  long  wavelength  between  1000  and  1200  nm,  which  de - pends  on  the  deposition  conditions  of  the  poly-Si  layer.  The  Sinton  FCT-450  flash  tester  also  measures  the  effective  lifetime  � eff ,  shown  in  Fig.  8 (a),  from  the  decay  of  illumination  level  and  V oc  and  using  the  procedures  described  in  Ref.  [ 25 ].  At  the  maximum  power  point  ( V mpp )  condition,  � eff  is  about  900   s,  however  is  significantly  lower  at  the  open-circuit  ( V oc )  condition  due  to  thermal  donors.  Therefore,  the  cell ’ s  total  J o  is  larger  near  V oc  than  near  V mpp ,  causing  an  increase  of  FF  as  discussed  in  Ref.  [ 26 ].  Hence,  thermal  donors  do  not  increase  the  efficiency,  they  decrease  V oc  and  hence  increase  FF .  We  do  not  know  the  reason  why  � eff  decreases  at  low  injection  densities  so  strongly.  The  sum  of  J 0  of  the  front  side  and  the  rear  side  of  solar  cells  are  extracted  from  the  inverse  � eff  with  Auger  correction,  as  shown  in  Fig.  8 (b):  a  low  J 0  down  to  25  fA/cm 2  is  reached.  The  total  lumped  R s  is  measured  by  comparing  the  sun- V oc  curve  with  the  IV  points  measured  at  1-sun  and  is  0.320   cm 2 .  The  Sinton  FCT-450  software  performs  also  an  automatic  power  loss  analysis.  The  recombination  losses  in  the  diffused  regions  and  in  the  base  region,  respectively,  are  given  in  percent  of  J sc :  � 0 ð �� þ � ��� Þ �� � 2 � � �� � 100 (2)   �� �� � ���� � �� � 100 (3)   while  the  resistive  losses  are  given  in  percentage  of  voltage  loss  to  the  maximum  power  voltage  if  there  were  no  series  resistance,  the  R s -free  pV mpp  ¼ V mpp  þ J mpp R s :  � ��� � � � ��� þ � ��� � � � 100 (4)  Fig.  9  shows  the  results.  The  dominating  loss  is  from  recombination  at  the  front  side  and  rear  side  of  the  cells.  Since  the  rear  side  is  well  passivated  by  the  passivating  contact,  we  know  that  the  major  loss  comes  from  the  boron-diffused  front  side  emitter.  Improving  the  emitter  and  its  metallization  still  bears  a  large  potential  for  further  efficiency  improvements.  Several  solar  cells  were  sent  to  ISFH  CalTeC  for  third-party  certifi - cation.  Particularly  9  contact  bars  were  used  for  contacting  the  front  9  busbars  of  solar  cells,  and  a  brass  copper  chunk  which  with  high  reflection  and  high  conduction  was  used  to  contact  the  other  side  of  solar  cells.  The  best  bifacial  solar  cell  reached  a  front  side  efficiency  of  24.58%,  and  a  rear  side  efficiency  of  19.48%,  on  its  full  244.62  cm 2  wafer  area  including  metal  fingers  and  bus  bars,  without  using  any  dedicated  aperture  during  the  illumination.  The  IV  curves  and  IV  pa - rameters  of  this  champion  solar  cell  are  shown  in  Fig.  10 .  The  fill  factor  is  high  due  to  thermal  donors  [ 26 ],  as  outlined  above.  The  bifaciality  is  79.25%  according  to  the  difference  of  efficiency  under  front  side  illu - mination  and  under  rear  side  illumination.  Fig.  8.

(For  interpretation  of  the  references  to  colour  in  this  figure  legend,  the  reader  is  referred  to  the  Web  version  of  this  article.)  D.  Chen  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     4. Modeling  Numerical  device  modeling  with  Sentaurus  [ 27 ]  is  used  for  a  detailed  loss  analysis.  The  silicon  parameters  are  taken  from  Ref.  [ 28 ]  with  an  update  from  Ref.  [ 29 ]  for  Auger  recombination,  leaving  the  small  ma - terial  uncertainties  given  in  Ref.  [ 30 ].  The  J 0  measurements  were  reproduced  with  simulations  using  measured  ECV  dopant  profiles  as  input,  where  the  surface  recombina - tion  velocity  S  is  extracted  as  the  only  free  parameter  to  assess  the  passivation  quality.  Somewhat  surprisingly,  S  of  the  tunnel  oxide  is  not  lower  than  reported  in  literature  [ 31 , 32 ]  about  oxides  at  the  surface  where  no  poly-Si  was  used,  implying  that  the  n þ -poly-Si  layer  does  not  improve  oxide  passivation.  In  our  understanding,  outlined  in  Ref.  [ 33 ],  this  makes  sense:  SiO 2  is  passivated  mainly  by  the  H þ species  because  the  dominating  P L  dangling  bonds  are  donor-like  (the  amphoteric  U M  states  do  not  contribute  to  recombination  as  much).  The  H þ species  is  abundant  in  both  configurations  [ 34 ]:  when  (i)  the  n-type  wafer  is  passivated  by  both  SiO 2  and  n þ -poly-Si  or  (ii)  by  SiO 2  only.  In  contrast,  p  þ -poly-Si  layers  improve  SiO 2  passivation  significantly  compared  to  solely  SiO 2  on  boron-diffused  surfaces  because  the  p  þ -poly-Si  provides  an  abundance  of  H þ .  Our  finding  implies  for  the  n  þ -poly-Si  passivating  contacts  in  general  that  the  low  J 0  values  are  mainly  achieved  by  opti - mizing  the  phosphorus  dopant  profile  caused  by  diffusion  of  phosphorus  from  the  n þ -poly-Si  layer  through  the  tunnel  oxide  into  the  Si  wafer.  Basically,  the  poly  layer  is  a  limited  phosphorus  source  and  the  tunnel  oxide  acts  as  a  welcome  limitation  to  phosphorus  diffusion  but  is  not  passivated  better  than  oxides  at  the  surface.  In  our  case,  the  n þ -poly-Si  layer  is  doped  about  1.5  � 10 20  cm � 3 ,  but  the  peak  doping  concentration  at  the  oxide  is  near  10 19  cm � 3 ,  and  the  diffusion  reaches  about  80  nm  deep  into  the  wafer.  Our  device  simulations  in  Fig.  11  show  that  there  is  about  ten  times  more  recombination  at  the  tunnel  oxide  than  there  is  in  the  bulk  of  the  diffusion  (the  80  nm  deep  wafer  region  below  the  SiO x  layer),  thus  the  passivation  quality  of  the  tunnel  oxide  plays  a  significant  role.  To  assess  the  amount  of  recombination  losses  in  the  various  device  regions,  we  integrate  the  recombination  rates  over  these  regions  and  plot  them  in  Fig.  11 .  Although  these  losses  are  simulated  locally  with  the  local  split  of  the  quasi-Fermi  energy  levels,  the  losses  are  plotted  with  the  external  voltage  V ext  because  it  is  V ext  that  matters  for  device  efficiency.  Fig.  11  indicates  that  the  cell  is  well  optimized  because  the  main  recombination  losses  have  similar  magnitude  at  mpp:  in  the  base  region  (dominated  by  Auger),  in  the  bulk  of  the  emitter,  at  its  surface,  and  at  its  metal  contacts.  The  losses  at  the  rear  passivating  contact  are  far  smaller  despite  the  screen-printing  assessed  in  the  previous  chapter.  Crucial  (and  most  uncertain  in  the  simulations)  are  the  recombination  losses  at  the  emitter  contacts;  they  can  easily  dominate  the  losses  at  the  front  if  the  chosen  screen-printing  paste  and  the  firing  conditions  are  not  as  optimized.  The  simulated  total  lumped  R s  is  0.389   cm 2 ,  which  is  higher  than  0.320   cm  [ 2 ]  measured  with  the  Sinton  tester.  The  comparison  of  the  simulated  losses  with  the  measured  losses  is  shown  in  Fig.  9 .  The  simulated  recombination  in  the  base  is  0.5  mA/cm 2 ,  hence  0.5/40.57  ¼ 1.23%  of  J sc  as  measured  with  the  Sinton  tester;  the  simulated  recombination  in  the  diffused  regions  is  1.3/40.54  ¼ 3.20%  compared  to  the  measured  3.29%.  While  the  recombination  losses  agree  well,  the  simulated  resistive  losses  are  higher:  simulated  is  0.389  � 39.0/(622  þ 0.389  � 39.0)  ¼ 2.38%  of  V mpp ,  compared  to  the  measured  2.0%.  This  may  be  due  to  the  strong  injection-dependence  of  � eff  near  and  below  mpp,  which  may  not  be  caused  by  homogeneous  recombi - nation  but  by  other  effects.  A  ray  tracing  analysis  with  SunSolve  from  PV  Lighthouse  [ 35 ]  re - veals  that  the  optical  losses  are  dominated  by  escape  at  long  wave - lengths  followed  by  front  reflectivity,  followed  by  parasitic  absorption  losses  in  the  poly-Si,  which  are  only  0.035  to  0.06  mA/cm 2  depending  on  the  deposition  conditions  of  the  poly-Si  [ 36 ].  5. Conclusions  In  our  development  of  i-TOPCon  cells,  it  was  instrumental  to  use  a  series  of  test  samples  and  elaborated  analysis  for  reaching  an  indepen - dently  confirmed  champion  efficiency  of  24.58%.  The  reported  Fig.  10.

Simulated  recombination  losses  of  the  indicated  device  regions.   D.  Chen  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     efficiency  is  on  large  wafer  including  metal  fingers  and  bus  bars,  full  illumination,  and  fabricated  with  industrial  equipment  (no  photo-  lithography  etc.).  The  analysis  shows  that  recombination  losses  in  the  emitter,  including  its  bulk,  surface  and  metal  contacts  are  limiting  the  device  performance,  while  the  rear  passivating  contact  has  a  low  J 0  of  less  than  7  fA/cm 2 ,  including  the  94%  non-metallized  region  with  J 0  ¼ 3.4  fA/cm 2  as  well  as  6%  metallization  area  with  J 0  ¼ 50.7  fA/cm 2 .  We  conclude  that  improving  the  emitter  and  its  metallization  still  bears  a  large  potential  for  further  efficiency  improvements.  This  may  be  done  with  further  development  of  a  conventional  emitter  structure  and  its  metallization  paste,  or  with  replacing  it  by  a  transparent  passivating  contact.  In  our  opinion,  simplifying  the  process  flow  of  poly-Si  passiv - ating  contacts,  as  well  as  developing  a  transparent  passivating  contact  that  is  industrially  feasible,  are  presently  one  of  the  most  urgent  tasks  in  Si  photovoltaic  research  and  development.

For the front film, we implement a one-step plasma oxidation process before depositing silicon nitride on alumina, aiming to enhance the quality of the alumina layer and improve overall passivation. In the case of the rear film, we introduce a NH 3  plasma treatment to elevate hydrogen content of SiN x . These additional hydrogens diffuse into the interfacial silicon oxide during the firing process to help reduce the number of surface dangling bonds and inhibit the degradation of the passivating contacts, which significantly contributes to enhanced passivation quality. Through separate opti - mization of these film layers, we aim to harness the full potential of TOPCon solar cells, achieving remarkable improvements in passivation quality and overall performance. With the help of XRD, SIMS, QSSPC, ellipsometry and other characterization tools, the underlying reasons for the improved passivation quality due to plasma oxidation and plasma hydrogenation were explored. Finally, plasma oxidation and hydrogenation lead to ~0.06 and ~0.07% average efficiency enhancements, respectively.    1.Introduction In recent years, significant advancements have been made in solar cell technologies, with the introduction of Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells being one of the most noteworthy break - throughs [1–5]. TOPCon solar cells have exhibited superior efficiency and passivation properties compared to traditional silicon solar cells, making them an attractive option for large-scale photovoltaic applica - tions. The core of the TOPCon comprises an ultra-thin oxide layer and a heavily doped polycrystalline silicon layer, which enables selective carrier transport, resulting in a combination of outstanding passivation quality and contact performance [6–8]. Regrettably, the application of this passivating contact on the solar cell front side presents challenges due to its intense light parasitic absorption, primarily attributed to the heavily doped polysilicon layer [9]. Indeed, in the current TOPCon solar cell continues the design of traditional solar cells, the front structure employs a boron homogeneous/selectivity emitter in combination with passivation and anti-reflection film layers, such as alumina (AlO x ) and silicon nitride (SiN x ) [10,11]. Furthermore, the polysilicon passivating contact structure, when subjected to the firing process required for metallization, can suffer from substantial degradation in passivation quality [12]. To address this issue, a frequent practice is to shield the polysilicon with a hydrogen-rich SiN x  film, which effectively prevents the occurrence of passivation quality degradation and leads to a notable improvement in the overall passivation performance, due to the pres - ence of hydrogen [13]. The significance of hydrogen content in the structural performance of doped polysilicon passivating contacts has been well-documented in extensive studies. It has been consistently shown that maintaining a higher concentration of hydrogen in the vi - cinity of the ultrathin oxide layer, achieved through various methods, can significantly enhance passivation quality [14–17]. And finally leading to a notable improvement in the electrical performance of TOPCon solar cells [18]. In this work, our primary objective was to optimize the front and rear  *Corresponding author.

The passivation film on the front side of the TOPCon solar cell consists of five distinct layers, arranged from bottom to top as follows: AlO x , two layers of SiN x  with different refractive indices n, silicon nitride oxide (SiO x N y ), and a silicon oxide (SiO x ). This specific combination of layers has been widely adopted by mainstream TOPCon solar cell manufacturers due to its dual benefits in optics and electricity. It effectively achieves excellent surface passivation, minimizing recombination losses, while also providing a notable anti-reflective effect. On this foundation, a one-step plasma oxidation process was implemented prior to depositing SiN x  on AlO x . The purpose of this process was to eliminate oxygen vacancy defects within the AlO x  layer, thus improving its passivating properties. For the rear passivation, a combination of three layers of silicon nitride with different n is used to achieve both passivation and optical performance. As a further optimization, a NH 3  plasma treatment was introduced to increase the hydrogen content before each layer of SiN x  deposition. Through this separate optimization of the front and rear film layers, better passivation quality can be observed without affecting the optical properties and the contact of the metal electrode with the silicon sub - strate. Finally, open-circuit voltage (V oc ) enhancement due to improved passivation quality aids further optimization of TOPCon solar cell con - version efficiency. 2.Experimentals The silicon wafers employed for the fabrication of TOPCon solar cells are of industrial grade, with a size of 182 mm ×182 mm in square and a thickness of ~150   m, the structure of the adopted TOPCon solar cell is schematically shown in Fig. 1. These n-type substrates boast a resistivity range of 0.5–2  cm. Subjecting all wafers to a sequence of standard cleaning and texturing etching procedures. Following by a series of critical processes to established selective boron emitters on the front side of the wafers: thermal boron diffusion, laser treatment, and post thermal oxidation, ensuring controlled sheet resistances of ~250 / in the light doped region and ~90 / in the heavy doped region. Following this step, the borosilicate glass layer was removed from the rear and edge of the wafer, leaving the front surface intact. Subsequently, the wafer underwent an alkali polishing process to remove the boron emitter on the rear and edge. On the polished surface, an ultra-thin tunneling oxide layer, ~1.5 nm, was generated through oxidation with O 2  plasma. This was followed by the deposition of an in-situ phosphorus-doped amorphous silicon layer, ~115 nm thick, using an in-line magnetron sputtering system (JT8000 POPAID, Belightech). Phosphorus-doped silicon targets are used for phosphorus-doped a-Si deposition, and the plasma excited from Ar and PH 3  precursor gases is introduced to in - crease phosphorus content, and the gas flow rate of Ar and PH 3  can be independently controlled by three successively distributed zones. After 860  ◦ C, 30 min thermal annealing at dry N 2  environment, single-sided polysilicon passivating contact structure was formed on the rear [19]. After removing the borosilicate glass and phosphor-silicate glass from the surface of the wafer, the preparation of the anti-reflection passivation film on the front side starts with the deposition of a ~10 nm AlO x  film by an in-line single side deposition atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Ideal Deposition Equipment ����Applications Co., Ltd.), which is the most mainstream commercial TOPCon solar cell AlOx deposition equipment available. Subsequently, SiN x , SiO x N y  and SiO x  were sequentially deposited on AlO x  with a tubular PECVD equipment (M82300-12/UM, Red Solar Photoelectric Technology Co., Ltd.), and in order to further enhance the film formation quality of AlO x , a N 2 O plasma treatment (plasma oxidation, PO) was set up for 120 s prior to the start of the process, and the specific process setup is shown in Table 1. The process involves heating precursor gases, which is then excited by pulsed radio frequency to create a glow discharge, forming a plasma. Two corresponding graphite sheets are subjected to opposite alternating voltage, which accelerates the plasma to impact the gas between the plates. This action propels the plasma towards the surface of the silicon wafer, thereby completing the coating process. For the rear side, three layers of SiN x  with different refractive indices were deposited sequentially using a same type tubular PECVD, while plasma hydroge - nation (PH) using NH 3  as a precursor gas was performed prior to the deposition of each SiN x , and the main processes are also listed in Table 1. Finally, the fabrication of TOPCon solar cells is completed by going through the standard screen printing and firing process. The I–V characteristics of the TOPCon solar cells are assessed using a solar simulator that replicates sunlight conditions. Quantum efficiency (QE, Enlitech) tester is used to assist in analyzing TOPCon solar cell performance. The evaluation of passivation quality for both the front and rear passivation film layers, both post-deposition and after the firing process, is conducted using implied open circuit voltage (iV oc ). This parameter is obtained using Quasisteady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) measurements performed under 1-Sun equivalent light in - tensity with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester [20]. An ellipsometry (EMPro-PV, ELLITOP) is used to monitor the refractive index and thickness variations of the deposited film. X-ray Photoelectron Spec - troscopy (XPS) (Axis Ultra DLD, KRATOS) equipped with an Al K   monochromatic X-ray source (h   =1486.6 eV) was utilized to compare the impact of plasma oxidation on the deposited AlO x  layers. Addi - tionally, in order to evaluate the impact of plasma hydrogenation on the hydrogen content within the SiN x  layers, we utilized Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS 5 iontof, PHI Nano - TOFII). This analysis employed a Cs +primary ion at 10 kV, with the sample set at a �5 kV potential to detect negative secondary ions. The analysis was performed with an impact energy of 15 kV. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Plasma oxidation The impact of the PO treatment on the properties of the AlO x  film is visually illustrated through the O 1s core level spectra within the X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) results, as displayed in Fig. 2a. Prior to the peak fitting process, the Shirley background, accounting for inelastically scattered electrons, was eliminated. From the O 1s peak, peaks at ~530.8 eV and ~532.9 eV were meticulously deconvoluted. These correspond to the O–Al–O bands of Al 2 O 3  and Al–OH bands of Al (OH) 3 , respectively. We used the peak areas of the O–Al–O and Al–OH contributions within the O1s core levels to analysis the ratio changes of Al 2 O 3  to Al(OH) 3 . The band ratio is only 1.22 in AlO x  films that have undergone only the same thermal process without plasma treatment, whereas the application of plasma oxidation increases the ratio to 1.66 [21,22]. It stems from the design of our industrial in-line ALD system, which effectively balances capacity and cost considerations. In the sys - tem, the sample is conveyed on a transfer plate through the  Fig. 1.Schematic diagram of the adopted commercial TOPCon solar cell structure.  W. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H 2 O chambers, undergoing recirculation until the desired thickness is achieved. However, the absence of strin - gent demarcation between the TMA and H 2 O regions gives rise to a less than optimal quality in the deposited AlO x  film. It tends to harbor a significant quantity of oxygen vacancy defects and Al–OH bonds that fail to break in time, which remain intertwined due to their overlapping deposition processes. The integration of the PO process resulted in an elevation of the O–Al–O bond ratio, which can be attributed to the vigorous high-energy plasma bombardment, causing the rupture of O–H bonds. Consequently, the released Al and O from plasma reconfigure to form additional O–Al–O bonds, that aids in mitigating oxygen vacancy defects. Simultaneously, the liberated hydrogen from the fractured O–H bonds permeates into both the AlO x  film and the AlO x /Si interface [23]. The collective impact plays a pivotal role in diminishing the density of defect states on the Si wafer surface. As a result, the effect of PO process on the values of the pre-metallization samples as shown in Fig. 2b. The PO process effectively improved the iV oc  values, and the average iV oc  values increased by more than 2 mV compared to untreated samples, both as-deposited and after firing, while at the same time the dispersion of the data distributions was much smaller, indicating that the homo - geneity of the passivation had been significantly improved. The final average electrical performance comparisons of TOPCon solar cells are shown in Table 2. The addition of extra PO treatment to the deposition process of the front surface passivation film helps the TOPCon solar cell to obtain an average V oc  gain of 1.3 mV. In addition, the fill factor (FF) is also obtaining a slight rise. There are two possible reasons for this, one is the higher V oc  due to better surface passivation quality which helps to increase the FF, and the other is that the PO treated AlO x  film may be more easily penetrated by the metal paste to obtain lower contact resistivity. The overall effect on the cell conversion efficiency is an absolute average efficiency gain of 0.06%. The comparative analysis of QE and reflectance in Fig. 3 reveals that the PO treatment induces a marginal increase in reflectance within the 300–400 nm wavelength range. This change can be attributed to the slight alteration in the optical properties of the AlO x  films resulting from the PO treatment. Specifically, the refractive index n of AlO x  demon - strates a decrease from 1.63 to 1.60 by PO, as measured by ellipsometry. However, no significant effect on the AlO x  thickness is observed following the PO treatment. Furthermore, the PO treatment has a  Table 1 PO and PH process setting table for the front and rear film deposition process.

Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    notably positive impact on the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) per - formance within the 300–400 nm wavelength range, due to the improved quality of the front surface passivation as shown in Fig. 2b. Nonetheless, the gain in external quantum efficiency (EQE) is not as apparent due to optical losses, which underscores the primary reason that the electrical performance enhancement resulting from the PO process primarily manifests in the V oc  gain, while any changes in I sc  are not readily discernible. 3.2.Plasma hydrogenation The impact of PH treatment on the distribution of H atoms within both the SiN x  layer and the polysilicon passivating contact structure is elucidated through SIMS analysis, as showcased in Fig. 4a. Following the completion of SiN x  deposition, the PH treatment leads to a notable in - crease in H content within the deposited SiN x  layer can be measured, escalating from ~6 ×10 21  to ~1 ×10 22  cm �3 . However, it exerts a lesser influence on the H content within the polysilicon layer as well as the tunneling oxide layer. Consequently, at this stage, PH treatment does not result in a significant change in passivation quality, as demonstrated in Fig. 4b. Upon subjecting the samples to the firing process, an essential step in the metallization of TOPCon solar cells, H atoms commence diffusion within the polysilicon passivating contacts and the underlying silicon substrate [24]. Notably, these H atoms accumulate near the interface SiO x , consistent with findings reported in the literature [25]. In samples that underwent the PH process, the H content within the pol - ysilicon and silicon substrate, particularly in the vicinity of SiO x , is significantly higher compared to samples without PH treatment. This enrichment of H atoms near SiO x  proves beneficial as it contributes to a reduction in the density of unsaturated suspended bonds on the silicon surface. Moreover, the higher H content more effectively inhibits the passivation quality degradation of the passivating contacts during the firing process [13,26]. The outcome is evident in the samples subjected to PH treatment, displaying higher mean values of iV oc  (~2.1 mV higher than samples without PH treatment), accompanied by a reduction in the dispersion of iV oc  values, as shown in Fig. 4b. This clear trend un - derscores the pronounced effect of PH introduction in enhancing passivation quality. In addition to enhancing passivation quality, PH treatment proves beneficial in elevating the overall electrical performance of TOPCon solar cells, as evidenced by the results presented in Table 3. The improvement in passivation quality contributes to a notable V oc  enhancement of approximately 1.1 mV. Importantly, there are no sig - nificant differences observed in the performance of I sc  and FF. This outcome aligns with the observation that PH treatment exerts minimal influence on the thickness and refractive index of the final SiN x  film, as determined by ellipsometry analysis. Finally, TOPCon solar cells achieve ~0.07% average conversion efficiency gain by PH processing. 4.Conclusions In conclusion, our study has highlighted significant achievements in the optimization of TOPCon solar cells, with two key approaches on the anti-reflection passivation films. Firstly, for the front side film, we implemented a one-step PO process utilizing N 2 O plasma. This process remarkably enhanced the quality of the in-line ALD-deposited AlOx film by repairing the oxygen vacancy defects within it. The disruption of O–H bonds during this process additionally released H, contributing to passivation quality enhancement, evident by an impressive ~2 mV in - creases in iV oc , which ultimately resulted in a 0.06% improvement in efficiency. Furthermore, the application of the PH process prior to the deposition of each SiN x  layer on the rear side of the cell demonstrated compelling results. The SIMS analysis showed a significant increase in H content within SiN x  post-deposition. After the firing process, these H atoms diffuse towards the passivating contact and silicon substrate, becoming enriched in the SiO x  region. This enrichment effectively re - duces the number of surface dangling bonds and helps inhibit the degradation of the passivating contact during firing. Consequently, the iV oc  value of the PH-treated sample demonstrated a substantial ~2.1 mV increase compared to the untreated sample post-firing. This enhance - ment in the final electrical performance translated to an average effi - ciency gain of ~0.07% for the TOPCon solar cells. The observed improvements in passivation quality and electrical performance demonstrate the potential of these optimization strategies in advancing TOPCon solar cell technology.

In this work, we prepared a hole-selective passivating contact of Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag and applied it to the rear of the p-type tunneling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cell. It is found that the ultrathin atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al 2 O 3  as a tunneling layer played an essential role in improving the hole selectivity of Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structures, and the optimal thickness of the tunneling layer Al 2 O 3  is ~ 0.56 nm. An ultra-low resistivity of 1.84 m‧cm 2  was obtained on the Al 2 O 3  (0.56 nm)/MoO x  (7 nm)/ Ag (120 nm) structure. Benefiting from the high-performance hole selectivity, the highest efficiency of 21.16% was successfully achieved on the p-type TOPCon solar cell, which to our knowledge is the highest efficiency of the MoO x -based p-type TOPCon solar cells. This work demonstrates that the hole-selective passivating contact of Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag possesses great potential in the full-area carriers-selective contacts based solar cell.    1.Introduction Tunneling Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells with poly- Si (n þ )/SiO 2  structure have been becoming one of the most competitive commercial crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells (Chen et al., 2020; Glunz et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021), attributing to the high conversion effi - ciencies and the high process-compatibility with the baseline of the passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs). The high output performance of the TOPCon lies in the excellent electron-selectivity properties benefiting from the high level of passivation of tunneling oxide layers and the excellent conductivity of poly-Si (n þ )/SiO 2  (Chandra Mandal et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2019; Khokhar et al., 2021). However, the poly-Si (n þ )/SiO 2  structure-based TOPCon solar cells suffer from two major limitations. Firstly, the poly-Si (n þ )/SiO 2  struc - ture requires high-temperature processes, including thermal oxidation （~900 ℃）and ~450 ℃ plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). Secondly, the poly-Si (n þ ) layer has significant parasitic ab - sorption, and thus limits the output performance of the bifacial TOPCon solar cell. To address the issues imposed, wide-bandgap transition metal oxides (TMO) with low parasitic absorption (Gerling et al., 2016b) have attracted many research interests because these thin films can be easily prepared through the low-temperature and simple techniques such as thermal evaporation, atomic layer deposition (ALD), spin coating and magnetron sputtering. Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2016) developed a TiO 2  (~2.5 nm, ALD) film based electron-selective contact, achieving low surface recombination (S eff  ~11 cms �1 ) and low contact resistivity (  c  ~0.02 mcm 2 ) at the silicon and metal interface simultaneously. Wan et al. (Wan et al., 2017) demonstrated a TaO x  (~6 nm, ALD) as an electron-selective contact, resulting in high-quality passivation（J 0  ~22.5 fA/cm 2 ）and the low contact resistivity (  c  ~0.35 mcm 2 ) to the silicon surface. Furthermore, the hole-selective contacts generally exhibit lower selectivity than the electron-selective contacts (Schmidt et al., 2018). Hence, it is necessary to improve the surface passivation and holes conductivity to improve the performances of the hole-selective-contacts- based TOPCon solar cells. Many TMOs can be promising candidates for high-performance hole-selective contacts, such as molybdenum oxide (MoO x ) (Battaglia et al., 2014), nickel oxide (NiO x ) (Hossain et al.,  *Corresponding author at: School of Science, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang 222005, Jiangsu Province, PR China.

Among these candidates, molybdenum oxide (MoO x ) is the most widely investigated material due to the wide bandgap (~3 eV) and high work function (WF), leading to an upward band bending at the silicon interface (Messmer et al., 2018). Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2018) deposited a 9 nm MoO x  film on top of c-Si by thermal evaporation, achieving a J 0  of 187 fA/cm 2  and a   c  of 82.5 mcm 2 . Cao et al. (Cao et al., 2019) studied the heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells with full-area rear MoO x /Ag (thermal evaporation sequen - tially) contacts, achieving an efficiency of 18.49%. Nevertheless, MoO x  does not offer sufficient passivation in contact with silicon. Al 2 O 3  film is usually deposited on the front of the cell by ALD (Boryło et al., 2016), acting as an antireflection coating and providing passivation (Dobr - za´nski et al., 2014; Drygała et al., 2016; Szindler and Szindler, 2021). ALD ultrathin Al 2 O 3  film is promising tunneling for a hole-selective contact because of the excellent chemical and field-effect passivation (Chowdhury et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2015; Leszek et al., 2015; ¨O˘gütman et al., 2020). Based on the hole-selective Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack, Sen et al. applied it to the front side of the TOPCon device and achieved an efficiency of 18.2% (Ah Sen et al., 2021). However, the passivation superiority of the tunneling passivation layer Al 2 O 3  and the holes con - ductivity of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack were not fully demonstrated. In this work, an Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure as the hole-selective contact was prepared on the full-area rear of the p-type c-Si TOPCon solar cell utilizing low-temperature ALD and thermal evaporation techniques. Firstly, the structural composition of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack was represented in the way of transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), respectively. Secondly, the thickness dependence of the ALD-Al 2 O 3  tunneling layer on the passiv - ation effect and the conductivity of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure for holes were investigated. Finally, the optimal Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure was applied to the full-area rear surface of the p-type TOPCon solar cell (53 ×53 mm 2 ), achieving the highest efficiency of 21.16%, revealing the high hole selectivity of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure. 2.Experimental process 2.1.Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack deposition and device preparation The device structure consists of a front Ag/SiN x /SiO 2  contact (Huang et al., 2019) and a rear Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag contact. The square (53 ×53 mm 2 ), boron-doped p-type, solar-grade, CZ c-Si wafers (〈100〉) acted as substrates, with a thickness of ~180   m and the resistivity of ~2.0 cm. The wafers were textured in a NaOH etching solution, followed by the standard cleaning process. Then n � emitter was prepared on the front of the wafer by laser-doped POCl 3  diffusion in a quartz tube furnace (800  ◦ C) for 40 min. The wafers underwent a smoothing etch to remove the phosphorous silicate glass (PSG). Then, the wafers were cleaned in an RCA 1 ����2 (Kern and Puotinen, 1969) and dipped in the HF (5%) solution to remove the native SiO x . Then SiO 2  was formed by dry thermal oxidation in a tubular type furnace (850℃), with 8 L/min oxygen flow rate and 0.6 Å/min growth rate. The thicknesses of the SiO 2  were ~1.5 nm. The PECVD-SiN x  layers were deposited to protect the emitter surface by the NH 4 /SiH 4  reaction (SC-TD-450C). SiO 2  on the rear of the samples was removed by HF (5%), and the wafers were classified into three groups. The first group (G1) wafers were coated with a thickness of 120 nm Ag layer (full area) by thermal evaporation at the rear. The second group (G2), MoO 3  (~7 nm)/Ag (120 nm) stack was deposited successively at the rear of wafers by thermal evaporation without air break. The third group (G3), the rear side of wafers were grown with the ultrathin Al 2 O 3  film (8 cycles) by ALD at 150℃ (the Al 2 O 3  growth per cycle is ~0.69 Å), and MoO 3  (~7 nm)/Ag (120 nm full area) were conducted respectively on top of Al 2 O 3  by thermal evapo - ration without air break. Finally, the Ag grids of all group (G1, G2 and G3) cells were screen printed and fired at 800℃ approximately (CF- Series, Despatch). Solar cell structures of G1, G2 and G3 are shown in Fig. 1. 2.2.Characterization The structure p-Si/Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag (2 nm/10 nm/120 nm /~180   m) was prepared. MoO x  (10 nm) and Ag (120 nm) films were deposited respectively by thermal evaporation on a wafer with a single side ALD- Al 2 O 3  film (30 cycles, ~2 nm) deposition for TEM (FEI Talos). XPS was utilized to confirm the elemental composition in a vacuum (below 2 ×10 �9  mbar). The X-ray source is monochromatic Al K   (h   =1486.68 eV) calibrated with the carbon reference. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Regulus8100, Hitachi, Japan) was used to observe the cross- section of the device and analyze the stack distribution on the back of the device. To investigate the surface passivation performance of Al 2 O 3 , the quasi-steady-state photoconductance decay tester (Sinton WCT-120) was used to measure the effective minority carrier lifetimes (  eff ) of the samples at the minority carrier concentration of 1 ×10 15  cm �3 . Single- side deposited samples were prepared to measure the contact resistivity (  c ) by the transfer length method (TLM). The pad spacing of the shadow mask is 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mm, and the electrode width is 3 mm. A MoO x /Ag (~7 nm/120 nm) stack was thermally evaporated on top of Al 2 O 3  by a shadow mask (Liu et al., 2021). The dark cur - rent–voltage (I-V) measurements were performed through a four-probe station. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were measured with the platform of quantum efficiency measurement (PV Measurements QEX10). A BERGER Lichttechnik Single Cell Tester investigated I-V characteristics of the solar cells under the AM1.5 illu - mination (Crown Tech IV Test Station 2000). 3.Results and discussions 3.1.Characterization of Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack In order to investigate the structural composition of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack, the structure of c-Si/Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag was prepared. Firstly, 30 cycles of ALD Al 2 O 3  film were deposited, forming a thickness of ~2 nm.  Fig. 1.Solar cell structures for (a) p-Si/Ag, (b) p-Si/MoO x /Ag, (c) p-Si/Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag.   H. Cheng et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Secondly, after the deposition of the Al 2 O 3  film, MoO x  (10 nm) and Ag (120 nm) layers were deposited respectively by thermal evaporation without air break. Fig. 2(a) shows the 50 nm cross-sectional TEM image of the cell’s rear surfaces (c-Si/Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag). The distribution of Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack can be observed clearly in Fig. 2(b), which is verified in Fig. 3. The cross-section of the device under SEM is shown in Fig. 2(c), with a pyramid structure on the front and an Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure on the back. The Mo 3d core level energy spectra (see Fig. 3(a)) are divided into the two peaks centred at 232.9 and 231.7 eV, respectively, in line with Mo 6+ and Mo 5+ states, oxygen vacancies lead to the appearance of Mo 5+ cations (Kumar et al., 2021). A defect band caused by oxygen vacancies in the MoO x  aids hole transport between the Si valence band and the MoO x  conduction band in the way of trap-assisted tunneling (Vijayan et al., 2018). These oxygen vacancies increase the conductivity of the MoO x  film, which promotes the accumulation of holes (Ramana et al., 2007). Fig. 3(b) shows the core level O 1 s for MoO x  film with a peak centred 530.5 eV, which corresponds to Mo-O bonding. The atomic ratio of O/Mo is estimated to be 2.68 (<3). As seen in Fig. 3(c), 3(d), the core level spectrum of Al 2p and O 1 s are located at 74.8 eV and 531.6 eV, respectively, which correspond to the Al-O bond in keeping with pre - vious reports about XPS of the Al 2 O 3  film (Renault et al., 2002). 3.2.Passivation and conductivity To demonstrate the surface passivation performance of Al 2 O 3 , the   eff  of c-Si wafers deposited with different thicknesses of Al 2 O 3  films was measured (see Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4(a), the samples symmetrically coated with thicker Al 2 O 3  films (30 cycles and 50 cycles) reach a higher   eff  (30.1 us, 18.7 us) after annealing at 425℃ than the   eff  (18.2 us, 2.8 us) of samples without annealing. However, the   eff  of the samples with thinner Al 2 O 3  (6 cycles, 8 cycles and 10 cycles) decreases in the high- temperature annealing (200℃, 300℃ and 425℃). The maximum   eff  of the sample with Al 2 O 3  (8 cycles) without annealing is 51.7 us. Post- deposition annealing improves the lifetime for Al 2 O 3  layers (ALD) thicker than 10 ALD cycles, while for Al 2 O 3  layers thinner than 10 ALD cycles, annealing causes the thickening of the interlayer, which is likely to form Si-O bonds, resulting in the reduction of   eff  (Ah Sen et al., 2021). The passivation performance of Al 2 O 3  with 30 cycles and 50 cycles is improved after high-temperature annealing. However, the thinner Al 2 O 3  is suitable for charge carrier tunneling. In terms of ultrathin Al 2 O 3  films, due to the increase in interface state density, the passivation quality of the ultrathin Al 2 O 3  film deteriorates, which may be caused by the incomplete reaction of trimethyl-aluminium (TMA) molecules in the first ALD cycle (Werner et al., 2011). Nevertheless, attributing to the fixed negative charge, the thinner Al 2 O 3  can provide field-effect passivation. Werner et al. introduced the Al 2 O 3  passivation layer (1 nm) and obtained low surface recombination (S eff  <100 cm/s), which attributes to the high fixed negative charge of Al 2 O 3  film (Werner et al., 2011). The as-deposited ALD is amorphous, consequently no crystallized peaks after deposition. After annealing, it is difficult to assign a phase to each specific peak due to uncertainty about the exact location of the peaks and the presence of several double peaks (Fu, 2021). X-ray diffraction of Al 2 O 3  before and after annealing is carried out, and the test  Fig. 2.Cross-sectional view of the c-Si/Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure under TEM (a) 50 nm and (b) 10 nm, (c) cross-sectional view of the device under SEM.   H. Cheng et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   results are consistent with the reference. Reducing the contact resistance of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack is crucial to implementing ohmic contact with c-Si. TLM was used to measure the   c  of the stack, and I-V measurement results are exhibited in Fig. 4(b). A MoO x  (~7 nm) film and an Ag (120 nm) film were evaporated on the top of the Al 2 O 3  layer to create the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag contact structure by a shadow mask. From the I-V measurements of the different Al 2 O 3  thick - nesses (the same pad spacing), it is clear that the contacts of the samples with thinner Al 2 O 3  (6 cycles, 8 cycles and 10 cycles) showed an ohmic behaviour. After the correlation of the linear fits, the TLM extraction of   c  is 3.66 cm 2 , 1.84 cm 2  and 2.26 cm 2 , respectively. The samples with thicker Al 2 O 3  (20 cycles and 30 cycles) showed a Schottky diode behaviour. 3.3.Solar cells The Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack was applied as a full-area passivation contact to the rear of the p-type solar cell due to the excellent passivation and conductivity.The p-type solar cells with the rear structure p-Si/Ag (G1), p-Si/MoO x /Ag (G2) and p-Si/Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag (G3) were prepared. The G1 and G2 were used as references. The structured image of G1, G2 and G3 are presented in Fig. 1. The EQE curves of G1, G2 and G3 samples are given in Fig. 5(a). The solar cell with the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack shows the highest EQE in the wavelength of 500–1100 nm than the devices without Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack, attributing to excellent passivation perfor - mance and low contact resistivity of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack. Fig. 5(b) shows the current density–voltage (J-V) and power-voltage (P-V) curves of solar cells with the highest efficiency among G1, G2 and G3 samples.

H. Cheng et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Table 1 shows the specific parameters of the devices in Fig. 5(b). V oc  (674 mV) and fill factor FF (84.18%) of the device with the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack are much higher than those without Al 2 O 3  films. The fixed nega - tive charge of Al 2 O 3  can act as a back surface field and provide passiv - ation. Gerling et al.(Gerling et al., 2016b) found that MoO x  had limited inherent passivation because of the high work function, which decreases the density of surface electrons. In contact with elemental Si, MoO x  is not thermodynamically stable (Hubbard and Schlom, 2011), and thus yields high interface recombination velocities (Sun et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack leads to the V oc  increase from 623 mV to 674 mV. In contact with elemental Si, MoO x  leads to an upward band bending because of the high work function, which promotes hole accumulation at the interface and reduces the contact resistivity. Thus, FF increases from 77.87% to 80.55%. Meanwhile, the ultrathin Al 2 O 3  film acts as a tunneling oxide layer, owing to the negative interface charge density of Al 2 O 3 , the holes accumulation is further promoted, resulting in the increase of FF from 80.55% to 84.18%. The result il - lustrates that Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack significantly improves the device performance. Table 2 shows the output parameters of the reference (Cao et al., 2019) and our experiment. Compared to the cells with a full area rear MoO x /Ag contact fabricated by Cao et al., the device based on Al 2 O 3 / MoO x /Ag contact has a V oc  increase of 43 mV, and a FF increase of 3.3%, consequently increasing    from 18.49% to 21.16% (a relative increase of 14.4%). The improvement in device performance is attributed to the excellent chemistry and field passivation of Al 2 O 3  film. More holes are collected by MoO x  films through tunneling oxide layers. Fig. 6 shows that the solar cell obtained the highest efficiency of 21.16% with a V oc  of 674 mV, a J sc  of 37.30 mA/cm 2 , and a FF of 84.18%, whose maximum power is 0.594 W. Compared to the sample without Al 2 O 3 , V oc  and FF of the sample with deposited Al 2 O 3  were increased by 3% and 4.5%, respectively. Inserting an ultrathin Al 2 O 3  between c-Si and MoO x  is an effective method to improve the interface passivation and preserve the hole-selective accumulation by suppressing the reaction of c-Si/MoO x  (Ah Sen et al., 2021). Finally, attributing to the excellent performance of the Al 2 O 3 /MoO x  stack in terms of passiv - ation and conductivity, the highest efficiency of 21.16% of the p-type TOPCon solar cell with Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag is successfully achieved. 4.Conclusions This work demonstrates that the ALD-Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure possesses well hole selectivity for the full-area p-type TOPCon solar cell. The result shows that the ultrathin ALD-Al 2 O 3  thin film acts as a tunneling layer like an ultrathin SiO x  layer, and plays a vital role in improving the hole selectivity of Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure. By optimi - zation of the thickness of ALD-Al 2 O 3 , the highest   eff  of 51.7 us and the lowest   c  of 1.84 m•cm 2  were simultaneously obtained on the Al 2 O 3  (0.56 nm)/MoO x  (7 nm)/Ag (120 nm) structure. Benefiting from the excellent hole selectivity of this structure, we successfully achieved the highest efficiency of 21.16% of MoO x -based p-type TOPCon solar cell, as well as a V oc  of 674 mV, a FF of 84.18% and a J sc  of 37.30 mA/cm 2 . The improvement of hole selectivity of the ALD-Al 2 O 3 /MoO x /Ag structure demonstrates an effective way to the full passivating contacts high- efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells.

However, the high price of precious metals increases the cost of TOPCon cells. Al is a cheap and high-performance conductor, and its work function is compatible with the rear side of TOPCon cells. In this study, we used a UV pulse laser (355 nm, 10 ps) to ablate the rear side SiN x  passivation layer of TOPCon cells and then printed Al paste with different weight percentages of silicon (Si-wt.%) on the phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon (n + -poly-Si) layer to reduce the cost. We investigated the damage mechanism of laser on SiO x /n + -poly-Si/SiN x  passivation structure and the contact mechanism between Al paste and n + -poly-Si layer. The results show that the V oc  of SiO x /n + -poly-Si/SiN x  passivation structure reduced about 6–7 mV when the laser energy density was 0.431 J/cm 2 . We got the best electrical performance of TOPCon cells printed with Al paste (25 wt%-29 wt% silicon). The open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and the conversion efficiency (E ff ), have reached 663.60 mV and 22.56 % respectively. Although the efficiency was 9.40 % relative lower than that of TOPCon cells printed with Ag paste, but the cost of Al paste only accounted for 10 % of Ag paste. In the future, the highest E ff  of TOPCon solar cells printed with Al paste on the rear side are expected to reach the commercial TOPCon based on Ag paste, which applies laser doping selective emitter technology (SE) and bifacial poly-Si passivation structure. 1.Introduction The rapid evolution of science and technology accelerates human development of new energy sources. Cz-Si wafers have the advantage of purity and carrier lifetime, so the photovoltaic (PV) devices based on Cz- Si wafers obtain high conversion efficiency  [1] . Currently, the silicon solar cells include tunneling oxide passivation contact (TOPCon)  [2] , hetero-junction (HJT)  [3] and integrated-back contact cells (IBC)  [4] are been investigated widely. Among them, TOPCon solar cells has been commercial produced extensively due to its excellent passivation structure (SiO x  +n + -poly-Si) and its low cost to upgrade the production lines from PERC solar cells. TOPCon cells ( Fig. 1 ) passivated by ultrathin SiO x  with chemical passivation, and phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon (n + -poly-Si) with electric field passivation  [5–7] , so the excellent passivation mechanism resulting the efficiency record of TOPCon cells refreshed consistently  [2,6,8–12] . Improving efficiency and reducing costs are two key routes to lower the cost per �kWh of TOPCon cells. In the whole TOPCon cells cost of ownership, apart from silicon wafers, the pastes used to form electrodes account for the largest proportion of the cost, especially, if full Ag paste printed on the rear side  [2] . There are numerous reports on the forma - tion mechanism of ohmic contact between Ag paste and n + -poly-Si  [13–16] . However, there are few reports on printing Al paste on n + -poly- Si  [17] , and the contact mechanism of them is also not clear. Therefore, the n-Type Cz_Si wafers were used in this study, and the solar cells were fabricated by commercial route. To inhibit the over - reaction between Al paste and n + -poly-Si, the glass which can burn  * Corresponding authors at: Institute of Intelligent Flexible Mechatronics, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212013, PR China (J.

The fabrication process is shown in  Fig. 2 , and the LCO step was added to the original process before printing Al paste on the rear side. As shown in the flowchart, the wafers were textured in KOH solution to reduce the reflection of light in the front side firstly, then the front boron emitter (p � emitter, 120 /sq) was formed in a quartz tube furnace in the atmosphere of BCl 3  gas. After the p � emitter was fabricated, the rear side of the wafers was polished by HF and HNO 3  mixed solution to remove the boron silicate glass (BSG) and the emitter on the rear side and the edges formed during boron diffusion. The rear side passivation contact structure, which consists of an ultrathin SiO x  (1.6 nm) layer and phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon (250 nm) layer, was formed by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Then, the phosphorous silicate glass (PSG) was single-sided etched with a volume ratio of 15 % HF solution in room temperature (25℃). AlO x  (7 nm) was fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) in the front side of TOPCon cells to passivate the p �emitter, because the AlO x  layer has a large amount of negative fixed charge to prevent the recombination of charge carriers. Finally, both sides of the silicon wafers passivated with SiN x  (70 nm), which was formed by LPCVD. To form good contacts between Al paste and silicon wafers, a UV pulse laser (·×�355 nm, PWM�10 ps, f �1 MHz, size �40   m �40   m) was used to ablate the rear side SiN x  in the metallization area with a speed of 10000 mm/s. The laser was tested with different energy den - sities which were regulated by changing the laser power to minimize the laser damage to silicon wafers ( Table 1 ), and the laser energy density was calculated according to Formula (1).  D energy �P/�f�s�(1)  In the end, Ag/Al paste and full Al paste were screen printed on the front side and rear side of the cells respectively, after that, the cells were sintered in a belt furnace with the curve shown in  Fig. 3 . The addition of silicon in Al paste can inhabit the violent reaction between Al paste and n � -poly-Si, but also decreased the grids conductivity. Thus, the Al paste with different weight percentages of silicon was applied in metallization ( Table 2 ). 2.2.Solar cell characterization The open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current (I sc ), series resistance (R s ), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (E ff ) of cells were measured by an IV tester under 1-sun illumination (AM 1.5). The implied V oc  (iV oc ) and the dark saturation current density (J 0 ) of the control samples were measured by a WCT-120 lifetime tester under the excess carrier density of 3 �10 15 . The transmission line method (TLM) model  [18] was used to measure the line resistance and the contact resistivity ( ∗ c ) of the elec - trode.  Fig. 4 shows the schematic diagram of the TLM method, and the results can be obtained based on Formula (2):  R measured �2R tip �2R c �R s (2)  Rs is the bulk resistance of the n �-poly-Si layer. The Rtip which represents the resistance between the probe and the metal grids, is the same on the same grid. Meanwhile, bulk resistance Rs can be repre - sented by sheet resistance Rsheet, so Formula (2) can be simplified as Formula (3):  R measured �2R c ��R sheet �d�/w(3)  Photoluminescence (PL) images and the loss of iV oc  (÷iV oc ) are used as an indication of damage after LCO. In addition, the microstructure was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to evaluate the ablation state of the SiN x  passivation layer. Moreover, the contact interface of Al paste and n � - poly-Si was analyzed by SEM and EDS as well. Fig. 1.Structural diagram of TOPCon solar cell  [5] . Fig. 2.Fabrication process of TOPCon cells.

As shown in  Fig. 5 b, ÷iV oc  raised with the increase of laser energy density. When laser energy density is lower than 0.413 Jcm �2  or higher than 0.431 Jcm �2 , the increase rates of ÷iV oc  all less than 15 %. How - ever, when the laser energy density increased from 0.413 Jcm �2  to 0.431 Jcm �2 , the ÷iV oc  increased from 4.97 mV to 6.20 mV with up to 25 % growth rate, the effect of laser on SiO x /n � -poly-Si/SiN x  structure has undergone a qualitative change during this period. Moreover, the contact interface of Al paste and n �-poly-Si was analyzed by SEM and EDS as well. When a laser energy density lower than 0.431 Jcm �2  was not suf - ficient to open the SiNx layer, because the energy density was too little low to reach the laser ablation threshold, and the EDS results proved it. When laser energy density is higher than 0.431 Jcm �2 , large areas of n � -poly-Si exposed after laser-radiated, because no nitrogen element appeared in the area. From  Fig. 6 , we find that there are many cracks at the edge of the SiN x  layer after ablation, which is created by the me - chanical stress caused by n � -poly-Si and SiN x . Since during laser ablation, the absorption coefficient(  ) of n � -poly- Si at 355 nm wavelength is several orders of magnitude larger than that of SiN x  [19,20] , the n � -poly-Si layer obtained large energy from the laser, resulting in the temperature increased to the melting point of n � - poly-Si, therefore, a phase transformation (solid  liquid) occurred in n � -poly-Si under laser radiation regions, and the vapor pressure caused by the phase transformation broke down the SiN x  above.

Solar �� Energy �� 280 �� (2024) �� 112862 �� �µ �� short laser pulse time (10 ps), the melted n � -poly-Si recrystallized and solidified into its original state (liquid  solid) rapidly. The rough surface (white box region in  Fig. 6 ) was the result of n � - poly-Si recrystallization, larger energy density laser led to deeper n � - poly-Si recrystallization, as a result, the defects caused by recrystalli - zation brought more carriers recombination, which may explain the trend of ÷iV oc  changes under different laser energy densities effectively. Therefore, the threshold of laser energy density is 0.431 Jcm �2  when the UV picosecond laser worked on the structure of SiO x (1.6 nm)/n � - poly-Si(250 nm)/SiN x (70 nm). Hence, all the silicon wafers in metalli - zation dealt with the laser energy density of 0.431 Jcm �2 . 3.2.Study of the mechanism of Al-Si contact The rear side SiN x  passivation layer in metallization regions was ablated by the laser with 0.431 Jcm �2 . The Ag/Al paste and the Al paste with different silicon weight percentages were screen printed on the front side and rear side of TOPCon cells respectively. In order to achieve a good metal–semiconductor contact, all the silicon wafers were sintered in industrial belt furnace, the actual sintering temperature cure is shown in  Fig. 3 , the peak temperature was 760℃, which is higher than the melting point of Al (660℃). In order to reveal the mechanism of Al-Si contact, we analyzed the Al-Si contact interface on the basis of the Al- Si binary phase diagram ( Fig. S1 )  [21] . The formation of ohmic contact is closely related to the Al-Si alloying process  [22] . The process can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, Al particles in the paste melt slowly and the silicon from paste or n �-poly-Si dissolved in melted Al as the temperature increases (ABC). The second stage is the saturation of silicon dissolved in Al-Si alloy melt occurring at point C (T peak ), and the process lasts for a short time usually. The final stage is the decrease of temperature, during the cooling process of the melt, the solubility of silicon in Al-Si alloy melt decreases, which leads to more silicon precipitate from the melt to form a back surface field (BSF), as a result, the amount of the silicon pre - cipitation affected the thickness of BSF closely. The eutectic temperature of Al-Si is about 577℃, which means that a eutectic reaction happens between Al and Si at this temperature (l   ⋄× �±). When the content of silicon involved in the reaction is between 1.65 % to 12.6 %, the primary phase    (Si-Al solid solution) precipitates slowly with the temperature decreases. When the temperature cools  Fig. 6.Microstructure morphology observed by SEM and element distribution analyzed by EDS over the regions after laser ablated. Y. Ding et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Solar �� Energy �� 280 �� (2024) �� 112862 �� �ν �� down to eutectic temperature (577℃), the remaining liquid undergoes eutectic reaction (L remain      �). However, the solid solubility of Si in Al decreases when the temperature drops below 577℃, at this time, the excessive Si in    phase segregates in the form of the second phase  II , so the final Al-Si hypoeutectic alloy composed of    � � II . However, when silicon content is between12.6 % to 99.83 %, the Al-Si is hyper - eutectic alloy, which is in contrast to hypoeutectic. When the tempera - ture drops to room temperature, excessive Al segregates from the primary phase (Al-Si solid solution) in the form of the second phase   II , so    � �  II  constitute Al-Si hypereutectic alloy at room temperature. To indicate the sintering process,  Fig. 8 (e–f) shows the schematics of Al-Si contacts, if no silicon was added to the Al paste, the Al melt reacted with n � -poly-Si and the TOPCon structure would be destroyed. To protect the passivation structure, different weight percentages of silicon were added into the Al paste, so the Al melt reacted with the silicon from the paste first, and less from n � -poly-Si diffused into the melt. The microscopic morphology and schematic of the cross-section at the Al-Si contact interface as shown in  Figs. 7 and  8 (e–f), when the weight percentage of silicon in Al paste lower than 18 %, there was a clear interlayer between Al-Si alloy and silicon bulk, which caused by the formed of Al-Si solid solutions (±×phase, BSF). The thickness of BSF decreased with the increasing silicon weight percentage in Al paste, when the added silicon was 1 wt%–5 wt%, the thickness of BSF was 3.67   m, and when the silicon in Al paste increased to 9 wt%–13 wt%, the thickness decreased to 3.14   m. However, the total thickness of passivation layers was about 250 nm, so the TOPCon structure was destroyed obviously, and when the silicon in Al paste over 18 wt%, no BSF was observed at the interface. In addition, many voids (the regions marked with yellow circles) appeared in Al-Si alloy, Lauermann et al.  [23] found that the diffusion occurring at 20 � C less than the peak temperature tends to dominate the entire diffusion pro - cess, in addition the diffusion speed of Si is greater than that of Al, therefore, the silicon in Al-Si alloy transfer to the Al layers occurred in the process, which led to the reduction of the silicon content in the melt, and more and more silicon from n � -poly-Si diffused to the melt to maintain phase balance. So, the voids formed in the alloy when the silicon diffused and the melt flow. The shape of metal grids can also affect the performance of solar cells, the aspect ratio (height/width) is used to indicate the performance of the grid after sintering, higher aspect ratio leads to smaller series resistance. In addition, the higher aspect ratio grids decrease the shiel - ded area of light. The aspect ratio of the grids was measured by a confocal scanning laser microscope ( Fig. 8 (a–d)). The Al paste with a low weight per - centage of silicon formed higher aspect ratio grids, because most silicon reached Al melt from n � -poly-Si, even the temperature reached Al melting temperature, but the high-temperature duration was too short, so the Al particles didn’t obtain enough energy to melt, and the grids maintain the original morphology without collapse. On the contrary side, the Al paste with a higher weight percentage of silicon provided enough silicon for Al particles to form Al-Si alloy, therefore, all the Al particles reacted during the sintering process, and led to the grids collapsing, which decreased the aspect ratio. The wafers almost not participate in the reaction, therefore, no silicon diffusion occurred in n � -poly-Si, and no voids formed in the Al-Si alloy. As a result, the size of the metal particles in high silicon weight percentage paste ( Fig. 7 (c) (d)) is larger than that of the metal particles in lower silicon weight percentage paste ( Fig. 7 (a) (b)) after sintering. 3.3.Impact of different silicon weight percentages in Al paste on cell performance The metallization process affected cell performance highly,  Table 3 lists the line resistance and contact resistivity of metal grids measured by  Fig. 7.SEM images of the cross-section of Al–Si contact: (a) the silicon content in Al paste is 1 wt%–5 wt%; (b) 9 wt%–13 wt%; (c) 18 wt%–23 wt%; (d) 25 wt%–29 wt%.

Ding et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ���ar �Λ �nerg� �Λ 2�0 �Λ (2024) �Λ ��2��2 �Λ 5 �Λ TLM. The table values indicate that more silicon addition decreased the conductivity of grids, but reduced the contact resistivity. However, the contact resistivity trend is contradictory to the cross-section images in  Fig. 7 . As we know, ohmic contact was established with the formation of Al- Si alloy, and Al-Si alloy thickness decreased with the weight percentage of silicon in Al paste increase. Combing with the TLM model, we find that, the test current only goes through n + -poly-Si during lateral trans - mission in ideal cells, but in fact, the passivation structure (SiO x /n + -  Fig. 8.SEM images of the cross-section of the Al–Si contact: (a) the silicon content in Al paste is 1 wt%–5 wt%; (b) 9 wt%–13 wt%; (c) 18 wt%–23 wt%; (d) 25 wt%– 29 wt%.

Ding et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ����� �∗ ������ �∗ ��� �∗ (2024) �∗ ������ �∗ �� �∗ poly-Si) was destroyed when the cells printed with low silicon added Al paste, which led to the test current had n + -poly-Si and Cz-Si bulk two paths to go through during lateral transmission. In this case, the R c  in Formula (3) represents the contact resistance between grids and Cz-Si bulk. The metal–semiconductor contact influenced the fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current (I sc ), and efficiency (E ff ).  Fig. 9 describes the performance of the TOPCon cells printed with Al paste on the rear side. Results show that, the Isc has an obvious decreasing trend when the weight percentage of silicon increased. The Al-Si contact interface affected long wave light absorption (900 nm–1000 nm) on the rear side.  Fig. S3 is the EQE of the cells, which indicates that the cells printed with high Si-wt.% added Al paste had a stronger response at long wave than that of printed with lower Si-wt.% added Al paste. Reasonably, the strong response in long wave can increase the Isc, but the EQE curve indicates that these differences are small, so the increasement on the Isc can be ignored. However, there is no doubt that, the increasing Si con - tent in paste makes line resistance higher, resulting in decreasing Isc, the line resistances are listed in  Table 3 . According to the description in  Section 3.2 , the Al paste with low Si-wt.% addition contacted with n + - poly-Si formed thick Al-Si alloy on the rear side, which affected J 0,metal  seriously. In this study, we can calculate J 0,metal  by Formula (4)  [24] .  J 0�total =J 0�bulk +J 0�metal(F) ×f (F) +J 0�passivation(F) ×ζ1�f (F) η+J 0�metal(R) ×f (R) +J 0�passivation(R) ×(1�f (R) )(4)  J 0,total , the total dark saturation current density of the cells can be expressed by formula(4), which is composed of bulk saturation current density J 0,bulk  and surface dark saturation current density, and the values of J 0,total  can be measured by WCT-120(SunsVoc). The surface is divided into front and rear sides, and each side is further subdivided into metallization and non-metallization regions. In formula (4), J 0,passivation  represents the dark saturation current density in non-metallization re - gions, and R and F represent the rear side and front side respectively. The J 0,total  of the cells printed with different Si-wt.% added Al paste (from low to high) are 411fA/cm 2 , 381fA/cm 2 , 315fA/cm 2  and 275fA/ cm 2  measured by WCT-120(SunsVoc) respectively.  Fig. S4 shows the remaining values involved in Formula (4), all the values are measured by WCT-120(Lifetime) (the testing methods in  Section2.2 ) from our previous offline experiments. Specifically, J 0,bulk  cannot be obtained from measurement directly, we obtained J 0,bulk  by Formula (5).  Table 3 Line resistance and contact resistivity of metal grids.

Solar �� Energy �� 280 �� (2024) �� 112862 �� 7 �� J 0 �qWn 2i � ∓ N d (5)  Which J 0  represents J 0,bulk , and q �1.6E-19, which is constant. W is the thickness of Si wafers, n i  �8.89E9cm 3  represents the electron con - centration of intrinsic silicon in 300 K  [25] .  ∓× �3500   s is the minority carrier life time of Si wafers (measured by WCT-120), N d �1E16 repre - sents the P doping concentration in n-type Si wafers. So, the value of J 0, bulk  is 5fA/cm 2  can be obtained by formula 5. According to calculations, the J 0,metal  values are 4955.16fA/cm 2 , 4575.42fA/cm 2 , 3739.97fA/cm 2  and 3233.65fA/cm 2  respectively. The V oc  enhanced with the increase of the weight percentage of sil - icon in Al paste, but the champion V oc  was much worse than that of the cells printed Ag paste on the rear side  [26] . This is because, the appearance of BSF built an electric field, which weakened the electric field passivation of n � -poly-Si and inhibited the transfer of major car - riers (electrons) to the rear side grids.  Fig. 10 describes the transfer of charge carriers in the cells, n � -poly-Si provided a built-in field with the direction from n � -poly-Si to silicon bulk, which was beneficial for the rear side electrode to collect charge carriers. However, the appearance of BSF weakened the ability of electrodes, because the BSF showed p- type semiconductor properties, so a built-in field with the direction from BSF to n � -poly-Si formed by it, which led to most major carriers recombined. As a consequence, the decrease of J 0,metal  promotes the increase in V oc , and in this study, the champion V oc  was 663.6 mV and the efficiency was 22.56 %.  Fig. 11 shows the IV current of the champion solar cell. 4.Failure analysis and outlook Table 4 compares the IV test results of TOPCon cells which printed Ag paste and Al paste on the rear side respectively. Obviously, there is a large gap in V oc  of the cells, the V oc  of TOPCon cells printed with Al paste on the rear side is 7.8 % smaller than that of TOPCon cells printed with Ag paste on the rear side, and the cause of this difference has been explained in Chapter 3.3. So far, printing Al paste on TOPcon cells’ rear side can reduce the costs, but the efficiency cannot match that of TOP - Con cells printed with Ag paste. I believe that in the future, the opti - mization of laser contact opening technology and the superposition of LECO, the V oc  of TOPCon cells which are printed with Al paste on the rear side can be improved partly. Our next work will focus on the impact of the reverse electric field on the rear side. 5.Conclusion This work is dedicated to the development of a new metallization process to reduce the cost of commercial TOPCon solar cells, including laser contact opening (LCO) and screen-printing Al paste on TOPCon cells’ rear side. The results revealed that the laser energy density affected SiO x /n � -poly-Si/SiN x  structure passivation, when we used a UV picosecond laser (355 nm, 10 ps) with an energy density of 0.431 J/cm 2 , the laser caused the least damage to SiO x /n � -poly-Si/SiN x  structure (about 4.97 mV). The weight percentage of silicon in the Al paste affected the contact interface of n � -poly-Si and grids, the Al paste with a low weight per - centage of silicon caused many voids and thick Al-Si alloy, which brought more metal recombination (J 0,metal ) in metallization regions. In addition, the formation of BSF caused by Al-Si alloy decreased V oc  of the cells as well, because the built-in field caused by BSF inhabited the carriers transport and brought more recombination. The Al paste with a high weight percentage of silicon hardly had these situations, so the cells printed with high Si-wt.% added Al paste showed better electrical per - formance, the champion TOPCon cell obtained when printed with the Al paste which has 25-29 wt% silicon, and the cell with V oc  663.6 mV, J sc  40.73 mA/cm 2 , FF 83.48 %, and E ff  22.56 %. Although there is a significant gap in efficiency between TOPCon cells printed with Al paste and Ag paste on the rear side, the use of Al paste on TOPCon cells’ rear side has large economic benefits for commercialization. To improve the V oc  of TOPCon cells which are printed with Al paste on the rear side, the LCO technology optimization, selective emitter (SE) technology, and laser enhanced contact optimi - zation (LECO) technology will be applied in our future work.

However, the poor wettability of the polysilicon film limits the application of the electroplating technology on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells (SCs). In this work, we propose a carbon (C)-doped polysilicon with highly polar C–Si bonds to improve the surface wettability of polysilicon film. By reducing the hydrogen bubble retention during plating, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer can be obtained. To maintain the good conductivity of polysilicon, a double- layer polysilicon structure consisting of a C-doped and a C-free polysilicon films was constructed for TOPCon device fabrication. The new design shows an excellent passivation quality with an implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ) of 745 mV for the lifetime sample and a good contact performance with a low contact resistivity (  c ) of 2–3 m cm 2  between plated grids and polysilicon films. Finally, the proof-of-concept TOPCon devices with the double-layer polysilicon structure and plated metal electrodes deliver a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.18%. Therefore, the C-doped polysilicon combined with the electroplating technology demonstrated in this work shows great potential to obtain high-efficiency and low-cost TOPCon SCs in the PV industry.    1.Introduction High-efficiency and low-cost crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells (SCs) have always been the main subject of the photovoltaic (PV) industry. Currently, the high-efficient c-Si technologies include silicon hetero - junction (HJT) [1,2], tunneling oxide passivation contact (TOPCon) [3–6], and integrated-back contact (IBC) technologies [7,8]. Among them, TOPCon SC is widely recognized as one of the most promising c-Si technologies for the next-generation PV industry due to its high compatibility with the traditional passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) SCs in production lines and relatively low capital cost to upgrade the production lines [5]. However, the front- and rear-sided fingers/electrodes of TOPCon SCs use the high-conductivity silver ma - terials, yielding a large silver consumption and thus an increased ma - terial cost [9]. Ample evidence has shown that the supply of silver is a critical factor limiting the upcoming terawatt (TW)-scaled PV market in the next decade [9]. Therefore, developing metallization schemes with low silver consumption is particularly crucial to reduce material costs and accelerate the market expansion of TOPCon SCs. As a promising alternative metallization technology for the PV in - dustry, copper plating [10–14] has been successfully introduced into the TOPCon devices with the same level of device performance as that of the commonly-used screen-printed silver pastes [15,16].

From an industrialization perspec - tive, plating the metal electrodes directly on the polysilicon films is more desirable to fabricate the TOPCon devices as it could avoid using the costly vacuum physical vapor deposition (PVD) to deposit the metal seed layers. However, it is still challenging to adopt the copper plating technology in mass production, which is mainly due to the poor adhe - sion between plated grids and polysilicon films, leading to reduced de - vice performance and increased risk of peeling and cracking of the plated grids during the subsequent transfer and packaging process [18]. To achieve high-efficiency TOPCon SCs, the rear-side surface of the c-Si substrate is typically textured by a smooth alkali-polished structure to balance the optical and electrical performance with high short-circuit current (J sc ) and open-circuit voltage (V oc ) simultaneously [19,20]. In addition, the poor wettability of the polysilicon layer is one of the key factors limiting the contact performance of electroplated electrodes, which is due to that the poor wettability makes it difficult for the plating solution to diffuse completely and allows air bubbles to be easily trap - ped, thus forming voids and making poor electrical properties and adhesion of the plated fingers [21–23]. In this work, we propose innovatively a double-layer polysilicon structure consisting of a thick carbon (C)-free polysilicon and a thin C- doped polysilicon as the electron transport layer for the TOPCon SCs, in which the C-free polysilicon has high conductivity for carrier transport and the C-doped polysilicon has good wettability for plating the Ni seed layer. The experimental results confirm that the C-doped polysilicon shows good wettability with a super hydrophilic contact angle of about 0 � . As a result, the uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer was ob - tained, suggesting good physical contact between polysilicon films and metal electrodes. Moreover, the TOPCon lifetime sample with such a double-layer polysilicon design shows excellent passivation with the highest implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ) of 745 mV and good contact performance with a contact resistivity (  c ) of 2–3 m cm 2 . Finally, the proof-of-concept TOPCon SCs with the double-layer polysilicon struc - ture and Ni/Cu/Sn-plated electrodes achieve a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.18%, much higher than the C-free devices. 2.Experimental details 2.1.Preparation and characterization of the C-doped polysilicon The <100>oriented and 170   m thick n-type Czochralski (CZ) sili - con wafers with a resistivity of 0.8–2.1  cm were used as the substrates with the purpose of characterization. Both the front and rear surfaces of c-Si wafers were polished by TMAH. An ultrathin SiO x  layer was grown in a concentrated nitric-sulfuric (CNS) acid bath [24] at 60  � C for 10 min after standard RCA cleaning and HF dipping. Subsequently, a 5 nm thick C-doped amorphous silicon (n � ) layer was deposited on both sides of the c-Si substrate using a 13.56 MHz PECVD system with silane (SiH 4 ), phosphorane (PH 3 ), methane (CH 4 ), and hydrogen (H 2 ) as the reaction gases. The carbon content was controlled by the gas flow ratio (R) of CH 4 /(CH 4 �SiH 4 ). The samples were then annealed at 840  � C for 30 min in a quartz tube furnace in a moisture/nitrogen atmosphere [25]. The chemical composition of the C-doped polysilicon was characterized by XPS (AXIS ULTRA DLD). The surface wettability of the C-doped poly - silicon samples was characterized by measuring the water contact angle using a contact angle tester (OCA-20). 2.2.Preparation of the double-layer polysilicon structure and TOPCon device N-type phosphorus-doped CZ crystalline silicon wafers with a thickness of 205 �20   m and a resistivity of 1–7  cm were used for the preparation of solar cells. The front surface was textured by KOH solu - tion to construct the random pyramid structure. Then the boron emitter was prepared through the high-temperature diffusion of the BBr 3  source, and then the rear surface was polished with alkali to remove the sur - rounding deposition zone of boron diffusion. After RCA cleaning and HF dipping, a thin silicon oxide film with a thickness of 1.5 nm was grown on the rear side of the c-Si wafer by CNS acid at 60  � C for 10 min [24]. A 25–35 nm phosphorus-doped a-Si:H layer followed by a 5 nm C-doped a-Si:H layer with an R-value of 0.75 was deposited successively using the PECVD system. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 800 � C–860  � C for 30 min for amorphous silicon crystallization and dopant diffusion to form the TOPCon structure. The front side boron diffusion emitters were covered by AlO x /SiN x  stack by using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and PECVD, respectively. After defining the front electrode pattern by photolithography, the Ti/Pd/Ag seed layer was deposited by electron-beam evaporation and then it was thickened by plating. The pattern of the Ni/Cu/Sn electrode with a line width of 15   m on the rear side of the devices was defined using photolithography. Then, the Ni layer served as a seed layer, and a barrier layer for Cu was directly plated on the polysilicon film at a current density of 30 mA/cm 2  for 2 min. The Cu layer was subsequently deposited at 20 mA/cm 2  for 10 min. The Sn layer was electroless deposited in a 40  � C Sn electroless plating solution for 15 min to protect Cu from being oxidized. Ni and Cu plating solutions and Sn electroless plating solutions were provided by Atotech. Finally, a magnesium fluoride (MgF 2 ) passivation and anti-reflection layer was deposited on the front side by thermal evaporation. The sheet resistance (R sheet ) of the polysilicon films was measured by a four-point probe meter (Polytec, 4 Dimensions). The   c  between pol - ysilicon and plated grids was measured using a semiconductor param - eter analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS) combined with the transmission length method (TLM) [26]. The iV oc , single-sided saturation current density (J 0,s ), and effective minority carrier lifetime (  eff ) were extracted using a quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC, Sinton WCT-120). The photovoltaic performance of TOPCon SC was measured by a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5-3 A) under AM1.5 (100 mW/cm 2 ) irradiation at 25  � C, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and reflectance (Ref.) spectra of the devices were measured by an EQE system (Enlittech, QE-R3011). 3.Results and discussion The wettability of C-doped polysilicon films at the different R values was first investigated by measuring the contact angles of the distilled water droplets. For the C-free sample (i.e., R �0), the distilled water droplets were difficult to spread, suggesting a high surface tension in the C-free polysilicon film. As a result, a large contact angle of 84 �3 � was obtained as shown in Fig. 1(a). With the incorporation of C atoms, the wettability of the polysilicon films was significantly improved with the corresponding water contact angles decreasing as shown in Fig. 1(b)-1 (d). Notably, the polysilicon film with a relatively higher C content (i.e., R �0.75) exhibited super hydrophilicity with the water droplets completely spread on the surface. The wetting behavior of Ni electrolyte on the C-doped polysilicon was also measured, as shown in Fig. 1(e)-1 (h). As a result, the contact angles of the Ni electrolyte exhibit the same trend as the water, i.e., the contact angles of the Ni electrolyte are negatively correlated with the amount of C doping in the film, sug - gesting that C doping could effectively promote the diffusion of Ni electrolyte on the polysilicon. Therefore, it can be concluded from these observations that the introduction of C atoms into the polysilicon can effectively improve surface wettability. To uncover the improved wettability of the C-doped sample, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to examine the chemical states of the C-doped samples. The XPS spectra of C 1s are shown in Fig. 2, which can be split into three typical peaks corresponding to the C–Si (282.8 eV), C –– C (284.8 eV), and C–O–C (286.5 eV) bonds [27]. Compared to the C-free sample in Fig. 2(a), the intensity of C –– C and C–O–C bonds of the C-doped sample in Fig. 2(b)  H. Du et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       slightly increased. This indicates that only a small part of C –– C or C–O–C bonds were introduced by C doping, and most of the C –– C or C–O–C bonds originate from the contaminated carbon introduced from the testing environment. However, an additional XPS peak at 282.8 eV that can be assigned to C–Si bonds appears for the C-doped sample, sug - gesting that C tends to bond with polysilicon to form C–Si bonds. Compared to the nonpolar covalent Si–Si bonds, the C–Si bonds are highly polar, which may be the main reason for the better wettability of the C-doped polysilicon film [28]. The good wettability of the film could ensure the adequate spreading of the plating solution and reduce the surface energy which is conducive to the escape of hydrogen during the plating process to obtain a more uniform and dense seed layer. In this section, the physical morphology of Ni seed layers plated on the C-free and C-doped polysilicon films was characterized by optical and laser confocal microscopy, as shown in Fig. 3(c)-3(f). For the Ni seed layer formed on C-free polysilicon film, a considerable number of voids can be observed, which can be attributed to the non-uniform distribution of the plating solution and the trapping of hydrogen bubbles on the film during the plating process in Fig. 3(a) [21,23]. In contrast, the C-doped sample with better wettability allows the plating solution to spread more evenly and leads to a reduced surface tension, thus making it less susceptible to the retention of hydrogen bubbles on the surface as shown in Fig. 3(b). As a result, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer is formed on the C-doped polysilicon film as can be seen from Fig. 3(d) and (f). Our previous studies have shown that the presence of C severely degrades the conductivity of the polysilicon films [27], which will in turn affect the uniformity of the current distribution during plating. Herein, we propose a double-layer polysilicon structure as the electron transport layer of the TOPCon SCs, i.e., a C-free polysilicon layer covered by a thin C-doped polysilicon film, which could ensure good wettability and conductivity simultaneously. The following section will systemati - cally investigate the effect of deposition conditions and annealing tem - perature on the passivation and contact properties of such a structure. Here, it is worth noting that the introduction of C atoms into poly - silicon not only could improve surface wettability but also promote the quality of the polysilicon film. Previous works have confirmed that the presence of C could improve the physical contact of polysilicon/SiO x /c- Si structure by suppressing the blistering of polysilicon film during high- temperature annealing, maintaining high-quality H passivation by restraining H escape, regulating the diffusion profile of P dopant, and tailoring the energy alignment, which are all beneficial to promote the device performance [27,29–34]. Therefore, using the C-doped poly - silicon in this study will also benefit from the abovementioned advan - tages, and thus achieve the high-efficiency TOPCon SCs. In addition, the improved surface wettability of polysilicon demonstrated in this study also provides an effective way to address the film deposition for other polysilicon-based devices such as perovskite/TOPCon tandem SCs [35, 36]. The passivation quality of lifetime samples with the double-layer polysilicon structure under the different annealing temperatures was comprehensively evaluated, where the structure of the double-layer polysilicon lifetime samples is shown in Fig. 4(a). The passivation quality of the samples with double-layer structure shows the same change trend as that of the C-free polysilicon samples under the various annealing temperatures, which, however, is almost independent of R values as shown in Fig. 4(b)-4(d). This means that the passivation quality of such a structure has a high tolerance with the C content. Meanwhile, we can find that the lifetime samples with the different R values at 840  � C annealing show high-quality passivation with iV oc  values >740 mV, J 0,s  <4 fA/cm 2 , and the   eff  >3 ms at the injection level of 10 15  cm �3 . In particular, the best passivation with an iV oc  of 745 mV, a J 0,s  of 3 fA/cm 2 , and a   eff  of 4.6 ms is obtained under R �0.75 and 840  � C annealing. These results demonstrate that the double-layer pol - ysilicon structure can achieve excellent passivation quality. To further examine the electrical properties of the plated Ni/Cu/Sn grid and polysilicon film contact, the   c  was evaluated by the TLM. The dark I–V curves of the C-doped and double-layer samples with the different R values are plotted in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. Obvi - ously, all curves exhibit distinct Ohmic behavior, and the variation in the slope of the dark I–V curves of the double-layer structure is insen - sitive to the R values compared with the C-doped sample. It is worth  Fig. 1.Images of (a)–(d) a distilled water droplet and (e)–(h) a Ni electrolyte droplet for the samples without C-doping and with C-doping at an R-value of 0.5, 0.67, and 0.75.

Du et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       mentioning that although the C-doped samples with higher R values could achieve excellent passivation [27], the high resistivity of the C-doped film makes it difficult to be plated. By comparing the   c  of the C-doped and double-layer samples, as shown in Fig. 5(c), we can obtain the following conclusions. For the C-doped samples, the   c  shows an upward trend as the R increases from 0 to 0.67. This is due to that the presence of C suppresses the activation of P in the polysilicon film [27, 37], leading to a rise in the sheet resistance as shown in Fig. 5(d). In contrast, the double-layer samples show a relatively lower   c , which can be maintained at 2–3 m cm 2  even though the R-value is high enough (such as R �0.75). It is worth mentioning that sufficiently low   c  can be obtained based on the C-free samples as shown in Fig. 5(c), although there may be voids between the plated electrode and the C-free poly - silicon due to the poor surface wettability. We speculate that this may be due to the fact that the TLM pattern used in this work with a width of 1 mm is much higher than that of the voids with a size of tens of microns as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (e), these voids thus have less effect of the measured contact current. While grids for rear electrodes with a line width of about 15   m are compared to the size of voids, which may have a negative effect on the device performance. In summary, such a double-layer polysilicon structure shows not only better wettability but also low   c . Finally, the proof-of-concept n-type TOPCon SCs featuring the double-layer polysilicon structure and plated fingers were fabricated. The structure diagram is shown in Fig. 6(a) and the electrical parameters of TOPCon SCs are shown in Table 1. It can be seen from the J-V curves and the corresponding photovol - taic parameters in Fig. 6(b) that the device performance featuring the double-layer structure is significantly improved compared to that of the C-free device. Typically, the TOPCon SC with the double-layer structure delivers a remarkable PCE of 24.18%, with an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 707.3 mV, a short circuit current density (J sc ) of 42.03 mA/cm 2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 81.34%. In contrast, the C-free device shows a rela - tively poor PCE of 23.61%, a V oc  of 698.8 mV, a J sc  of 41.80 mA/cm 2 , and an FF of 80.85%. Here, we find that although the samples based on C-free polysilicon and double-layer structure exhibit the same level of passivation, as shown in Fig. 4, the final device based on the double- layer structure shows better performance. Metallization is well known to reduce the passivation performance of the device due to factors such as metal diffusion, while the polysilicon film for the device in this work is only 30 nm, which makes the V oc  more susceptible to metallization. It has been proven that C-doped polysilicon exhibits higher atomic density [37], which may have a better blocking effect on Cu atoms, thereby resulting in a small decrease in passivation performance. Besides, the improved FF may be attributed to the void-free fingers due to the better wettability of C-doped polysilicon. It is worth noting that we obtained a notably higher V oc  (i.e., 707.3 mV) by using the plating process to pre - pare the metal grids, which is much higher than our previous work (<700 mV) [27,38]. Here, we speculate that this may be due to less metallization damage by plating compared to thermal evaporation or  Fig. 3.(a)/(b) Photographs of the electroplating process, (c)/(d) optical microscopy photographs, and (e)/(f) images of the laser confocal microscopes of the plated Ni seed layer for the C-free/C-doped polysilicon samples.

The EQE and Ref. spectra of the devices featuring the double-layer structure and C-free polysilicon are shown in Fig. 6(c), which is consistent with the J-V curves in Fig. 6(b). In a word, the double-layer structure combined with the plated fingers can effec - tively improve the performance of TOPCon SCs. 4.Conclusion In this work, we proposed a double-layer polysilicon structure (i.e., C-doped/C-free polysilicon) for TOPCon SCs with the purpose of improving the wettability of the polysilicon films for plating the Ni seed layer while maintaining the contact performance of the plated grids with the polysilicon. Compared with the C-free polysilicon, the C-doped polysilicon shows better wettability, making it easier for hydrogen to release during electroplating. Therefore, a uniform, dense, and void-free Ni seed layer was obtained. By optimizing the deposition conditions and the annealing temperature, samples with the double-layer polysilicon structure show high passivation with a remarkable iV oc  of 745 mV. Benefiting from the double-layer polysilicon structure, a low   c  between the plated Ni/Cu/Sn grids and the double-layer structure with a value of 2–3 m cm 2  was achieved. Finally, the proof-of-concept TOPCon de - vices featuring such a double-layer structure were fabricated with a remarkable efficiency of 24.18%, demonstrating that the double-layer polysilicon structure combined with the plated metal fingers has considerable prospects for application in the manufacturing of high- efficiency TOPCon SCs.

Duan,2024,Insights into the Heat-Assisted Intensive Light-Soaking Effect on Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells,https://doi.org/10.1002/solr.202400383,Insights into the Heat‐Assisted Intensive Light‐Soaking Effect on Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells,"Heat-assisted intensive light soaking (LS) at 175 °C under ≈20 suns for 90 s improves the performance of SHJ solar cells by reducing series resistance. Approximately 44% of the improvement arises from enhanced vertical transport at the p-side due to the thermal effect, and ≈28% results from the illuminated n-side. The gain in Voc is explained by a decrease in the interface defect density between c–Si and a–Si:H (i), enhancing surface passivation.",Silicon Heterojunction (SHJ),Increased after LS (values before and after LS are shown in Figure 2),Increased after LS (values before and after LS are shown in Figure 2),Increased after LS (values before and after LS are shown in Figure 2),Increased after LS (values before and after LS are shown in Figure 2),Increased after LS (values before and after LS are shown in Figure 2),n-type silicon wafer (135 μm thick),Not reported,Not reported,a-Si:H,a-Si:H,Heterojunction,Heterojunction,Ag,Ag," InsightsintotheHeat-AssistedIntensiveLight-SoakingEffectonSiliconHeterojunctionSolarCellsWeiyuanDuan,*TobiasRudolph,HabtamuTsegayeGebrewold,KarstenBittkau,AndreasLambertz,DepengQiu,MuhammadAinulYaqin,XixiangXu,KainingDing,*andUweRau*1.IntroductionSiliconheterojunction(SHJ)solarcellscur-rentlyexhibitthehighestefciencyamongsilicon-baseddevices.Thecellefciencyhassteadilyimprovedinrecentyearsandreached26.8%forthetwosidescontactedstructureasreportedbyLongi.[1]Duetoitslow-temperatureprocesses,low-temperaturecoefcient,andhighbifacial-ity,SHJsolarcelltechnologyisconsideredpromisingforlarge-scaleterrestrialPVapplications.[2–4]Theincreasingcommer-cialinterestinSHJsolarcellshasinspiredresearchinfurtherincreasingthepowerconversionefciencyandunderstandingtheunderlyingcausalmechanisms.Intrinsicanddopedhydrogenatedamor-phoussilicon(a–Si:H)layersareusedforsurfacepassivationandcarrierselectivity,whicharethekeymaterialsinSHJsolarcellsforachievinghighopen-circuitvoltage(VOC)andgoodcarrierselectivity.[5]DiscoveredbyStaeblerandWronskiin1977,exposuretolightcanincreasethedefectdensityina–Si:H,resultinginperformancedegradationinthin-lmsolarcells.[6,7]ThiseffectraisesconcernswhetherSHJsolarcellsfab-ricatedwithultrathina–Si:Hlayersarestableunderprolongedlightexposure.Fortunately,in2016,Kobayashietal.reportedanenhancedlight-inducedperformanceofSHJsolarcellsunder1sunillumination,whichwasattributedtoareduceddensityofrecombination-activeinterfacestates,leadingtoanimprovementinVOCandllfactor(FF).[8]Theseauthorsalsoshowedsimilarkineticsbyapplyingadarkforward-voltagebias,whereanincreaseinminoritycarrierinjectionintheabsorberwouldbegenerated,whichcouldcontributetonear-interfacestatehealing.[9,10]Multiplesubsequentpublicationsutilizingdifferentlight-soaking(LS)techniqueshavealsorevealedimprovementsintheefciencyofSHJsolarcells.TheseenhancementsstemfromsystematicimprovementsintheVOCandFF,aswellassig-nicantreductionsinseriesresistance(RS).[11,12]Light-inducedperformanceenhancementhasbeenobservedatthemodulelevelbyseveralresearchgroups,inadditiontocell-leveleffects.[13,14]WhilesomepublicationshighlightthebenetsofLS,therearealsoreportsindicatingharmfulilluminationeffects.Wrightetal.demonstratedanotabledeclineintheefciencyofcommercialn-typeSHJsolarcellswhensubjectedtoannealing W.Duan,T.Rudolph,H.T.Gebrewold,K.Bittkau,A.Lambertz,D.Qiu,M.A.Yaqin,K.Ding,U.RauIEK-5PhotovoltaikForschungszentrumJülichGmbH52428Jülich,GermanyE-mail:w.duan@fz-juelich.de;k.ding@fz-juelich.de;u.rau@fz-juelich.deT.Rudolph,H.T.Gebrewold,D.Qiu,M.A.Yaqin,U.RauJülichAachenResearchAlliance(JARA-Energy)andFacultyofElectricalEngineeringandInformationTechnologyRWTHAachenUniversity52062Aachen,GermanyX.XuLONGiCentralR&DInstituteLongiGreenEnergyTechnologyCo.,Ltd.Xi’an710018,China TheORCIDidenticationnumber(s)fortheauthor(s)ofthisarticlecanbefoundunderhttps://doi.org/10.1002/solr.202400383.©2024TheAuthor(s).SolarRRLpublishedbyWiley-VCHGmbH.ThisisanopenaccessarticleunderthetermsoftheCreativeCommonsAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivsLicense,whichpermitsuseanddistributioninanymedium,providedtheoriginalworkisproperlycited,theuseisnon-commercialandnomodicationsoradaptationsaremade.DOI:10.1002/solr.202400383 Heat-assistedintensivelightsoakinghasbeenproposedasaneffectivepost-treatmenttofurtherenhancetheperformanceofsiliconheterojunction(SHJ)solarcells.Inthecurrentstudy,itisaimedtodistinguishtheeffectsofheatandilluminationondifferent(dopedandundoped)layersoftheSHJcontactstack.Itisdiscoveredthatbothelevatedtemperatureandilluminationarenecessarytosignicantlyreduceinterfacerecombinationwhenworkingeffectivelytogether.Thesynergisticeffectonpassivationdisplaysathermalactivationenergyofapproximately0.5eV.Thisislikelyduetothephotogeneratedelectron/holepairsinthec–Siwafer,wherenearlyalloftheincidentlightisabsorbed.Bydistin-guishingbetweentheeffectsoflightandheateffectsontheconductivityofp-andn-typedopedhydrogenatedamorphoussilicon(a–Si:H)layers,itisdemonstratedthatonlyheatisaccountablefortheobservedriseinconductivity.Accordingtonumericaldevicesimulations,thesignicantcontributiontotheopen-circuitvoltageenhancementarisesfromthereduceddensityofdefectstatesatthec–Si/intrinsica–Si:Hinterface.Inaddition,theevolutionofthellfactorishighlydependentonchangesininterfacedefectdensityandthebandtailstatedensityofp-typea–Si:H.

In situ doped poly-Si films are studied as their use could simplify the production of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells compared to the common approach relying on ex situ doping of intrinsic LPCVD poly-Si films. The developed poly-Si passivating contacts exhibited excellent characteristics with low recombination current densities in passivated and screen-printing metallized regions down to 2.3 fA/cm 2  and 65.8 fA/cm 2 , respectively, and a low contact resistivity of 2.0 mcm 2 . For reaching the best passivating contact characteristics and high solar cell efficiencies, a poly-Si film thickness of 150–200 nm was found to be optimal while a polished rear surface morphology was found to be beneficial. The best solar cell reached a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.01% along with a high open circuit voltage of 691.7 mV, enabled by the passivating contacts with the in situ doped poly-Si films. 1-cell glass-glass laminates were also fabricated with the developed solar cells, which showed no loss in their power output both upon 400 thermal cycles and after 1000 h of damp heat testing. Lastly, a roadmap is presented, indicating strategies to achieve efficiencies up to 25.5% with n-TOPCon solar cells incorporating the in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films.    1.Introduction In recent years, n-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (n-TOPCon) solar cells have found increased interest and market share in the field of photovoltaics (PV) [1]. The appeal of n-TOPCon solar cells is in the incorporation of rear passivating contacts consisting of n-type poly - crystalline silicon (poly-Si) and interfacial SiO x  films, which provide low recombination current density (J 0 ) and contact resistivity (  c ) simulta - neously [2]. The potential of the n-TOPCon technology has already been demonstrated by the achievement of a record power conversion effi - ciency (  ) of 25.8% with a lab-type small-area solar cell [3], impressive    up to 25.4% with large-area solar cells [4–6], and a high average    exceeding 24% in production [7,8]. In the PV community, a vast body of research has been devoted to the development and device integration of poly-Si passivating contacts, based on various fabrication techniques [2,9,10]. For the fabrication of the poly-Si films used in industrial n-TOPCon solar cells, low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) has been the primary choice so far [1]. The PV industry has favored this technique because of its high throughput and since LPCVD equipment offers the possibility of ther - mally growing the interfacial SiO x  film in situ [2]. While the latter feature allows process simplification by combining the deposition of the SiO x  and the Si, deposited either as poly-Si or as amorphous Si (a-Si), layers in a single step, current LPCVD-based approaches in the PV in - dustry still do not exploit the full potential of this technique in terms of process simplicity. This is because the necessary phosphorus (P) doping  *Corresponding author. KU Leuven, Department of Electrical Engineering, Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, 3001, Leuven, Belgium.

By contrast, an alter - native approach based on in situ doping can allow producing the entire passivating contact in a single step, offering the possibility of leaner fabrication. Device integration of poly-Si passivating contacts fabricated by the standard industrial approach based on LPCVD and ex situ P-doping has been the focus of a plethora of studies [2,5,10,11]. As a result, the impact of various n-TOPCon solar cell design parameters on the ex situ doped passivating contact and device properties has already been investigated. The studied parameters include the method used for growing the interfacial SiO x  film [12], the structural properties of the poly-Si film [13], the poly-Si film thickness (t poly ) [14,15], and the composition of the screen-printing paste used for the metallization of the passivating contact [16]. Related to the alternative approach for the fabrication of poly-Si films based on LPCVD and in situ P-doping, various studies are present in the literature, which provide valuable insights into the impact of LPCVD process parameters on structural and electrical properties of poly-Si films [17–22]. Nevertheless, the applications considered in these studies are mainly not associated with PV. In fact, the number of publications on the fabrication of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films has been limited due to challenges arising from combining LPCVD with in situ P-doping, which has made ex situ doping the preference of the PV industry so far [23–25]. The main challenge is to achieve a high active doping level (N D, act ) in the deposited Si film, which is needed for obtaining low J 0  and   c , together with a high deposition rate (r dep ) and thus throughput, as P-containing precursors slow down the Si film growth [17]. A process offering an optimized trade-off between these parameters has recently been developed by our group, which achieves the deposi - tion of Si films, in polycrystalline form, with a high N D,act  of 1.310 20  cm �3  and an r dep  of 0.078 nm/s [26]. This represents a ~53% drop in r dep  with respect to the LPCVD of intrinsic Si at the same temperature (590  ◦ C), which corresponds to an increase of the time required for the deposition of a typical 150 nm thick Si film by only ~17 min, from ~15 min for the growth of intrinsic poly-Si to ~32 min in case of in situ doping [26]. Moreover, by combining the poly-Si films developed in our previous work with thermally grown interfacial SiO x  layers and applying post-LPCVD annealing, excellent passivating contacts were fabricated with J 0  down to 1.5 fA/cm 2  and   c  down to 1.8 mcm 2  [26]. The po - tential of these passivating contacts is assessed in this work at device level. It is important to note that the use of thermal annealing, which is considered necessary for the activation of dopants and commonly applied to in situ doped Si films [2], makes the in situ doping-based approach a two-step process itself as in the case of ex situ doping by dopant diffusion. However, it has been shown in the literature that, while the deposition of in situ doped Si films is more expensive than their intrinsic counterparts due to the reduced r dep  in case of in situ doping, the overall cost of n-TOPCon solar cells incorporating in situ doped poly-Si passivating contacts can be lower by 0.2 $cents per Watt peak than the devices with conventional ex situ doped passivating contacts, if the annealing in case of in situ doping can be optimized to yield a shorter and leaner process [17,27]. Moreover, a simpler single-step process may still be achieved in case of in situ doping either by developing LPCVD equipment which can perform the annealing also in situ, or by means of the fired passivating contact concept, which eliminates the annealing and relies on the firing step used for screen-printed metallization also for the activation of dopants in the Si film [28]. However, these de - velopments are beyond the scope of this work. This paper reports on the integration of passivating contacts based on in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD at the rear side of large-area bifacial n-TOPCon solar cells. The devices were fabricated relying on industrial methods, using a homogeneous boron-diffused front emitter and screen-printed metallization. Impact of t poly  on the passivating contact and the solar cell properties is presented. Moreover, perfor - mance of the passivating contacts and the solar cells are reported for two types of rear surface morphologies: semi-textured and polished. The paper also reports on the suitability of the developed solar cells for application in PV modules by means of thermal cycling and damp heat tests. In addition, a roadmap is provided which shows how the efficiency of n-TOPCon solar cells featuring in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD can be further improved starting from the baseline established in this work. 2.Materials and methods 2.1.Integration of in situ doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts in n- TOPCon solar cells The in situ P-doped LPCVD-based poly-Si films developed in Ref. [26] were integrated in n-TOPCon solar cells in two sets of experiments. The goal of the first experiment was to study the impact of t poly  on the solar cell performance and identify the optimal t poly  value. This experiment is referred to as the t poly  screening experiment. For this purpose, solar cells with a large area of 241.3 cm 2  were prepared using n-type Cz wafers with the structure illustrated in Fig. 1a), following the process flow in Fig. 1b). After random pyramid texturing and cleaning, a ~1   m-deep homogeneous p-type emitter with a sheet resistance of 110 / was realized by BBr 3  diffusion, followed by the removal of the borosilicate glass (BSG) in a solution containing diluted hydrofluoric acid (HF). The boron-diffused layer was later removed from the rear side by the so-called emitter removal process using a mixture of 49% HF, 70% nitric acid (HNO 3 ), and concentrated sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), with volume concentrations of 6.2%, 36.0%, and 21.4%, respectively, in the mixture diluted in water [29]. This is a single-side etching process performed in a Rena inline processing equipment with the wafers moving at 8  ◦ C on closely spaced rollers with a speed of 1.5 m/min over etch baths over - flown with the aforementioned chemistry. The process consists of two passes of each wafer through the equipment, leading to the removal of ~1.5–2   m of Si from the rear determined by weight measurements, resulting in a semi-textured surface morphology with slightly rounded-off pyramids. The fabrication continued with the realization of the poly-Si passivating contact on the rear. For this, first, the front side was masked with a 200 nm thick SiO x  mask grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in a batch-type system. Later, the interfacial SiO x  layer of the passivating contact structure was grown thermally, yielding a thickness of ~1.5 nm measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on identically oxidized thickness monitors. We would like to note that the monitors had been annealed by the same process as the solar cells prior to the TEM measurements. Following the oxidation, the in situ P-doped poly-Si film was deposited by LPCVD in a single-wafer ASM Epsilon 2000 reactor, using the process reported in Ref. [26]. The split of the t poly  screening experiment was introduced at this step by varying the deposition duration, which resulted in three different t poly  values: 100 nm, 150 nm, and 200 nm. For each one of these thicknesses, a group of 8 solar cells was prepared. The t poly  values were confirmed for each split by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) mea - surements on identically processed thickness monitors. As for the oxide thickness monitors, the t poly  monitors had also undergone the same annealing process as the solar cells before the thickness measurements. As the LPCVD process creates a wrap-around of poly-Si at the front surface, this parasitic layer was removed by a single-side dry etch pro - cess in NF 3  plasma, followed by the removal of the SiO x  mask in HF. The reader should note that, while dry etching was used in this work, wrap- around removal can also be performed by the simpler and more common approach based on single-side wet-chemical etching of poly-Si in a diluted alkaline solution, eliminating the masking step [12,30,31]. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 900  ◦ C for 60 min [26]. Afterwards, the front surface was passivated with 5 nm thick atomic  M. Fırat et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     layer deposited (ALD) AlO x  and 70 nm thick PECVD SiN x :H films, the latter of which also acts as an antireflection coating (ARC). A 70 nm thick PECVD SiN x :H film was also applied to the rear side for improving the passivation quality provided by the passivating contact by means of hydrogenation. Fabrication of the solar cells was then completed by metallization using a zero-busbar design on both sides, leading to bifa - cial solar cells. The metallization fraction of the front and rear surfaces of the solar cells was 2.7% and 5%, respectively. For metallization, Ag and Ag/Al pastes were screen-printed at the rear and front sides, respectively, followed by firing of the pastes through the SiN x :H films for realizing contacts with the poly-Si and the emitter. Firing was performed with a belt speed of 150 inches per minute and a set peak temperature of 855  ◦ C. The focus of the second experiment was to investigate the impact of the rear surface morphology on the n-TOPCon solar cells. This experi - ment is referred to as the rear surface morphology screening experiment. For this, a reference group of 7 solar cells was prepared with the same design and process as for the t poly  screening experiment i.e., the rear surface morphology was semi-textured. For this reference group, a single t poly  value of 150 nm was chosen. In addition, another group of 14 solar cells was fabricated, also with t poly  =150 nm but a polished rear surface morphology. The design of these solar cells is also the one depicted in Fig. 1a) and the fabrication followed the process flow in Fig. 1b), with the only difference to the reference group being the strength of the single-side etch used for removing the boron-diffused emitter from the rear side. Instead of the emitter removal process, a polishing process was applied to these solar cells using the same equipment as for emitter removal but a more concentrated HF/HNO 3  mixture. In more detail, the volume concentrations of 49% HF and 70% HNO 3  in the polishing so - lution were 20% and 80%, respectively. The wafer speed was 1.5 m/ min, identical to the emitter removal process, but the process temper - ature was slightly higher, at 12  ◦ C. The polishing process was applied a single time to each wafer, which removes ~6   m of Si and yields a flatter rear surface, which, however, does not correspond to a mirror-polished surface but exhibits significant roughness [29]. Moreover, on four of the best solar cells of the rear surface morphology screening experiment, selected from the group with the polished rear surface, an additional 90 nm thick SiO x  layer was deposited by PECVD (in a single-wafer system unlike the previous PECVD steps) on top of the front SiN x :H film and the metal grid to create a double ARC (DARC) and to further reduce the front reflectance [32,33]. The solar cells of both experiments were characterized by current- voltage (I–V) measurements under 1 sun illumination with the AM1.5 G spectrum using a Wacom solar simulator and a GridTouch system by Pasan to contact the zero-busbar devices. These measurements were performed both with front and rear illumination. In case of the solar cells with a DARC, I–V measurements were repeated after the realization of the DARC, and the best solar cell was also sent to ISFH CalTeC for a calibrated I–V measurement. From the I–V measurements with front illumination, the open circuit voltage (V oc ), the short circuit current density (J sc ), the fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (  ) of the solar cells were extracted. Moreover, the    values obtained with front and rear illumination were used for determining the bifaciality of the solar cells as the ratio of the rear and front   . Furthermore, the I–V measurements with front illumination were repeated with the illumi - nation intensity reduced to 7% of 1 sun. The resulting data and the data acquired under 1 sun front illumination were used together for deter - mining the ideality factor (n) and the area-normalized series resistance (r s ) by the Bowden method [34]. In addition, to gain insight into the FF losses, FF values without the impact of r s  (FF n ) and without the impact of both r s  and non-ideal n (FF 0 ) were calculated [34]. The solar cells were further inspected by optical microscopy to assess the quality of the screen-printed contacts. Moreover, the reflectance (R) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured under front illumination at a 2 cm ×2 cm spot on the solar cell in the wavelength () range of 280–1200 nm using a LOANA system by PV-tools with a black chuck. For the EQE measurements, a bias light of 0.3 suns was used. The EQE data was corrected by a wavelength- independent scaling factor so that its integration with the AM1.5 G spectrum yields the J sc  determined by the I–V measurements. These data were analyzed for understanding the differences in the optical perfor - mance of each group of solar cells. For understanding the factors limiting the performance of the n- TOPCon solar cells, symmetrically passivated monitor samples were also prepared together with the devices. These rear and front monitors, depicted schematically in Fig. 2a) and 2b), respectively, were designed to reproduce either the rear or the front side of the devices, allowing the passivation and contact properties of each surface to be independently investigated. As the rear surface design was varied during the experi - ments, a set of two rear monitors was fabricated for each t poly  and rear surface morphology studied. By contrast, the front surface remained the same in all experiments, thus only two front monitors were prepared. Fabrication of the monitors followed the relevant steps in the process flow shown in Fig. 1b). On the monitors, the metal fingers were screen- printed only on some regions and with varying metallization fraction, while other regions were left non-metallized [26]. Passivation properties of both surfaces were investigated by per - forming minority carrier lifetime (  ) measurements on the passivated regions of the respective monitors by the transient decay method, using a BT Imaging equipment. From the resulting injection level (n) dependent lifetime data, J 0  of the passivated regions (J 0,p ) at n =10 16  cm �3  was extracted. Photoluminescence (PL) images of the monitors were also taken using the same BT Imaging equipment, revealing the passivation quality in metallized regions in terms of PL counts. Based on these counts, the findings of the lifetime measurements, and the method described in Ref. [35], J 0  of the metallized regions (J 0,m ) was also  Fig. 1.a) Schematic (not drawn to scale) of the large-area bifacial n-TOPCon solar cells with a homogeneous diffused front emitter and screen-printed contacts. b) Process flow followed for fabricating the solar cells in a).

Fırat et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     determined. Furthermore, structures containing fingers with a pitch of 2 mm, and dimensions of 1 cm by ~50   m were laser-diced from the monitor samples for measuring   c  by the transfer length method (TLM). In the following sections, each of these parameters are reported with an extra index “r” or “f” to indicate that these belong to the rear or the front surface, respectively. 2.2.Damp heat and thermal cycling tests on 1-cell n-TOPCon solar laminates 1-cell laminates of the n-TOPCon solar cells with a t poly  of 150 nm and polished rear surface were fabricated in a glass-glass configuration, using SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT) foils by Meyer Burger [36], PO8110 encapsulant by 3 M, and glass without ARC. To contact the wires, Sn 0965 Ag 0.035 -coated Cu ribbons with a width of 5 mm and a thickness of 0.3 mm were placed in contact with the SWCT foils. Sub - sequently, a 20 min-long lamination was performed at 150  ◦ C, while applying a pressure of 700 mbar onto the assembled structure. The laminates were investigated both by damp heat and thermal cycling tests. For the damp heat test, a laminate was exposed to 85  ◦ C and a relative humidity of 85% for 1000 h. Another laminate was sub - jected to the thermal cycling test, which took the sample repeatedly between �40  ◦ C and 85  ◦ C for 400 cycles with a cycle duration of 3 h and a dwell time of 10 min at both temperatures. No current was applied to the laminates during thermal cycling. The laminates were characterized by light I–V measurements under 1 sun front illumination using the LOANA system, yielding the V oc , J sc , FF,   , and the output power (P out ) of the laminates. The measurements were performed before and after the damp heat and thermal cycling tests, and in case of thermal cycling also after every 100 cycles. The evolution of P out  during the tests was assessed to determine whether the laminates of the n-TOPCon solar cells pass the damp heat and thermal cycling tests by exhibiting a P out  loss ≤5% for a single IEC61215 test. 2.3.Roadmap for improving the n-TOPCon solar cells To establish a roadmap indicating experimental strategies to improve the efficiency of the n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD-based poly-Si passivating contacts, simulations were performed using the Quokka 2 software [37]. First, a model was built to match the I–V parameters of the best solar cell with a t poly  of 150 nm, polished rear surface, and single ARC. The corresponding input parameters of this model are listed in Table 1. These values were selected based on experimental data, in case of e.g., J 0,E  and contact resistivity, and design parameters, in case of e.g., contact half widths, whenever available, and were otherwise chosen reasonably in order to match the I–V parameters of the best solar cell. For the input parameters not listed in Table 1, the defaults of the Quokka settings file generator were used. The remaining simulations were organized in 8 steps to establish the roadmap by improving or optimizing several solar cell parameters. These were (i) the bulk lifetime (  B ), (ii) the bulk resistivity (  B ) and the contact resistivities (  c,f ,   c,r ) (iii) the screen-printed finger widths (w f , w r ) and pitches (p f , p r ), (iv) t poly , (v) reflectance R by the use of DARC, (vi) the passivation of the non-contacted regions of the front side by the use of an advanced emitter, (vii) the passivation of the contacted regions of the front side by the use of a selective emitter, and (viii) again the front surface passivation in non-contacted regions using a transparent passivating contact. The Quokka 2 input parameters varied in each step are listed in Table 2. It is important to note that in each step the optimum values determined in preceding steps were used.

While the best solar cell has an    of 22.4% along with a relatively high FF of 81.1%, this seems to be an outlier as the best average    lies just below 22%, accompanied by significantly lower average FF values of 79.4% and below. Comparison of the average    as a function of t poly  shows that solar cells with thicker poly-Si films are more efficient, with a significant jump of 0.4% in    for t poly  increasing from 100 to 150 nm, but only a 0.1% improvement when t poly  is further raised to 200 nm. Differences between the other parameters of the three solar cell groups reveal two opposite trends with increasing t poly , which explain the nonlinear improvement of the average   : (i) J sc  drops by ~0.15 mA/cm 2  per 50 nm increase in t poly , and (ii) V oc  and FF improve, particularly when t poly  is raised from 100 to 150 nm. The loss in J sc  with higher t poly  is attributed to increased parasitic absorption in the heavily doped poly-Si film, mainly due to free carrier absorption (FCA). Our previous optical studies predict a linearly increasing J sc  loss as a function of t poly  when the poly-Si passivating contact is integrated at the rear side of solar cells as in this work, with the loss equal to ~0.2 mA/cm 2  per 50 nm increase in t poly  [26,38]. Studies by other groups in the literature also predict similar FCA-related losses between 0.1 and 0.25 mA/cm 2  per 50 nm increase in t poly  [12,15, 39]. Hence, the behavior of J sc  in Table 3 as a function of t poly  can be explained with the parasitic absorption losses reported in the literature. To verify this hypothesis, R and EQE measurements were performed, yielding the results in Fig. 3. The plot on the left shows that the solar cells with different t poly  have very similar optical properties at short and visible wavelengths, while R seems to decrease with increasing t poly  at long wavelengths, attributed to increased absorption in the poly-Si at the solar cell rear. The impact of higher t poly  on EQE and thus on J sc  is more clearly seen in the second, zoomed-in plot, which indicates a clear drop in the wavelength range of 1000–1200 nm. These findings agree well with the results of similar studies in the literature based on EQE mea - surements [15,39]. Since the optical differences are at long wavelengths i.e., concerned with photons reaching the rear side of the solar cells, and depend systematically on t poly , the data show that FCA in the poly-Si films is indeed the reason behind the J sc  loss with increasing t poly . In addition, the impact of parasitic absorption in the poly-Si films on the optical performance of solar cells is also evident from the bifaciality values of each solar cell group, measured as 82.1 Σ0.5%, 80.2 Σ0.6%, and 78.0 Σ0.3%, for t poly  of 100, 150, and 200 nm, respectively. This is expected, since the parasitic absorption in the poly-Si at the illuminated side of the solar cell is known to increase with t poly  and also to be significantly greater than the absorption in a poly-Si film at the non- illuminated side for the same t poly  [40]. To understand the increasing trend of FF in Table 3 with t poly , an FF loss analysis was performed, yielding the results in Fig. 4a). First, it is evident from these data that the difference between FF n  and FF i.e., the loss due to series resistance of the solar cells, is significantly larger than the difference between FF 0  and FF n  i.e., the loss due to recombination. This is expected given the relatively high r s  of 0.8 cm 2  of the solar cells, which is attributed to issues during the screen-printing process mainly due to the use of aged Ag paste, resulting in quite regularly spaced finger interruptions at intervals of a few 100 nm as shown by the microscopy image in Fig. 4b). Poor quality of the metallization being the limiting factor for the FF is also demonstrated by the performance of the best solar cell, on which little to no finger interruptions were found. As a result, the best solar cell has a significantly lower r s  of 0.5 cm 2  and a higher FF of 81.1%. Despite r s -related losses being the dominant mechanism, these cannot explain the FF trend observed, since r s  is similar for all groups of solar cells. Instead, the behavior of FF with t poly  seems to follow that of the FF n . This suggests that the FF trend and particularly the ~1% FF improvement for a t poly  increase from 100 to 150 nm arise from enhanced mitigation of recombination losses, yielding a lower n value (see Table 3) and therefore an improvement in FF n . The positive impact of using a t poly  of 150 nm or higher in mitigating recombination losses was verified by characterizing the symmetrically passivated monitors. The results, depicted in Fig. 5a), show that J 0,m,r  decreases by more than a factor of 5, to values below 100 fA/cm 2 , when t poly  is increased from 100 to 150 nm, showing that passivating contacts with thicker poly-Si films preserve their carrier selectivity better against aggressive screen-printed metallization. This observation agrees with the findings of similar studies in the literature [14,15,41–43]. Moreover, according to Fig. 5a), J 0,p,r  decreases slightly, to 3.6 fA/cm 2 , for higher t poly , which agrees with the trend reported in some works in the litera - ture [14,15], while other works did not identify any trend in J 0,p,r  as a function of t poly  [41,43]. Overall, the reduction in J 0,m,r  and J 0,p,r  with increasing t poly  indicate that the use of thicker poly-Si films lead to lower recombination losses. Both the ~1% higher FF n  and FF, and the ~10 mV higher V oc  for t poly  ˘150 nm are attributed to enhanced mitigation of recombination in case of thicker poly-Si. Another benefit of using higher t poly  is the achievement of lower   c,r , down to 1.7 mcm 2 , as Fig. 5b) shows. As for J 0,p,r , the decrease in   c,r  with increasing t poly  agrees with some [14,15,43], but not all results in the literature [41]. Comparison of all these findings regarding the impact of t poly  on poly-Si passivating contact properties, obtained here on semi-textured surfaces, with the corresponding results on textured surfaces reported in our previous work indicates a good agreement [26]. Despite the reproducibility of the results, it is not well-understood why J 0,p,r  and   c,r  are lower for higher t poly . This calls for a more detailed study on the impact of t poly  on the poly-Si film properties such as the doping profile, which is beyond the scope of this work and will be targeted in the future. In addition to the properties of the passivating contact at the rear, Fig. 5 reveals for the front surface that a low   c,f  �2.1 mcm 2  can be achieved, but with a poor passivation quality as indicated by the high J 0, p,f  �21.3 fA/cm 2  and J 0,m,f  �632.2 fA/cm 2 . This is expected given the lack of passivating contacts at the front side and appears to be the main factor limiting the V oc  of the solar cells. This finding agrees with the results of similar recombination loss analyses reported in the literature for n-TOPCon solar cells [5,16]. Overall, these results show that a thick enough poly-Si film with t poly  ˘150 nm is necessary to achieve high-quality passivating contacts and high-efficiency n-TOPCon solar cells for the screen-printed contacts used. While choosing t poly  ⊤150 nm results in slightly improved elec - trical properties of the devices, it also leads to optical losses, showing only marginal improvements in terms of   . It is expected that, for t poly  beyond 200 nm,    might drop due to increased J sc  losses, which might limit the solar cell performance, as shown in the literature [15]. For these reasons, 150 nm was chosen as the poly-Si thickness for the rear surface morphology screening experiment in this work. Apart from the  Table 3 I–V parameters of n-TOPCon solar cells with semi-textured rear surface and varying poly-Si thicknesses in the passivating contacts at the rear.

Therefore, new bottles of screen-printing pastes and new screens adapted to the wafer size were used for the rear surface morphology screening experiment. 3.2.Impact of rear surface morphology on n-TOPCon solar cells For studying the impact of the rear surface morphology on the solar cell characteristics, n-TOPCon solar cells with semi-textured and pol - ished rear surfaces were prepared.

M. Fırat et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     are illustrated in the SEM images shown in Fig. 6a), 6b), and 6c), respectively. Findings of the I–V characterization of n-TOPCon solar cells with t poly  =150 nm and the semi-textured and polished rear surface morphologies are shown in Table 4. First, comparison of the semi- textured reference group with the corresponding results in Table 3 for t poly  =150 nm shows that the average    has slightly improved by 0.1%. This is due to the 0.7% jump in FF, which follows from the lower r s  of 0.6 cm 2 , and is attributed to the improved screen-printing process, yielding little to no finger interruptions as found by optical microscopy. The reason for the limited gain in    despite this significant FF increase seems to be the drop in V oc  by 2.4 mV. To understand this loss in V oc , PL images of monitor samples from the t poly  screening and rear surface morphology screening experiments were compared. The design of the monitors with regions of different metallization fractions (MF) is depicted in Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 7b), the non-metallized regions of the monitor from the t poly  screening experiment are uniformly passiv - ated, while the monitor from the rear surface morphology screening experiment, depicted in Fig. 7c), has lower PL counts i.e., darker regions at the edges. This is attributed to unexpected contamination of the edges, found to be originating from the boat of the PECVD equipment used. By contrast, the darker color in the metallized regions is expected due to elevated recombination because of metallization, which clearly increases with higher MF in Fig. 7b) and 7c). Table 4 also reveals that the flatter rear surface morphology resulting from polishing allows the fabrication of n-TOPCon solar cells which are 0.4% more efficient on average. While minor improvements are observed in V oc  and FF of the solar cells with polished rear, the main reason behind the efficiency gain is clearly the 0.5 mA/cm 2  increase in J sc . Results of R and EQE measurements performed on solar cells with different rear surface morphology, depicted in Fig. 8a), reveal that the optical improvement originates from a gain in EQE at long wavelengths. This leads to the conclusion that the polished rear surface offers enhanced light trapping compared to the semi-textured one, which also explains the higher R at long wavelengths, as more light is internally reflected at the polished rear, increasing the escape reflectance. It is important to note, however, that the use of the polished rear surface also reduces the bifaciality from 81.2 ±0.3%, in the case of the semi-textured rear, to 78.7 ±0.5%. This is because of the J sc  under rear illumination decreasing by 0.8 mA/cm 2  due to an increased R in the case of the polished rear surface. The impact of this drop in bifaciality on the energy yield at the PV system level requires further investigation, which is beyond the scope of this work. Concerning the impact of rear surface morphology on the FF, the analysis in Fig. 8b) shows that the dominant loss mechanism remains r s - related for both morphologies as in Fig. 4a), albeit with a lower drop from FF n  to FF than in the t poly  screening experiment, given the lower r s  in Table 4 than in Table 3. Furthermore, the minor improvement in FF for the solar cells with polished rear follows from the increase in FF n  by the same margin of 0.2% i.e., from enhanced mitigation of recombina - tion losses. This conclusion is supported by the ~45% lower J 0,p,r  of 2.3 fA/cm 2  and J 0,m,r  of 65.8 fA/cm 2  found for the polished monitors, as depicted in Fig. 9a). This finding agrees with the results in the literature [5]. The observed reduction in recombination losses also explains the 1.2 mV increase in V oc  of the solar cells with polished rear surface. Achievement of lower J 0,p,r  and J 0,m,r  on the flatter polished surface is attributed to three factors based on the literature: (i) the reduced surface area compared to the semi-textured surface, (ii) the lower dangling bond density of (100)-oriented surfaces than the (111)-oriented facets, with the former and the latter exposed to a greater extent in case of the polished and semi-textured surfaces, respectively, and (iii) the reduction in stress related defects in the SiO x  film [44]. Moreover, Fig. 9b) shows that   c,r  decreases from 2.5 mcm 2  in case of the semi-textured surface to 2.0 mcm 2  when the surface is polished, which is surprising as a higher contact resistivity would be expected due to the lower contact area. The reason behind this   c,r  reduction is not well-understood and given the relatively high standard deviation of 0.3 mcm 2  of the   c,r  data in case of the polished surface, the observed drop should be treated with caution and might be inconclusive. The findings of the solar cell development thus reveal that the use of a sufficiently thick poly-Si film and a polished rear surface morphology are key for enabling high efficiencies. For further increasing the   , two strategies seem plausible: (i) reducing the total J 0  and thus improving the V oc  of the devices by enhancing the passivation of the front surface and by passivating the front contacts as the high J 0,p,f  and J 0,m,f  in Fig. 5 suggest, and (ii) improving the relatively low EQE of the devices at short wavelengths, as Fig. 8a) shows. While the former is challenging to achieve with industrial processes, the latter is feasible by realizing a DARC at the front surface, which was chosen as the final step of improvement in this work. 3.3.Impact of using DARC on n-TOPCon solar cells Table 5 shows the improvement achieved by using the DARC con - sisting of a stack of 70 nm SiN x  and 90 nm SiO x  films on four of the best solar cells with polished rear surface. First, the best solar cell with a certified    of 23.01% and a high V oc  of 691.7 mV (see Fig. 10), fabricated with the industrial process in Fig. 1b), clearly demonstrates the potential of passivating contacts with in situ P-doped poly-Si films deposited by LPCVD. This result matches the highest    obtained in the literature with a large-area n-TOPCon solar cell incorporating an in situ doped LPCVD- based poly-Si passivating contact, according to our knowledge [25]. Moreover, the achieved    is also on par with the highest certified    of 23.06% obtained in our group using the conventional ex situ doped  Fig. 6.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a) a fully textured, b) the semi-textured, and c) the polished rear surface morphology.

LPCVD-based poly-Si passivating contacts (data not published yet). Second, it is important to note that the certified FF of the best solar cell is 1.1% higher than the corresponding FF measured in-house, which is attributed to the certified measurement neglecting front and rear grid-resistance contributions, as indicated in Fig. 10 [45]. Nevertheless, even with 1.1% higher FF, resistive losses remain dominant and the discussions in previous sections regarding the FF loss analyses are valid. Third, DARC yields an average increase in    by 0.2%, which is due to a significant improvement in J sc  by 0.5 mA/cm 2 . The resulting average J sc  of 40.8 mA/cm 2  matches the J sc  obtained in the literature using a similar DARC design on n-TOPCon solar cells [33]. We would like to note that using a DARC at the rear side of the solar cells can also be useful for boosting the bifaciality, but this would come at the price of increased process complexity. Table 5 also shows that, as expected, DARC has little to no impact on V oc . The FF does not show a significant change either, only a 0.2% drop, and the r s  does not change, even though the extra SiO x  film to realize the DARC was deposited onto the Ag fingers. We speculate that the wires of the I–V measurement setup with high mechanical  Fig. 7.a) Schematic of the symmetrically passivated monitors investigated by photoluminescence (PL) imaging.

Further analysis of the J sc  increase after the realization of the DARC was performed by R and EQE measurements on solar cells with single and double ARC, as shown in Fig. 11. It is evident from these data that the reduced R at short and long wavelengths and the resulting increase in EQE cause the optical improvement of the solar cells, as expected. It is important to note that the thickness of the SiN x  film in the DARC structure was optimized for a single but not double ARC, yielding the second dip in R at a quite long wavelength of ~1000 nm. Hence, room for further improvement of the R spectrum, the J sc , and thus the    exists by optimizing the DARC stack. 3.4.Damp heat and thermal cycling tests on 1-cell n-TOPCon solar laminates The results of the damp heat and thermal cycling tests applied to 1- cell laminates containing the developed n-TOPCon solar cells are shown in Fig. 12. These indicate that P out  of the laminates, initially equal to ~4.9 W, does not drop and even increase by ~1% relative upon 1000 h of damp heat testing (see Fig. 12a)) and by ~2% relative after 400 thermal cycles (see Fig. 12b)). Hence, the laminates pass the damp heat and thermal cycling tests (P out  loss ≤5% for a single IEC61215 test), showing that the screen-printed fingers of the developed solar cells do not degrade due to moisture and the interconnections between the fin - gers and the wires of the laminates do not fail due to thermal cycling. The results of this first assessment indicate that the developed solar cells can be suitable for integration in PV modules in the glass-glass config - uration. In the more conventional glass-backsheet configuration, PV modules are known to be more susceptible to failure, particularly during the damp heat test, due to moisture ingress through the backsheet [46]. Hence, for assessing the suitability of the developed solar cells for application in glass-backsheet modules, the applied tests are to be repeated using the glass-backsheet configuration. Furthermore, for a complete study of the reliability of PV modules based on the developed n-TOPCon solar cells, further investigations such as potential induced degradation and humidity freeze tests are required and will be per - formed in the future. Further analysis of the I–V parameters of the laminates leads to a few more conclusions. First, for both laminates, the cell-to-laminate losses were found to be high, with the laminates having ~2% absolute lower    than the cells, equal to 20.1–20.3%. This is expected, as the laminates were not optimized for maximizing the   . Among the other I–V param - eters, the V oc  does not change significantly upon lamination, remaining at ~690 mV, while the J sc  drops by ~1.6 mA/cm 2 , to ~38.7 mA/cm 2 , because of the optical losses at laminate level, mainly due to the use of glass without ARC for the preparation of the laminates. Moreover, the FF drops by ~4.5% absolute, to 75.5–75.9%, which is attributed to the series resistance contribution of the interconnections, raising the r s  of the laminates to ~1.5 cm 2 , which is significantly higher than the r s  of the solar cells before lamination. Investigating the impact of the per - formed tests on the I–V parameters of the laminates shows that, for the laminate subjected to the damp heat test, the 1% relative increase in P out  originates mainly from an increase in J sc , from 38.7 mA/cm 2  to 39 mA/ cm 2 . This improvement in J sc  is not well-understood. For the thermal cycling, the evolution of P out  clearly follows the FF of the laminate, as depicted in Fig. 12b). Other I–V parameters were found to remain un - changed during thermal cycling. Interestingly, FF increased signifi - cantly, by 3.1% absolute, during the first 100 cycles, after which it dropped by 1.3% absolute during the following 300 cycles. The initial FF improvement is associated with a significant drop in the series resistance of the laminate, which is attributed to modifications in the properties of the interconnections, as the series resistance of the solar cell itself is not expected to change during thermal cycling. Nevertheless, the physical mechanism behind the change in the properties of the interconnections is not well-understood. 4.Roadmap for improving the n-TOPCon solar cells While a high certified    of 23.01% is demonstrated in this work, it is important to assess the ultimate potential of the n-TOPCon solar cells  Fig. 10.Result of the certified I–V measurement of the best n-TOPCon solar cell fabricated in this work.

M. Fırat et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts, as record large- area n-TOPCon solar cells fabricated by the PV industry already ach - ieved    up to 25.4% [4]. For this purpose, a roadmap is established by Quokka 2 simulations and presented in Fig. 13, showing that, with proper design and process optimizations, solar cells with    of 25.5% can be achieved using in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts. Fig. 13 shows that the initial simulation to match the best solar cell using the parameters in Table 1 yields    �22.8%, along with V oc  �694.7 mV, J sc  �40.4 mA/cm 2 , and FF �81.1%. Comparison of these simulation results with the measured I–V parameters in Table 4 of the modeled best solar cell indicate 0.4% higher simulated    due to 0.7% higher simulated FF and 4.5 mV higher simulated V oc , while the simu - lated and the measured J sc  are perfectly matched. This is expected, since (i) accurately measuring the FF of zero-busbar devices is difficult and the measured FF can be an underestimation, particularly given the 1.1% difference between the FF determined in-house and at ISFH CalTeC as discussed in Section 3.3, and (ii) the V oc  of the best solar cell suffered a 2–3 mV loss due to the contamination at the edges as discussed in Sec - tion 3.2, which is not considered in the simulations. Therefore, the model of the best solar cell based on the parameters in Table 1 is considered valid. The main factors limiting the efficiency of the best solar cell were found to be recombination losses in the bulk and at the front surface and contacts. As wafers with significantly higher bulk quality i.e.,   B  up to 8 ms are commercially available [47], the first step of the roadmap assessed the improvement achievable by improving the wafer quality. As Fig. 13 shows, the use of wafers with   B  �8 ms leads to a significant    gain of 0.9% due to the FF and the V oc  increasing by 1.9% and 9 mV, respectively. It is interesting to note that most of this gain (0.7% in   ) can be obtained already for   B  �4 ms, showing that the increase in    with   B  has a saturating behavior. Step 2 and 3 of the roadmap shows that    can then be increased by 0.4%, to above 24%, by (i) reducing   B  to 1 cm, and   c,f  and   c,r  to 1 mcm 2  using improved screen-printing pastes, (ii) further developing the screen-printing process to realize narrower fin - gers with w f  �w r  �20   m, and (iii) optimizing the grid design for the lower   c,f  and   c,r  by increasing the pitch of the fingers. These im - provements mainly affect the FF, yielding a 0.6% increase. In step 4, another    gain of 0.2% is predicted when going for thinner poly-Si films with t poly  �75 nm, which is expected to become the industry standard thickness by 2028 when new screen-printing pastes which can contact thinner poly-Si films with low J 0,m  are developed [1]. As explained before, reduced t poly  results in less FCA and a consequent 0.3 mA/cm 2  increase in J sc . An impressive    of 24.3% i.e., a gain of 1.5% absolute, can be achieved after these 4 steps of the roadmap, relying on indus - trially feasible improvements only. In step 5, implementing a DARC enhances the J sc  and the    by 0.6 mA/cm 2  and 0.3%, respectively, in agreement with the experimental results in Table 5. It should be noted, however, that this improvement would not translate to module level due to optical losses in encapsulants and as the refractive index of the SiO x  film used in the simulations as the top layer of DARC is not suitable for module applications. Lastly, steps 6, 7, and 8 of the roadmap foresee the reduction in recombination losses at the front surface of the solar cell. In step 6, the losses in the non- metallized regions are decreased using a deeper, advanced emitter. The advanced emitter is known to yield a lower J 0,p,f  of 16 fA/cm 2  [48], and results in 3 mV higher V oc  and 0.1% higher   . In step 7, recombi - nation losses in the metallized regions are reduced by introducing a selective emitter. The selective emitter is assumed to reduce J 0,m,f  down to 50 fA/cm 2 , a value possibly achievable with p-type passivating con - tacts, yielding 7 mV higher V oc  and 0.3% higher   , thus reaching    �25%. While the improvements to the emitter considered in steps 6 and 7 are available technologies and can be used for fabricating solar cells with record efficiencies, it can be difficult to implement those in pro - duction, since fabrication of the advanced emitter requires a long pro - cess duration [48] and realizing the selective emitter requires patterning, increasing the process complexity. In step 8, recombination losses in the non-metallized regions of the front surface are further reduced using a transparent passivating contact at the front, covering the entire solar cell. This could potentially be achieved by applying a full-area p-type poly-Si passivating contact to the front surface and thinning down the poly-Si film between the contact fingers to obtain low thicknesses and mitigate parasitic absorption losses [49,50]. For the transparent passivating contact, a J 0,p,f  of 5 fA/cm 2  is assumed in step 8. This yields an 11 mV increase in V oc , a 0.3% improvement in FF, and a 0.5% higher   , resulting in    �25.5%. 5.Summary and outlook Realizing in situ P-doped poly-Si films by LPCVD offers the prospect of simplifying the manufacturing of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells, by eliminating the need for an external doping process, prevalent in the industry today. In this work, the potential of in situ P-doped LPCVD poly- Si films was demonstrated at solar cell and laminate level, by integrating them in passivating contacts at the rear side of large-area bifacial n- TOPCon devices. To achieve the highest efficiencies possible, the solar cell design was optimized starting with an investigation on the impact of the poly-Si film thickness on the solar cell performance. This study revealed the necessity of using a t poly  ˘150 nm to properly passivate the areas metallized by screen-printing, allowing J 0,m,r  ℜ100 fA/cm 2 . While such thicker layers were found to yield slightly lower J 0,p,r  and   c,r  as well, they were also responsible for increased FCA, reducing the J sc  of the solar cells by ~0.15 mA/cm 2  per 50 nm increase in t poly . As a result of this trade-off between the electrical and optical properties of the devices, the average    saturated just below 22% for t poly  ˘150 nm, when a semi-textured rear surface morphology was used. A t poly  of 150 nm was therefore chosen for further development. Further improvement of the solar cell design was achieved by real - izing a flatter, polished rear surface for the devices, resulting in an average    of 22.4%. This was found to be mainly due to improved light trapping at the rear side, increasing J sc  by 0.5 mA/cm 2 . The electrical performance of the passivating contact also improved on the polished surface, yielding J 0,p,r  �2.3 fA/cm 2 , J 0,m,r  �65.8 fA/cm 2 , and   c,r  �2.0 mcm 2 . A further gain in J sc  by 0.5 mA/cm 2  was then obtained by applying a double ARC to the front surface of the devices, in the form of an additional SiO x  layer on top of the SiN x  layer, which resulted in a broadband reduction in R. This resulted in    being higher by 0.2% on average, and the best solar cell had a certified    of 23.01%, accompanied by a high V oc  of 691.7 mV, and a high J sc  of 40.95 mA/cm 2 . The fabricated n-TOPCon solar cells were also incorporated in 1-cell laminates, which were subjected to 1000 h of damp heat testing and 400 cycles of thermal cycling. Upon both tests, P out  of the laminates did not degrade but increased by 1–2%. Hence, the laminates passed the tests, indicating that the developed solar cells can be suitable for use in PV  Fig. 13.Roadmap to 25.5% n-TOPCon solar cell efficiency established by Quokka 2 simulations. The improvements to the solar cell design and fabrica - tion process applied in each simulation step are listed at the right-hand side.  M. Fırat et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     modules. Lastly, the ultimate efficiency potential of n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts was predicted by establishing a roadmap to an    of 25.5% using Quokka 2 simulations. Among the strategies outlined in the roadmap, the most effective im - provements to the solar cell design and fabrication process were found to be the use of wafers with higher bulk lifetimes and of advanced and selective emitter as well as transparent passivating contact technologies for enhanced passivation of the front side of the solar cells. Our future work will focus on following the roadmap established in this paper to achieve the foreseen improvements to    experimentally. Furthermore, further simplification of the process used for fabricating n- TOPCon solar cells will be targeted by developing fired passivating contacts based on the in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films used in this work, thereby skipping the post-LPCVD annealing process.

Based on device simulations we continuously develop an efficiency roadmap for a steady improvement of our PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) process. Following this simulation based approach, we effectively improve the front side metallization and the emitter characteristics. Currently, our best prototype process has reached a conversion efficiency well over 21% which enables the manufacturing of a  60-cell based module with a power of 310W. Our best cell so far has a conversion efficiency of 21.5% which has been confirmed by the calibration laboratory of Fraunhofer ISE. This is to our knowledge the highest efficiency reported for industrial-size silicon solar cells with screen-printed metal front and rear contacts.    © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Starting from an average production efficiency of 20.2% we aim at continuously improving the manufacturing processes for front side metallization, emitter diffusion, passivation and rear contact formation. Regarding the module technology, the multi bus-bar design is assumed to be the main  optimization step. With these optimization steps, we expect 22.5% efficient p-type solar cells with PERC technology available in the market within the next few years.     Fig. 1. Efficiency roadmap for our PERC technology; based on device simulations.    2.   Technological optimizations 2.1.   Front side metallization According to our roadmap, the first step is the optimization of the front side metallization. We used standard single-print screen printing technology to circumvent the higher process complexity of double printing, hence busbars and fingers are printed within one squeegee stroke. The grid layout consisted of 90 fingers as well as 3 busbars with optimized design to reduce paste consumption and shadowing. Starting from 55μm finger screen opening, we compere 49-μm to 45-μm finger openings for this investigation. Both groups consisted of about 50 solar cells each. The resulting grid lines and IV-data are displayed in Fig. 2 left and right, respectively. The smallest screen opening allowed for a fired gridline width of remarkable 48 μm. This leads to slightly higher JSC due to reduced shading compared to the cells printed with the wider finger opening. However, the higher series resistance of the cells with lower finger width could not be compensated by the higher JSC in this experiment, resulting in a slight efficiency drop of 0.04%abs. Improved pastes and screens are necessary to benefit from the lower finger opening.  ���������������������������������������517       Fig. 2. Optical microscope images of the fine-line screen printed Ag grid lines measured after firing on completely processed PERC cells (left) and IV-data of the screen opening split experiment (right). 2.2.   Emitter The next important progress in our roadmap is a further emitter optimization. Thus, we have to balance the series resistance and the recombination losses. The well-known correlation between emitter sheet resistance  �! SH,em and emitter saturation current density J0e can be modified by improved P-diffusion [4] and surface passivation. In Fig. 3 we compare different options for the emitter, including selectively versus directly contacted emitters and different front side passivation options. For the determination of the emitter saturation current density J0e high-ohmic Cz wafers are used which are textured, diffused and passivated identically on both sides and finally fired in a belt furnace. J0e is derived using the procedure of Kane and Swanson [5] in combination with the quasi-steady state photoconductance (QSSPC) method [6]. For the evaluation the Richter Auger model and Band-gap narrowing (BGN) is used [7], i.e. the effective intrinsic carrier density depends on the boron doping concentration.  518����������������������������������������  Fig. 3. Emitter sheet resistance  �! SH,em and emitter saturation current density (J0e) for different P-diffusion and surface passivation processes. For the evaluation the Richter Auger model and Band-gap narrowing (BGN) is used [7]. 3.   Results In order to demonstrate the potential of our improvements we implemented the above discussed optimizations.        Table 1.

Saw damage removal and texturing were done using alkaline solutions. The rear side passivation stack was adjusted in respect of low surface recombination velocity Srear, high internal reflection and thermal stability. The rear contacts were implemented with a local BSF underneath. In terms of contacting the emitter and base we used standard screen printing technologies. We selected a 5 busbar design with the identified optimal 49 μm finger openings. The emitter  ���������������������������������������519 with optimized passivation II (see Fig. 3) and a selectively doped emitter (see Fig. 3) underneath the grid lines are used.  Currently our best median efficiency of a 200 wafer group processed in our clean room environment at Solarworld Innovations GmbH with the above discussed optimized processes has reached 21.1% with a very small  standard deviation of only 0.12%abs (see Table 1). Our best cell has a conversion efficiency of 21.51% which has been independently measured at the Fraunhofer ISE calibration laboratory. This is to our knowledge the highest efficiency reported so far for industrial-size silicon solar cells with screen printed metal front and rear contacts. For the module assembly we chose a half cell design to have lower resistance losses due to the higher voltage and lower current flow [8]. Therefore, first a laser carves the cell in the middle. Subsequently the cells are broken in half.  This cutting process has only a very minor impact on the cell performance due to a slightly increased edge recombination. The module demonstrates independently confirmed 310Wp with a module conversion efficiency of 19.4%.

In this work, the effects of different chemical etching methods and weight loss on the surface topography and passivation characteristics and contact resistance of SiO x /n +poly Si passivated contact structures were investigated by finely controlling the etching process. Studies have shown that for textured surfaces, both increasing the roundness of the pyramids (acid polishing) and flattening the pyramids (alkaline polishing) lead to a more uniform SiO x  layer, which improves surface passivation. The significant deterioration of the contact resistance of the alkali-polished flat surface may be more due to the influence of the thickness of the tunnel oxide layer and the concentration of trailing P doping in the substrate. Acid polishing preserves the round pyramid structure but removes the sharp pyramid tips, improving contact passivation while ensuring good metal contact. It can better balance the contradiction be - tween passivation characteristics (J 0  ~ 4.73fA/cm2, J 0, metal  ~ 67.26fA/cm 2 , iVoc ~ 740 mV) and contact characteristics (  c, B  ~ 1.67mcm 2 ), and achieve the highest average cell efficiency (24.05%).    1.Introduction At present, the efficiency of P-type PERC cells exceeds 23%, which is close to its efficiency limit, so the process of improving efficiency is slowing down [27,50]. Based on the concept of carrier selectivity, the German Institute ISFH analyzed the theoretical limit efficiencies of PERC, HIT, and TOPCon cells of 24.5%, 27.5%, and 28.7%, respectively [39]. Among them, the n-type TOPCon cell is widely considered to be one of the most promising next-generation high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell technologies after the PERC cell and has been extensively studied in recent years[8,9,10,11,29,230,31,35,45]. The efficiency of small-area double-sided metal contact N-type TOPCON solar cells pre - pared in the laboratory is as high as 25.8% [36]. The POLO-IBC with an interdigitated back contact structure combined with a passivation con - tact structure achieved an ultrahigh efficiency of 26.1% [17]. BJ-FBC uses back-junction full-area passivation contacts on the basis of double-sided metal contacts, which have also been proven to achieve >26% efficiency [37]. In recent years, the efficiency of large-area Topcon solar cells used for mass production has also continued to break through, with the highest reported efficiency reaching 25.7% [5,14]. The N-TOPCON solar cell structure is to prepare an ultra-thin tunnel oxide layer and a thin n +highly doped polysilicon layer on the back of the cell to form a passivation contact structure together [19,20,24,26,32,41,43,46,48,51]. Compared with the smooth surface silicon wafers used in the laboratory, it is difficult to form high-quality passivation contact structures on large-area rough surface silicon wa - fers used in solar cell industrial production. The reason for this is that the passivation quality is sensitive to the thickness of the SiOx layer [21,22,23]. The increased roughness of the pyramidal Si(111) surface leads to more surface defects than the polished Si(111) surface, which in turn may affect the growth of the SiOx layer[33]. The pyramidal morphology of pyramidal tips, faces, edges, and valleys contributes to the SiOx inhomogeneity [3]. This causes the SiOx layer near the pyramid valleys to become thinner than the pyramid tips or end faces, which can significantly affect the passivation performance [47]. At the same time, the low-reflectivity pyramidal surface allows more light into the  *Corresponding authors at: Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China.

Therefore, under the requirements of improving passiv - ation characteristics and optical absorption, a smoother and higher reflectivity polished surface is an effective optimization direction. However, metal contact points need to be optimized in the opposite direction. Pyramid faces are more conducive to forming good contacts, thereby reducing contact resistance and increasing FF. On the one hand, surface topography can affect the formation of silver crystallites [4,18,34]. On the other hand, the rough surface is easier to realize the direct transport of carriers. Silver crystallites transport carriers in four ways, among which direct transport between silver crystallites and metal grid lines (without glass layer in between) is very important to achieve low contact resistance [14,15]. This transfer is easier to achieve on the tips of pyramidal surfaces and similar rough surfaces that are not easily covered by layers of glass. In the industrial mass production of solar cells, edge isolation after diffusion is a very important process step. Using laser edge isolation is a solution, but is less used today [28]. Wet chemical etching is the more commonly used method, and during this process, the topography of the backside can also be modified simultaneously to match the backside tunnel oxide/polysilicon fabrication process and screen printed metal contacts. For N-type TOPCon cells, the excellent passivation perfor - mance, contact performance and minimal parasitic absorption of the back tunnel oxide/N +polysilicon layer are the keys to achieve high efficiency. All three are affected by the topography of the rear surface. Some etching-related research has been done and promoted the further improvement of solar cell efficiency. Inline process using HNO 3 /HF solution or batch process using alkaline solution are the two main pro - cess routes [2,7]. Etching with HNO 3 /HF solution can round the pyra - mids [53], thereby obtaining superior light absorption characteristics compared with flat surfaces, and at the same time obtaining better passivation characteristics than textured surfaces, thereby improving efficiency [14,15]. Etching with alkaline solution can eliminate the in - fluence of sharp pyramid tips, but it is necessary to strictly control the polishing process to obtain an ideal pyramid base size to reduce the impact on ohmic contact [6]. In order to obtain higher efficiencies for industrially fabricated TOPCon solar cells, optimization of the backside topography is necessary. However, the differences in passivation char - acteristics and contact characteristics between different wet etching processes and different conditions of the same etching process have not been carefully studied. Relevant research is needed to provide technical support for the selection and optimization of wet process in actual mass production. In this work, a large-area (274.15 cm2) N-type TOPCon solar cell was fabricated using a screen-printed silver paste method to achieve metal - –semiconductor contact. Electron-selective passivation contacts are based on the thermal oxide growth of a tunnel oxide layer and LPCVD deposition of an intrinsic polysilicon layer, followed by doping and recrystallization by thermal diffusion of POCl 3  in an industrial-scale quartz tube furnace. Different chemical etching methods (acid polish - ing and alkali polishing) are used to achieve modification of the backside topography. By finely controlling the etching amount, the difference in surface morphology after different polishing weight reductions achieved by acid polishing and alkali polishing was studied. The effects of different surface topography on doping concentration, passivation characteristics of contact and non-contact regions, and contact resis - tance were investigated. Based on the requirements of edge isolation and removal of the back diffusion PN junction, the effects of different back topography on the performance of TOPCon cells were explored. The study showed that acid polishing improved the surface flatness by rounding the pyramids while ensuring good metal contact, achieving a compromise between metal contact characteristics and passivation characteristics, and finally achieved the highest average solar cell effi - ciency of 24.05%.Compared with alkali polishing and alkali texturing samples, it increased by 0.33% and 0.18% respectively. 2.Experiment A sample with a two-sided symmetric structure (shown in Fig. 1a) was used to investigate the properties of the tunnel oxide/phosphorus- doped polysilicon passivation contact structure. The substrate is an n- type commercial DWS mc-Si wafer (166 ×166 mm 2 ) with a thickness of 165 ±10   m and a resistivity of 0.5–2 cm. The preparation process is shown in Fig. 2(a). After texturing, the wafers were etched using two different chemical cleaning processes, as shown in Table 1, including (1) acid polishing and (2) alkali polishing. The additives used in this paper were all prepared by our laboratory. Through formula optimization and improvement, texturing additives can obtain uniform pyramid size and low reflectivity, and polishing additives can obtain good polishing properties and oxide layer protection. Then, an ultra-thin tunnel oxide layer is grown using thermal oxidation, followed by the deposition of an intrinsic polysilicon layer by LPCVD [52]. Low-pressure phosphorous diffusion doping was per - formed using a tubular diffusion furnace. Use HF solution to remove PSG and perform Radio Corporation of America (RCA) cleaning. Finally, double-sided silicon nitride films are grown by PECVD. The dopant profiles of the samples were measured by an ECV device (WEP CVP21). J 0, Auger  in the c-Si substrate was estimated using simulations on EDNA2 provided by PVlighthouse.Minority carrier lifetime (  eff ), Implied open circuit voltage (iVoc), and recombination current (J 0 ) were tested by WCT-120 Sinton(@5E15) [25], which can show the passivation char - acteristics of the symmetric samples. To evaluate the difference in passivation of metal contacts with different surface topographies, J 0 ,  metal  was tested. For the symmetrical sample shown in Fig. 1(a), four different metallization fractions (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) were screen printed and fired,then the metal was removed using HNO 3 /HCL solu - tion. Test the J 0  of symmetrical samples with different metallization area fractions, and perform simple linear interpolation of the test data points using the method proposed by Fellmeth et al [12]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S4800) was used to characterize the surface and cross-sectional morphologies after different wet etching. Use a reflectance tester to determine the reflectance. The contact resistance of the metal grid lines of the samples with different morphologies was tested by the transfer-length-method (TLM, GP-4 TEST)to evaluate whether the samples formed good metal contact with the silver paste [16]. Samples of both structures were tested to evaluate the contact resistance under different current transfer modes. The first structure is shown in Fig. 3(a), that is, the backside structure of a standard TOPCON solar cell. Due to the thin thickness of the tunnel oxide layer and the existence of pinholes in the oxide layer, there may be localized metal burn-through. At the same time, the doping tailing of P atoms in the substrate is also inevitable, so the transport path of the current includes the transport through the polysilicon and the substrate. The second structure is shown in Fig. 3(b), the polysilicon region is separated by a thick oxide layer insulating region (>100 nm), and the current only flows through the polysilicon region. The sheet resistance of this sample after phosphorous diffusion is 40–45 /sq.The test results are called back contact resistivity (  c,B ) and polysilicon contact resistivity (  c,P ). The structure of the TOPCon solar cell is shown in Fig. 1(b), and its process flow is shown in Fig. 2(b). After texturing in an alkaline solution, the front emitter was formed by low-pressure BCl 3  diffusion in an industrial-scale quartz tube furnace. Then, the backside and edge diffusion junctions are removed by wet chemical cleaning etch, and the topography of the backside is modified. In order to keep the front surface pyramids unaffected during the backside chemical etching process, an inline process single-side etching method (SSE) was adopted and BSG was used as a protective film. The specific process is shown in Table 1. Thermal oxidation grows a tunnel oxide layer. 80 nm intrinsic poly - silicon is grown in LPCVD followed by POCl 3  diffusion with a sheet resistance of 30–35 /sq. After etching the Wrap-around polysilicon, Al 2 O 3 /SiNx (ALD/PECVD) and SiNx (PECVD) stacks were deposited on the front and back sides, respectively. The thickness of SiNx is 80–90 nm  C.

Finally, metal contact is achieved by screen printing followed by co-fired annealing. Activation of H passivation is achieved by electron injection annealing. The photoelec - tric conversion efficiency is determined by measuring the cur - rent–voltage (I-V) characteristic curve. External quantum efficiency (EQE), internal quantum efficiency (IQE), and light reflection were measured using the PVE300-IVT. The optical loss analysis results are from the Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 Optical Loss provided by the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore [49]. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Influence of surface morphology on passivation and contact characteristics of SiO X /n +poly Si structures According to the weight loss of polishing, the experimental samples were divided into 4 groups, and the weight loss of silicon wafers was 0.1 g-0.4 g g respectively. The textured sample is referred to as T0. For alkali-polished groups, they are referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in  Fig. 1.(a)Schematic diagram of the double-sided symmetric sample (b)Schematic diagram of TOPCON solar cell sample.

Guo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      sequence according to the increase in weight loss. For acid-polished groups, they are called E1, E2, E3, and E4. Fig. 4 is the SEM photo - graphs of the surface morphology after different wet chemical treat - ments (texture (a), acid polishing (b-e), alkali polishing (f-i)). The complete pyramid can be seen in the textured sample. The original textured sample T0 had a reflectance of 10.3%. The weight loss of acid-polished samples is controlled mainly by changing the belt speed of the chain etching cleaner and changing the ratio of chemical solu - tions. The weight loss of alkali-polished samples is mainly controlled by changing the chemical reaction time. Fig. 5(a) shows the alkali polishing weight loss as a function of time, indicating that no reaction occurred during the first 40 s due to the presence of the surface oxide layer. After polishing for 40 s, a violent reaction begins accompanied by smoothing of the surface and weight loss. After polishing for 90 s, the weight loss reaches 0.1 g, 170 s reaches 0.2 g, 285 s reaches 0.3 g, and 460 s reaches 0.4 g. The polishing speed is first fast and then slow. The test points are fitted to a curve, as shown by the red dotted line in Fig. 5(a). Under the polishing conditions set in this experiment, the silicon wafer weight loss and polishing time satisfy the following equation: ·��0:0463�0:00168×��1:58∗�6�× 2 (1) It can be seen that both acid polishing and alkali polishing can significantly change the surface roughness of silicon wafers, but the surface roughness of acid-polished samples is significantly lower than that of alkali-polished samples. After acid polishing, the shape of the pyramid of the sample has changed, and the sharp pyramid tip disap - pears and becomes a sloped hill, similar to a rounded pyramid. As the weight reduction increases, the slope becomes smaller, the sharpness of the peak decreases, and the flatness of the surface increases. With the increase in weight loss, the reflectance of acid-polished samples was 30.5%, 32.9%, 35%, and 36%, respectively. For alkali polishing sam - ples, the tip of the pyramid is completely flattened, and only the square base of the pyramid can be seen. As the weight loss increases, the size of the square increases. From the scanning electron microscope images, it can be seen that the square sizes are 6   m, 13   m, 19   m, and 27   m, respectively. The increase in the base square symbolizes the increase in flatness. Even if the sample weight is only reduced by 0.1 g (P1), a relatively flat surface can already be obtained, but local protrusions are retained. As shown in Fig. 5(b), corresponding to different weight loss, the reflectance of alkali-polished samples is 39.68%, 43.51%, 44.49%, and 45.38%. The effect of different surface topography on the passivation quality of TOPCon is shown in Fig. 6. It can be observed that both alkali pol - ishing and acid polishing can improve the passivation characteristics of symmetrical samples. Compared with acid polishing, alkali polishing makes the surface smoother, and the quality and uniformity of the ultra- thin tunnel oxide layer are better, so the passivation characteristics are more advantageous [21,22,23]. The passivation characteristics become better as the etch weight loss increases. Among them, the passivation quality of the alkali polished sample is the best, the reverse saturation current J 0  of the P4 sample is the smallest (3.23fA/cm 2 ), the minority carrier lifetime is the longest (2579   s), and the iVoc is the largest (742.7 mV). The passivation quality of the alkali textured sample T0 is the worst, the reverse saturation current J 0  is the largest (5.93fA/cm 2 ), the minority carrier lifetime is the smallest (1663   s), and the iVoc is also the smallest (735 mV). The passivation quality of the acid-polished samples was intermediate between the other two.

In the case of the same weight loss, the iVoc of alkali polishing is 2 mV higher than that of acid polishing. In the case of weight loss of 0.4 g, the iVoc of E4 and P4 samples reaches the maximum, which are 740 mV and 742.7 mV, respectively. It can also be seen that although the acid-polished sample does not achieve a smooth and flat surface, the removal of the high pyramid tip can significantly and effectively improve the passivation characteristics of the tunnel oxide polysilicon structure. Fig. 6(c) shows the phosphorus doping concentrations of the samples with different backside morphologies after POCl 3  diffusion. For the doping concentration in polysilicon, there is a difference between the samples with different surface topography, which is caused by the dif - ference in surface area. For the doping concentration in c-Si, it can be shown that the barrier effect of the tunneling oxide layer on diffusion in  Fig. 4.SEM images of the surface morphologies after different backside wet chemical treatments (texture (a), acid polishing (b-e), alkali polishing (f-i)).

Guo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      samples with different surface topography, which can partly explain the differences in the quality and passivation performance of the tunneling oxide layer in samples with different topography. The P tailing doping concentration in single crystal silicon is specially extracted, as shown in Fig. 6(c), where depth =0 is the tunnel oxide layer/single crystal silicon interface.Inside the c-Si substrate, due to the blocking effect of the oxide layer on the diffusion of P atoms, the doping concentration of the acid- polished and alkali-polished samples will drop rapidly to below 1E19cm �3  in the range of 20 nm. It can be observed that the doping concentration of the alkali-polished samples is always lower than that of the acid-polished samples. This may simply be due to surface area dif - ferences. Whereas in the textured samples, at the tunneling oxide/silicon substrate interface, the doping concentration of phosphorus atoms does not drop rapidly to a lower level like in other samples but starts to decrease slowly from a higher concentration�·1E20cm �3 �×. This shows that the diffusion barrier effect of the tunneling oxide layer of the alkali textured sample is poor, and the excessive diffusion of phosphorus atoms into the silicon substrate will intensify the Auger recombination in the substrate and weaken the passivation effect. This is due to the fact that the pyramidal structure of the textured sample leads to inconsistent thicknesses of the tunneling oxide layer at different positions of the pyramid, resulting in the cracking of the thinner oxide layer in some areas during high-temperature annealing. Typically, the SiOx thickness at the top, edges, and faces of the pyramids is thicker than that near the pyramid valleys. Since the passivation properties from n +polysilicon/ SiOx contacts are dependent on the thickness of SiOx, the increased roundness of the pyramids (acid polishing) and flattening of the pyra - mids (alkaline polishing) may result in a more uniform SiOx layer and thus improved surface passivation. For high-quality silicon, when the impurity concentration exceeds 1E18cm �3  and the surface passivation has been done well enough, Auger recombination will become the main recombination mechanism at high injection levels. The doping concentration of the material will significantly affect the Auger recombination. For the P-doping concen - tration distribution in Fig. 6(c), we tried to use EDNA2 to simulate to estimate J 0, Auger  in the c-Si substrate, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 (d). By properly setting the simulation parameters, the relative value of J 0, Auger  can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(d). In the textured samples, J 0, Auger  is the largest, reaching 8.78fA/cm 2 . The alkali-polished P4 group reaches a minimum of 3.23fA/cm 2 . Simulation J 0, Auger  results show the same variation trend as test J 0  results, but the simulation re - sults are too large. This is similar to findings in other studies [31]. It could be due to overestimation of J 0, Auger  within EDNA2 (e.g. due to small errors in BGN or other models in the software, or simply over - estimation errors in dopant distribution within silicon) or underesti - mation of J 0 . In fact, the difference in J 0  is the combined effect of Auger recombination J 0, Auger , SiOx/c-Si chemical passivation, and other factors. The difference in J 0  caused by different surface topography does not seem to be large, but it is known that the main purpose and advantage of  Fig. 6.(a)  eff ,(b)iVoc of samples with different morphologies.

Guo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      the passivation contact structure is to reduce the degradation caused by the metal contact. But even so, high temperature annealing still causes some damage to the passivation contact structure, thus causing more recombination in the metal contact area. In this regard, the J 0, metal  of silver paste screen-printed and annealed samples with different mor - phologies were tested to characterize the difference in metal contact passivation with different surface morphologies. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Different surface topography has a huge impact on J 0, metal , and the effect is more significant than that of J 0 . For the textured sample, its J 0, metal  is the largest, reaching 131.6fA/cm 2 , which may be related to the formation of more silver crystallites due to the existence of the pyramid tip. Both acid polishing and alkali polishing can significantly reduce J 0, metal , but under the same polishing weight loss, the J 0, metal  of acid polishing samples is always greater than that of alkali polishing samples. The likely reasons are that the flat surface allows for thicker film thickness and better densification, and the lower actual annealing temperature due to high reflectivity results in less metal burn-through. More importantly, surface planarization seriously affects the formation of silver crystallites. Although the acid-polished samples retained the rounded pyramids, J 0, metal  was significantly reduced with increasing polishing weight loss, suggesting that the removal of sharp pyramid apexes and reduction of texture slopes can also improve metal contact passivation properties. The E4 and P4 samples with the largest weight loss achieved the largest J 0, metal , which were 51.46 and 41.77fA/cm 2 , respectively. This is almost a third of the J 0, metal  of the texturing sample. This indicates that the adjustment of the surface topography has a much greater effect on the passivation performance of the metal contact area than that of the non-metal contact area. On the other hand, we need to consider the contact between samples with different morphologies and the silver paste. Fig. 8 shows the con - tact resistivity of samples with different surface topography. The two structures described in Fig. 3 were tested respectively, and the test re - sults were   c, B  and   c, P . It can be seen from Fig. 6(1) that,   c, B �·tex - turing sample �×<  c, B �·acid polishing sample �×  c, B �·alkali polishing sample�×. The   c, B  of the texturing sample is the smallest, reaching 0.69mcm 2 . With the increase of polishing weight loss, the surface of the sample becomes flatter, and the contact resistivity   c, B  increases. It can be seen that with the increase in weight loss, the in - crease of   c, B  of the alkali-polished samples is much larger than that of the acid-polished samples. It can be observed from Fig. 6(2) that for   c, P , the difference between samples with different morphologies is not as large as   c, B . The texturing sample also obtained the smallest   c, P , but its value was much larger than   c, B , which was 5.46mcm 2 . With the increase of polishing weight loss, the contact resistivity   c, P  increased slightly. At the same time, the difference between the acid-polished and alkali-polished samples was very small. When the weight loss of the sample increases to 0.3 g, the   c, P  of the acid-polished and alkali- polished samples are very similar. We observed that for samples with the same morphology, the dif - ference between   c, B  and   c, P  was very large, and showed different trends after wet chemical etching. The difference in the measured values of the two sample structures may be due to the different current trans - port paths.   c, B  is affected by the contact between metal-polysilicon and the contact between metal-polysilicon-tunnel oxide-single-crystal sili - con substrate.  c, P  is only affected by the metal/polysilicon contact. This is because the thick oxide layer blocks the transport of current through the substrate, which only occurs in polysilicon. The small differences in   c, P  in samples with different morphologies may indicate that the pol - ysilicon and metal in the three morphological samples have formed similar and good ohmic contacts. Minor differences may come from the metal-covered surface area, and actual firing temperature [18,44]. After the polishing weight loss is relatively large, the change of the surface area also slows down, which may also be the reason why   c, P  does not continue to increase. Since   c, P  shows a smaller increase with polishing weight loss, the change in   c, B  is more likely to be related to the smoother surface after polishing and the reduction of pinholes in the tunnel oxide layer. Theoretically, the silver paste does not burn through the tunnel oxide layer. But in fact, samples with different morphologies may have different pinhole densities due to the presence of stress during the high-temperature diffusion process, and these pinholes may become areas where the metal burns through. More pinholes are formed on the surface of the pyramid while flattening the surface topography reduces the density of pinholes. For the region of metal burn-through, the P doping concentration in the sample substrates with different morphol - ogies may have a significant effect on the metal contact. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the difference in doping concentration in the substrates with different morphologies and the test results of contact resistance are consistent with each other. Additionally, in the transport path of electrons between silicon and metal, the current flowing directly through the silver crystallites to the silver grid lines is the most influential transport mode. These direct contacts are mainly concentrated at the tips of the silicon pyramids, as there is no glass covering in this area [34]. The presence of pyramid tips in the textured structure increases direct transport and thus reduces contact resistivity. With the increase of acid polishing weight loss, the tip of the pyramid is gradually rounded, the uncovered area of the glass layer is gradually reduced, the existence of this transmission mode is reduced, and the contact resistivity is gradually increased. While alkali polishing directly flattens the tip of the pyramid, direct transmission is almost non-existent. In addition, thicker silicon nitride films deposited by PECVD due to planarized surfaces may also result in a reduction in the number of silver crystallites incorporated into the silicon. At the same time, the increased reflectivity of the polished topography slightly reduces the actual temperature during the high-temperature fast co- firing process, which may affect the formation of deep silver crystallites. Therefore, we believe that when metal firing is performed on the TOPCon structure, it is inevitable that the oxide layer is burnt through by the metal. This has a significant effect on the contact resistance   c, B  and is very dependent on the surface topography. In the practical fabrication of TOPCon cells, it may be necessary to have backside roughness to improve metal contact, even at the expense of passivation. 3.2.Effect of back surface topography on TOPCon solar cell efficiency In the TOPCon solar cell fabrication process, edge isolation and backside morphology modification after B diffusion are usually per - formed simultaneously. This requires that a good surface topography must be achieved based on the complete removal of the edge and backside B-diffusion PN junctions to achieve high parallel resistance, superior passivation characteristics, and Good contact characteristics with metal. Under the condition that the weight reduction meets the  Fig. 7.J 0, metal  of alkali polished, acid polished, and textured samples.   C. Guo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      edge isolation requirement (0.3 g), the TOPCon solar cell precursor samples J0 and iVoc we prepared are shown in Fig. 9. We can see that the iVoc of the alkali texturing, acid polishing, and alkali polishing samples are 713 mV, 717 mV, 720 mV, and J 0  are 23.03, 18.84, and 14.23fA/ cm 2 , which corresponds well with the test data of the double- sided symmetrical sample.J 0  seems to show a larger difference compared to the double-sided symmetrical structure sample, which may be due to the background doping concentration of the back structure of the solar cell and the influence of other process preparation processes. This shows that in terms of the passivation characteristics of solar cell precursors before printing metal contact, alkali polishing is better than acid etching and alkali texturing. From the electrical properties of the battery shown in Table 2, due to poor metal contact, alkali polishing has a large series resistance and a very low fill factor (80.86%), even if its opening voltage (710 mV) and current (41.32 mA/cm2) are improved, but the final battery efficiency (23.72%) drops significantly. The open voltage (701 mV) and short-circuit current(40.77 mA/cm 2 ) of the alkali texturing sample are the lowest, but its fill factor (83.52%) has a greater advantage and the efficiency(23.87%) is in the middle. The open voltage (706 mV), short-circuit current(41.05 mA/cm 2 ), and FF(82.99%) of the acid-polished sample are all in the middle, and the final efficiency (24.05%) is the highest. This indicates that for the currently used silver paste, the acid-polished surface can better balance the contradiction between the metal contact and surface passivation, and obtain higher conversion efficiency. But for the alkali-polished samples, the significant deterioration of the metal contact causes serious losses, which are difficult to make up for the increase in open voltage and short-circuit current brought about by the flat surface. It is difficult to obtain high efficiency due to poor passivation characteristics and the large current loss of alkali-textured samples. We also observed that compared with the iVoc of the precursor sample, the Voc of TOPCon solar cells decreased by 12 mV(Texturing sample), 11 mV(Acid polishing sample), and 10 mV (Alkali polishing sample), respectively. This reveals the difference in the electrical performance of solar cells with different morphologies due to the degradation introduced by metal recombination [42]. The influencing factors of short-circuit current are complex. The different carrier recombination of samples with different surface topography may be an important influencing factor. At the same time, there may also be differences in the metal contacts of samples with different morphologies, which may affect the carrier transport. Through the quantum efficiency test, we can simply analyze the loss mechanism of the short-circuit current. It can be observed from Fig. 10(a) that the differences in EQE and reflectivity brought about by different back surface topography are more reflected in the 900–1100 nm long- wavelength light [1,38]. This is because long-wavelength light needs  Fig. 8.Contact resistivity (a)  c,B (b)  c,P  of different morphologies.   Fig. 9.(a)iVoc and (b)J 0  of the precursor structure samples.

Guo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      to travel deeper into the silicon to be absorbed. When long-wavelength light is incident on the backside of the silicon substrate, the difference in the topography of the backside leads to a significant difference in the optical path. The low reflectivity of the textured sample allows more light to enter the heavily doped polysilicon, while the high reflectivity of the acid-polished and alkali-polished samples allows more incident light to be reflected into the substrate. This ultimately leads to a difference in near-infrared optical absorption, manifested as a decrease in EQE with increasing backside surface roughness. A more intuitive result can be seen from the analysis of the current loss mechanism in Fig. 10(b). The parasitic loss of the alkali-textured sample has a large absorption in the near-infrared band because the rough surface allows more long- wavelength light to enter the heavily doped polysilicon, resulting in greater free carrier absorption. The flat surface of the alkali-polished sample makes the long-wavelength light reflect back to the substrate and be absorbed again, thereby increasing the short-circuit current, but at the same time causing the front surface escape loss to increase. Acid- polished samples are also effective in reducing near-infrared parasitic absorption loss, but slightly worse than alkali-polished samples. Other optical losses are mainly related to metal shading, front surface blue light absorption, and ARC reflection. This is a problem that needs to be solved in future research. The optimization of the front selective emitter, metal grid lines, and anti-reflection film will further promote the improvement of solar cell efficiency. The above studies show that three different chemical etching methods can produce significant differences in post-diffusion edge isolation. Flatter surface topography, fewer surface defects, and dangling bonds can greatly improve the open-circuit voltage of solar cells. At the same time, it can also improve the reflection of long- wavelength light on the back surface to improve the absorption and reduce its entry into the heavily doped polysilicon to be recombined. A flatter surface will also cause a significant increase in the contact resistance on the backside of the solar cell, which will manifest as a huge difference in FF. Compared to the alkali-textured and alkali-polished samples, the acid-polished samples eliminated pyramidal spikes to achieve better passivation characteristics, while the roughened surface achieved better metal contact. Therefore, the contradiction between passivation and contact is better balanced, and the highest efficiency can be achieved. 4.Conclusion In summary, by finely controlling the etching process, the effects of different chemical etching methods and weight loss on the surface morphology, tunnel oxide/n +polysilicon passivation characteristics, and contact resistance were studied. Studies have shown that for textured surfaces, increasing the roundness of the pyramids (acid pol - ishing) and flattening the pyramids (alkaline polishing) both lead to a more uniform SiOx layer, which improves the passivation contact. With the increase of polishing weight loss, the passivation contact charac - teristics gradually improved (the metal contact J 0, metal  changes more significantly), and the contact characteristics gradually deteriorated. Under the same weight loss, the passivation performance of the acid- polished sample is always slightly worse than that of the alkali- polished sample, and its contact resistance is significantly better than that of the alkali-polished sample. The flat surface formed by alkali polishing caused severe contact resistance deterioration, which does not seem to be caused by the poor contact between the metal paste and polysilicon, but is more likely to be caused by the thickness of the tunnel oxide layer and the tailing doping concentration in the substrate. Alkali- polished samples can significantly improve the passivation effect and light absorption, but the significant reduction of FF makes the efficiency low. In this work, the acid polishing process can effectively achieve edge isolation, balance passivation (J 0  ~ 4.73fA/cm 2 , J 0, metal  ~ 67.26fA/ cm 2 , iVoc ~ 740 mV), and contact characteristics (  c, B  ~ 1.67m cm 2 ), the best average cell efficiency (24.05%) was achieved. Future research on matching surface topography with silver paste will facilitate further efficiency improvements.

It has been shown that partial shading substantially affects the performance of polycrystalline photovoltaic module (PPVM) and BPVMs. A comparison of the performance of PPVM and BPVMs under different partial shading conditions is presented in this paper. Experiments were conducted on polycrystalline and BPVM with 320 W and 395 W, respectively. Module per - formance is analyzed in terms of percentage power extraction, percentage power loss, and power extraction per square meter. A partial shading for the front and rear side of BPVM has been developed and the results are presented. Based on the results, the average loss due to frontside partial shading is 26% lower in BPVM than in polycrystalline.    1.Introduction The extensive use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases has polluted the environment which in turn promotes the development of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, tidal. Aside from its affordability, solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation has gained considerable attention because of subsidies from governments and innovative busi - ness models that have allowed prices to drop [1]. PV modules made from silicon have the largest market share of 95% among commercialized technologies [2]. In comparison to traditional PV modules, BPVM can perform better because solar irradiation is absorbed from both sides of the cells [3]. The installation of PV has attained an exponential increase and reached a total installed capacity of 402.5GWp by the end of 2017. In 2017, the contribution of PV systems was about only 2.14% of total electricity demand worldwide and its share keeps increasing [4]. By 2030, the total installed capacity of PV systems is expected to be be - tween 1760GWp and 2500GWp [5]. Over 90% of PV cells available in the current market are made up of Si crystalline (IEA, 2016). This can be categorized into the aluminum back surface field has a market share of 70% followed by the Passivated Emitter andRear Contact (PERC) / Passivated Emitter with Rear Locally Diffused Cells (PERL)/ Passivated Emitter Rear Totally Diffused- Cells (PERT) technologies by 20% [6]. The PPVM is composed of AL-BSF and the BPVM is prepared by PERC/ PERL/ PERT technologies. The BPVM has gained attraction because of light absorption occurring on the front and rear sides of the module. Polycrystalline cells collect the photons from the sunlight only from the front side of the module. In the BPVM, photons are collected on the front and rear sides of the module. A transparent back sheet allows partial sunlight to reach the module from the rear side as it is reflected from the ground surface. This phenomenon of bifacial cells can increase the energy yield and thereby reduction in the cost of energy is achiev - able [7]. Luque et al, has developed an experimental setup using a concentrator device to collect the incident and albedo light to improve the power generation. The results showed that the albedo light improved the output power by 50%. Because of higher energy density in the BPVM, it generates higher output power compared to the PPVM for the same area. Because of the higher energy yield, the BPVM has a lower payback period. The lifetime of the BPVM with is improved because of the lesser sign of degradation due to moisture, light-induced and po - tential induced degradation [8]. The main advantages of the BPVM are the lower operating temperature due to the increase in open-circuit voltage. By reducing parasitic absorption and increasing recombina - tion at the interface of the aluminum back surface field, losses are decreased. The absenteeism of metallization on the back surface of the cell lowers the infrared absorption and reduces the operating  *Corresponding author. E-mail address: dpwtce@gmail.com (D.

Therefore, the bifacial cells operate at a lower temperature compared to the polycrystalline cells, resulting in enhanced power output [9,10]. In the BPVM, the introduction of a glass back sheet improves the durability compared to the PPVM with glass back sheet module con - struction [11,12]. The glass-glass structured BPVMs reduce the oper - ating cost and therefore it is on the verge of emerging as a significant technology for electricity generation through solar energy. However, the performance of the BPVM relies on the module tilt, spacing and eleva - tion. Among bifacial and polycrystalline structures, the rear exposer is the most significant difference. In a polycrystalline solar cell, the back contact is coated with silver and aluminum as a spate layer. For the bifacial solar cell, the back contacts are fabricated in the shape of an open metallization grid. The presence of a metallization grid facilitates the solar cells absorbing irradiation from the rear surface. Depending on the installation, the BPVM can improve the output power by 20% compared to the PPVM. Recently, the cost difference of the bifacial and PPVMs has decreased significantly [13]. By 2028, the share of the BPVM is expected to reach 40%. The efficiency of bifacial cells is calculated by separately defining the rear and front side efficiencies [14]. The factors that affect the efficiency of the BPVM are installation parameters, irradiance components and mismatch effect. The occur - rence of inhomogeneous irradiance results in a mismatch effect, which affects the reliability of the power generation. When the mismatched cell is reverse biased and acts as a load. It dissipates power in the form of a heating effect and increases the operating temperature leading to delamination of encapsulated materials. Therefore, it is essential to compare the performance of the BPVM with the PPVM. The hot spot phenomenon can occur in a PV module when the reverse voltage across the PV module exceeds the breakdown voltage and large concentrated current concentrates in a limited area. The cells may be irreversibly damaged by the thermal breakdown. The occurrence of the mismatch effect in a BPVM can be categorized as the front-side and rear-side mismatch. The mismatch effect on the front-side of the module is caused by the passing cloud, nearby building or soiling. The mismatch effect on the front-side of the PPVM is similar to that on the BPVM. The occurrence of the mismatch effect on the front-side of the PPVM focuses on the reverse characteristics of the cell, shading ratio and influence of the bypass diode. The electrical and thermal performances of the BPVM differ with the rear-side irradiance under the same front-side shading condition. The rear-side mismatch is caused by the inhomogeneous irradiance because of the self-shading effect of the module and installation parameters such as the junction box on the rear side, mounting frame and bracket. The rear-side irradiance inhomogeneity plays a significant role in evaluating the power and reliability. Koen et al, has conducted a simulation study on the current - voltage characteristics of the BPVM on both sides. The results show that the 0.2% power loss was caused by inhomogeneous irradiance. The author found that the mismatch effect on the rear-side would not lead to hotspots, but it affects the reliability of the module. Several researchers have analyzed the influence of the inhomogeneous irradiance on the rear-side only through simulation studies. Therefore, it is essential to explore the inhomogeneous irradiance on the rear side by the field test [15]. Analysing the effects of front side irradiance and rear-side inhomo - geneous irradiance on BPVM performance is presented using ray tracing simulations with a cell-level electrical circuits model. A linear model for predicting the mismatch loss of BPVM has been developed in this study. Based on the model, mismatch losses have been discussed in a 3x3 bifacial PV array, thus illustrating their impact on overall system per - formance due to rear inhomogeneity [16]. A horizontal single-axis tracker (HSAT) and a fixed racking bifacial system are discussed. For different racking configurations, a shading factor and mismatch loss is provided, as well as a demonstration of the distance effect on model, which provides principles for further improving the mounting systems and determining accurate parameters for PVsyst modelling [17]. The irradiance mismatch can result from two factors: partial shading on the front side and inhomogeneous irradiance on the rear side. The perfor - mance of BPVM were investigated in this experimental study to study the effect of these two factors. Under different shading conditions, BPVM and PPVM were compared for the effect of front-side partial shading. A BPVM was analysed under certain typical installation conditions under the influence of rear-side inhomogeneous irradiance [18]. In shaded conditions, BPVM generates more power than mono-facial PV modules based on an analysis of power loss. Shaded areas, functioning status of bypass diode, and module temperature are considered in a modelling approach to predict the power of a bifacial PV module in a shaded environment. As a result, the BPVM has relatively low power loss as compared to the mono-facial PV module. The mathematical modelling of both the PV modules are shown in the below figure. The current source is parallelly connected with the diode is the equivalent circuit of the general solar PV module. In the given Fig. 1(a) represents the single diode model for the one bifacial PV module. In the diode modelling, f represents the front face of the PV cell and the r denotes the rear side of the bifacial cell. The Fig. 1(b) indicates the single diode equivalent cir - cuit of the mono-facial (polycrystalline) solar PV module. Both the equivalent circuits are developed and simulated in the MATLAB / SIMULINK platform to validate the experimental results [19]. An anal - ysis of BPVM is presented using a simulation model. A software tool has been developed for the application of this model, which has been tested on various relevant configurations (diffuse irradiation fraction, module height, module tilt, ground albedo). As simulation result shows, verti - cally mounted BPVM at higher latitudes can be expected to generate high annual energy yield than south-facing mono-facial modules [20]. The mathematical output current equations are given below for both the solar PV modules. The current equation of the BPVM is expressed as., I pv �( G front G STC �I mpp,n �K I T)(1� SR f 100))�( G rear G STC �I mpp,n �K I T) I sc (1� SR r 100))(1)  SR r � SD r A cell .100%(2) were, SR r  is the shading ratio on the concern PV module. The current equation of the PPVM is expressed as., I pv �I ph �I D [�exp( V pv �R s I pv A)�1]�[ V pv �I pv R s R sh ](3) From the literature survey only deals with the performance assess - ment of front side partial shading effect in the PPVM and BPVM. In some literature work relates the rear side partial shading effects in the BPVM. Still there is a lack of research in the consideration of combined shad - owing effect on both sides (front and rear). These shadowing scenarios may greatly affect the performance of the BPVM when compared with the PPVM respectively. Hence, in this present study, the various partial shading scenarios has been discussed to validate the performance of the polycrystalline and the bifacial PV module. The rear side shading con - ditions will be greatly decreasing the performance of the bifacial module to the polycrystalline module when compared with the front side shading cases. In this proposed work, mainly focus on the impact of the real-time rear side shading, both side shading cases with same location and different locations are compared with the conventional poly - crystalline module. Also, its performance is compared with the PPVM in terms of the percentage of power extraction, percentage power loss, power extraction per meter square. The activation of bypass diodes concern with the percentage of shading on the PV module is also dis - cussed in this study.  T.

An experiment was conducted to analyze the impact of partial shading on both modules. The partial shading effect is obtained using cardboard sheet to reduce the incident irradiation on the module. At the time of the experiment, the entire module was subjected to irradiation of 900 W/ m 2 . In the PPVM, a partial shading effect is created on the front side, whereas in the BPVM, it is created on the front and rear sides. To maximize the albedo effect, the surface beneath the BPVM is kept white to enhance the light reflection. The incident irradiation on the module was measured using a Meco 936 solar meter. For the different partial shading conditions, the voltage of the module and current are recorded. The wall mounted MPPT Smarten PWM solar charge controller rated as 24 V / 48 V & 50 A is used to validate the results taken by varying the rheostat. 3.Experimental procedure 3.1.1. Partial shading scenario In this study, the effectiveness of the polycrystalline and BPVMs is verified by comparing their performance under different partial shading conditions. The partial shading pattern is analyzed in terms of different shading ratios in the PPVM. The implementation of the partial shading scenario is shown in Fig. 3. The partial shading conditions considered for this study are shading on the polycrystalline and front side of the BPVM, shading only on the rear side of the BPVM, shading on the PPVM and identical shading patterns shading on the front and rear side with identical shading ratios and different pattern of shading on the front and rear side with different shading ratio. The different shading patterns considered for the study are row shading, column shading, single cell distributed shading and distributed short column shading. Fig. 4 illustrates the pictorial repre - sentation of the real time possibility of occurrence of partial shading conditions for both PPVM and BPVM. The occurrence of the shading ratio on the module considered for the study varies between 0% and 100%. The performance of the modules is analyzed in terms of the percentage of power extraction, percentage power loss and power extraction per meter square. 3.1.1.Case 1 For case 1, various shading patterns are considered with different shading ratios on the polycrystalline and front side of the BPVM, as shown in Fig. 5(ca- cn).

The results are presented in the form of a percentage of power extraction, percentage power loss and power extraction per meter square. 4.1.Case 1 In case 1, the shade is assumed to occur only on the front side of the PPVM and BPVM, as shown in Fig. 5. The rear side of the BPVM is considered to be unshaded. Fig. 9 shows the comparison of performance parameters and their results are shown in the Table 2. 4.1.1.Uniform irradiation condition In solar photovoltaic module, the 100% power extraction is possible only when the module receives 1000 W/m 2  irradiation level. Here the irradiation level is 900 W/m 2 . Therefore, the percentage of power extraction from the PV module is 90. For the uniform irradiation con - dition, the BPVM produces a power of 357 W compared to the PPVM of 288 W. Both the modules has the power extraction and power loss of 90% and 10% respectively. The BPVM has a higher power extraction of 208 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 167 W/m 2 . During the full irra - diation condition, the BPVM yielded better results because of the in - crease in the area of power extraction by the albedo on the rear side of the module. 4.1.2.Single module distributed shading In the single module distributed shading type – I, PV cell 1 is shaded with a shading ratio of 25% as shown in Fig. 5(b). Table 2 represents the results for the front side shade on both the modules. The BPVM and PPVM produces a maximum power of 238 W and 192 W and also has the similar power extraction and power loss of 60% and 40%. The BPVM has a higher power extraction of 138 W/m 2  because of the unshaded rear side compared to the PPVM of 112 W/m 2 . For the type- II shading PV cells 1 and 43 were shaded with a shading ratio of 25% as shown in Fig. 5(c). The maximum power of 119 W and  Fig. 5.Shading pattern on the PPVM and the front side of the BPVM: (ca) PV modules under uniform irradiation condition, (cb – cd) single module distributed shading condition type – I, II, and III, (ce) row shading, (cf & cg) short column shading type – I and II, (ch – ck) distributed short column shading – I, II, III and IV, (cl – cn) column shading type – I, II and III.  T. Hariharasudhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       96 W is produced by the BPVM and PPVM. The power extraction and power loss of 30% and 70% is produced by both the modules. The BPVM has a power extraction of 69 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 56 W/m 2 . Under the single module distributed shading type – III, PV cells 1, 43 and 63 are shaded with a shading ratio of 25% as shown in Fig. 5(d). The BPVM generates a maximum power of 277 W, followed by the PPVM of 216 W. The BPVM had percentage power extraction and percentage power loss of 70% and 30% followed by the PPVM by 68% and 33%. The BPVM has a power extraction of 161 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 126 W/m 2 . For the single module distributed shading types, the number of cells which are shaded varies in each shading type. If one cell in all strings is shaded, more output power is generated compared to one cell shaded in each string. 4.1.3.Row shading In row shading type – I, the PV cells 1, 24, 25, 48, 49 and 72 con - nected in the first row are subjected to shade with a shading ratio of 50% as shown in Fig. 5(e). The BPVM generates a maximum power of 196 W compared to PPVM by 144 W. The BPVM has improved the power extraction to 50% and reduce the power loss by 50%. Also, the BPVM has enhanced the power extraction to 114 W/m 2 . 4.1.4.Short column shading In the short column shading type – I, the PV cells 61, 62, 63 and 64 in the third string is subjected to shade with a shading ratio of 75% Fig. 5 (f). The BPVM produces a maximum power of 238 W in comparison with PPVM by 192 W. Because of the occurrence of similar shading pattern on the front surface of both the modules, the percentage power extraction and percentage power loss is obtained as 60% and 40% respectively. The BPVM has a maximum power extraction per meter square of 138 W/m 2  because of the power generation by the rear side. For the short column shading type – II, the PV cells 69, 70, 71 and 72 in the third string is subjected to shade with a shading ratio of 100% as shown in Fig. 5(g). The power developed from the BPVM is 238 W fol - lowed by the PPVM of 192 W. The percentage power extraction and percentage power loss of both the modules is 60% and 40% respectively. The BPVM has a power extraction per meter square of 138 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 112 W/m 2 . Here, the shading pattern on both modules are identical with a different shading ratio. Both the module has generated a similar maximum power and the variation in the shading ratio does not impact on the output power. 4.1.5.Distributed short column shading In the distributed short column shading type – I and II, the PV cells 1 & 2 in string 1, 25 & 26 in string 2 and 49 & 50 in the string 3 is subjected to shade with shading ratio of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% Fig. 5(h, i). The BPVM and PPVM produces a maximum power of 92 W and 72 W. The BBPVM and PPVM modules has a similar power extraction of 23% and  Fig. 6.Shading pattern on rear side of BPVM: (ca) PV modules under uniform irradiation condition, (cb – cd) single module distributed shading condition type – I, II, and III, (ce) row shading, (cf & cg) short column shading type – I and II, (ch – ck) distributed short column shading – I, II, III and IV, (cl – cn) column shading type – I, II and III.  T. Hariharasudhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       the power loss of 77% and 78% respectively. Also, the power extraction of BPVM is 53 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 42 W/m 2 . With the similar pattern and the variation in shading intensity does not has an impact on the output power of the modules. For the distributed short column shading type – III, the PV cells 1 to 7 in the string 1, 18 to 24 in string 2 and 25 to 31 in the string 3 are shaded with a shading ratio of 75% as shown in Fig. 5(j). The BPVM produces a maximum power of 119 W and PPVM of 96 W. Both the modules has percentage power extraction and percentage power loss of 30% and 70% respectively. Because of the ability to generate power on the rear side, the BPVM has a higher power extraction per meter square of 69 W/m 2 . Here, the output power decreases with an increase in the number of series-connected PV cells. In distributed short column shading type – IV, the PV cells connected in the bottom diagonal are shaded with a shading ratio of 50% as Fig. 5 (k). The BPVM and PPVM produces a maximum power of 196 W and 144 W. The BPVM has the highest power extraction of 50% and lowest power loss of 55%. The BPVM has a power extraction per meter square of 114 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 84 W/m 2 . Here, the output power of both the PV modules is increased compared to the distributed short column shading type- III because the number of series-connected PV cells varies with strings. Here, the number of shaded series cells is less compared to distributed short column shading type – III and therefore it produces more output power. 4.1.6.Column shading In column shading type – I, the series-connected PV cells 1 to 12 connected in the first column is shaded with a shading ratio of 50% as shown in Fig. 5(l). The BPVM produced a maximum power of 238 W, followed by the PPVM of 192 W. Both the modules have percentage power extraction and percentage power loss of 60% and 40% respec - tively. The BPVM has a power extraction of 138 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 112 W/m 2 . In column shading type – II, the PV cells 1 to 12 connected in the first column are shaded with a shading ratio of 10% as shown in Fig. 5(m). The BPVM produced a maximum power of 324 W, followed by the PPVM of 173 W. The BPVM had percentage power extraction and percentage power loss of 82% and 18% followed by the PPVM of 54% and 46% respectively. The BPVM had a power extraction per meter square of 188 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 101 W/m 2 . The output power decreases with the shading ratio of the series-connected PV cells in string 1. In column shading type – III, the PV cells 1 to 12 connected in the first column are shaded with a shading ratio of 5% as shown in Fig. 5(n). The BPVM produced a maximum power of 340 W followed by the PPVM of 182 W. The BPVM has generated 32% more power than the PPVM. The BPVM has a percentage power extraction of 86% and the power loss is reduced by 14%. The BPVM has extracted power per meter square of 95%. For the column shading conditions, cells 1 to 12 are shaded with  Fig. 7.Shading pattern on PPVM and both sides of BPVM: (ca) PV modules under uniform irradiation condition, (cb – cd) single module distributed shading condition type – I, II, and III, (ce) row shading, (cf & cg) short column shading type – I and II, (ch – ck) distributed short column shading – I, II, III and IV, (cl – cn) column shading type – I, II and III.

Hariharasudhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       different shading ratios, the output power increases with a reduction in the shading ratio. 4.2.Case 2 In case 2, the shade is assumed to occur only on the rear sides of the BPVM and the front side of both the modules is unshaded as shown in Fig. 6. Since the front side of the PPVM is unshaded it produces the maximum power, percentage power extraction and power loss of 288 W, 90% and 10% for all the shading conditions. Fig. 10 shows the com - parison of performance parameters and their results are recorded in the Table 3. 4.2.1.Uniform irradiation condition For the uniform irradiation condition, the both the module produces its maximum power of 357 W and 288 W as shown in Fig. 6(a). Also, obtained a similar power extraction and power loss of 90% and 10% respectively. The BPVM has a higher power extraction per meter square of 208 W/m 2  compared to the PPVM of 167 W/m 2 . The increase in power extraction is because of the increase in the area of power extraction by the albedo on the rear side of the module. 4.2.2.Single module distributed shading Under the single module distributed shading, type I - PV cell 1 is shaded, for type II – PV cells 1 and 43 is shaded, for type III - PV cells 1, 43 and 63 are shaded with a shading ratio of 25% as shown in Fig. 6(b -  Table 2 Results for the shading pattern on the front side of the polycrystalline and BPVM for case 1.

Under the column shading type – II and III, the series-connected PV cells 1 to 12 is shaded on the front side and PV cells 25 to 36 are shaded on the rear side with a shading ratio of 5% and 10% (Fig. 8(m,n)) respectively. For the column shading type- II, the BPVM and PPVM produces a maximum power of 292 W and 173 W. And, for the column shading type –III, the maximum power of 308 W and 182 W is produced by the BBVM and PPVM. The power extraction and power loss of both the modules are almost similar. In this study, the experimental results are validated with the simu - lated results by the equivalent circuits in the MATLAB/ SIMULINK platform. 4.5.Comparison of the performance of polycrystalline and BPVM under different partial shading patterns For the case 1, the occurrence of shade only on the front side of both the modules. The BPVM performs superior compared to PPVM higher power extraction and lower power loss. In the case 2, the occurrence of shade was only on the rear side of the BPVM. The PPVM produced the same maximum power for all shading patterns. Here, the PPVM gives better performance compared to BPVM. The BPVM has lost its advantage of higher power generation in this case. In case 3, the occurrence of a similar shade pattern was present on the front of the PPVM and both sides of the BPVM. The performance of the BPVM drops significantly compared to PPVM and also BPVM lost its advantages of rear-side generating power. For the case 4, the occurrence of a similar shading pattern on the front of the polycrystalline and BPVMs and a different shading pattern on the rear side of the BPVM. The performance of both the modules is identical to that of case 3. From the experimental results, it is observed that the BPVM yields superior performance under the shading conditions. However, if the shade occurs on the rear-side of the BPVM, its performance drops slightly. Meanwhile, if the shade occurs on both sides of the BPVM, it loses the advantage of delivering superior performance and behaves like a PPVM. Hence, care should be taken during the PV installation to avoid the occurrence of shade on the rear side. Attention can be given in the installation parameters such as the junction box on the rear side, mounting frame and bracket. 5.Conclusion This research investigates the impact of partial shading on the per - formances of PPVM and BPVM. It is possible for both PPVM and BPVM to exhibit partial shading on the front side, whereas BPVM can exhibit partial shading on the rear side as well. By comparing the average values for each type of shading it is identified that BPVM extracts 26% more power in the front side partial shading, 16% in rear side shading and 15% in both side partial shading when compared to polycrystalline. For the different partial shading cases BPVM generates higher power because of the arrangements to grab reflected solar energy on the rear side. There is almost no difference in performance between the PPVM and the bifacial under partial shading conditions when the rear side is partially shaded. For the front and rear side partial shading conditions, the BPVM losses its advantage of yielding more power compared to the PPVM.  \During the front side shading effect, the BPVM extracts more power than the PPVM. The BPVM extracts maximum power of 208 W per meter square area for case ca, whereas the PPVM extracts only 167 W.  \During the rear side shading effect, BPVM’s power extraction is greatly reduced for high rear side partial shading whereas it is lesser for low partial shading.  \During combined shading effect with identical shading location, the BPVM extracts maximum power of 179 W per meter square area for case cn, whereas the PPVM extracts only 106 W.  \During combined shading effect with different shading location, the BPVM extracts maximum power of 170 W per meter square area for case cm, whereas the PPVM extracts only 101 W. Further this study can be extended for various geographical loca - tions, fast changing environmental conditions, various tilt angle, and also with various heights. The bifacial modules can deliver better per - formance in higher latitude locations even during partial shading con - ditions. The partial shading performance assessment of bifacial PV modules can be analysed for medium sized and large sized power plants with the different interconnection patters such as Series-Parallel, Bridge Link, Honey Comb, and Total Cross Tied.

Our phosphorus-doped poly-Si/SiO x  passivated contact with SiN x  capping layer gave excellent surface passivation with a very low recombination current density (J 0_TOPCon ) of ~1 fA/cm 2  after a simulated firing treatment at ~770  � C without metallization. After screen-printed and fire- through metallization on n-TOPCon with ~13% metal coverage, metallized J 0_TOPCon  value increased to only ~5 fA/cm 2 . In addition, homogenous boron implanted emitter (~180 /) passivated with ALD Al 2 O 3  layer capped with PECVD SiN x /SiO x  double-layer antireflection (DLAR) coating gave excellent passivation with emitter recombination current density of ~12 fA/cm 2  prior to metallization. The industrial screen-printed, fire- through contacts with floating busbars on this boron emitter gave metallized emitter recombination current density of ~31 fA/cm 2 . This resulted in a low-cost industrial screen-printed n-type bifacial Si solar cell with 22.6% efficiency and 702 mV open-circuit voltage (V oc ).    1.Introduction SiO x /poly-Si (polycrystalline silicon) carrier-selective passivating contacts, such as tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), have become an active research area for next-generation industrial silicon solar cells due to the excellent surface passivation, elimination of diffusion into the bulk, no direct metal contact to absorber material, and ability to withstand high temperature [1–5]. An n-type TOPCon (n-TOPCon) is composed of a very thin tunnel oxide (SiO x ) capped with phosphorus doped n þ poly-Si. Several investigators have reported very low recombination current density (J 0 ) (<10 fA/cm 2 ) [6–10] for n-TOPCon structure with �1.5 nm SiO x  capped with n þ doped poly-Si. As a result, very high efficiency (>25.7%) small area R&D cells have been reported but with full area evaporated Ag on n-TOPCon on the rear [11]. However, to adapt TOPCon technology for industrial production of large-area Si solar cells, several challenges need to be overcome, including screen-printing induced shunting and degradation of J 0  of n-TOPCon with thin poly-Si [12], parasitic absorption in the doped poly-Si [13,14], single-side deposition of poly-Si [15], and throughput [16]. The poly-Si thickness needs to be adequate to prevent the pene - tration of the fire-through metal paste into the thin oxide and oxide/Si interface. This is essential for achieving the lowest metallized J 0  for the TOPCon layer. Recently few investigators have reported low metallized J 0  for fire through screen-printed contacts to n-TOPCon using thicker poly-Si layers, which resulted in cell efficiencies of 21–23.5% [8,12, 17–22]. However, thicker poly-Si increases parasitic absorption which decreases short circuit current [13,14]. Recently, Nandakumar et al. reported on reduced parasitic absorption when thick poly-Si layers are partially oxidized during deposition without hurting passivation and contact properties [23], resulting in a ~23.05% large area, screen-printed n-TOPCon bifacial cell. In addition, they used a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) tool to grow in-situ tunnel oxide and thick n þ poly-Si in a single step on one side only with very high deposition rate, which brings the TOPCon technology much closer to mass production. In spite of these encouraging results, there is limited quantitative understanding of J 0  contribution from each  *Corresponding author. E-mail address: yok6@mail.gatech.edu (Y.-W. Ok).

This paper reports on the fabrication as well as detailed analysis of such high efficiency commercial size bifacial cells with screen-printed metallization on both sides. In this paper, industrial size high efficiency fully screen-printed bifacial n-type solar cells were fabricated with ion-implanted homoge - neous front boron (B) emitter and rear n-TOPCon. A co-firing process was used to make screen-printed contacts to lightly doped B emitter and n-TOPCon simultaneously. The benefit of floating busbars was also quantitatively examined for the lightly doped implanted homogeneous B emitter by modeling, fabrication, and characterization of cells with five floating as well as fire-through busbars. 2.Experimental Fig. 1 shows the process flow and structure of the large-area (239 cm 2 ) n-type bifacial cells fabricated with an implanted B emitter on front and low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) grown n-TOPCon on rear side of 180   m thick 2 -cm n-type Cz wafers. Since LPCVD grows poly-Si on both sides of the wafer, we implemented a masking process to etch poly-Si from front side. After standard saw damage etching, texturing and cleaning, the wafers received B ion implantation on the front side with a dose of 1.2e15/cm 2  at 10 KeV ion energy fol - lowed by an annealing and oxidation process at high temperature (~1050  � C), which resulted in sheet resistance of 180 /. After the removal of oxide thermally grown during the implant anneal, a PECVD SiN x  was deposited on the front side as a mask to protect the emitter during back planarization and front poly-Si etching. A heated KOH treatment was used to planarize the back. After an acid clean and HF dip, a ~15 Å tunnel oxide layer was grown by nitric acid oxidation (NAO) at 100  � C for ~10 min [24], followed by 200 nm LPCVD n � poly-Si deposition at 580  � C with in-situ phosphorus doping. Next, a PECVD SiN x  masking layer was deposited on the back poly-Si, and then the front poly-Si was removed by wet etching in KOH solution. After that, both front and back SiN x  masks were removed by HF treatment. The samples were then annealed at 855  � C for poly-Si crystallization and dopant activation. The B emitter was then passivated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al 2 O 3  and PECVD SiN x /SiO x  stack while the back poly-Si was capped with ~700 Å thick PECVD SiN x  layer. For cells with non-floating busbars, 40   m wide 104 grid lines in combination with 600   m wide 5  Fig. 1.Process sequence and structure of the screen-printed bifacial n-type Si solar cell with front implanted boron emitter and rear tunnel oxide passivated contact.

Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               busbars were screen-printed on the B emitter using a fire through Ag/Al paste and single print. The screen grid opening was 35   m, resulting in fired grid linewidth of 40   m. Front side metallization with floating busbars (FB) was done using dual-print, where the grid fingers were screen-printed first using the fire-through Ag/Al paste first and then a fritless non-fire-through Ag paste was used to print the busbars. Next, 60   m wide 300 grid lines in combination with 600   m wide 5 busbars were screen-printed on the rear n-TOPCon using fire-through Ag paste and single print. Finally, all samples were co-fired in an industrial-style belt furnace with peak firing temperature of 770  � C. The two SiN x  masking steps employed in our cell fabrication process can be eliminated by the single side etching tool used in industrial setting. During the cell fabrication, symmetrical test structures of n-TOPCon and implanted B emitter were prepared to quantify their passivation properties and the impact of screen-printed metallization (Fig. 2). The symmetric p þ np þ test structures were passivated with thin Al 2 O 3  capped with PECVD SiN x /SiO x  on textured Si wafers to determine the J 0  of the implanted B emitter using the photoconductance decay (PCD) mea - surement technique proposed by Kane and Swanson [25]. Similarly, symmetric LPCVD grown n-TOPCon structures were prepared on planar Si wafers capped with SiN x  for the J 0  measurements. In order to quantify the effect of screen-printed fire-through metallization on recombination current density of our implanted B emitter (J 0e ) and rear n-TOPCon (J 0_TOPCon ), gridlines with different metal coverage were screen-printed only on one side of the symmetric structures. After the simulated con - tact firing, the excess printed metal was etched away in HCl:H 2 O 2 :H 2 O ¼1:1:1 solution, leaving only the embedded metal contact on the sur - face for the metallized J 0  measurements. 3.Results and discussion Table 1 shows the cell parameters from light I–V measurements when the cell is illuminated from the front side. Cells were measured in-house using the Fraunhofer ISE certificated reference cell. The fire-through busbar cells showed best cell efficiency of 22.1% with V oc  of 688 mV, J sc  of 40.1 mA/cm 2 , and FF of 80.0%. However, the best cell with floating busbars showed ~14 mV higher V oc , resulting in a V oc  of 702 mV and efficiency of ~22.6%. The efficiency range was 22.0–22.1% for non- floating busbar, and 22.4–22.6% for floating busbar cells. Both cells showed high J SC  (>40 mA/cm 2 ) due to high EQE, reduced shading from narrow lines, and SiO 2 /SiN x  two-layer AR coating on front. For the quantitative study of the effect of screen-printed fire-through metallization on recombination current density of our implanted B emitter and rear n-TOPCon, the above test structures with different metal fraction on one side (Fig. 2) were measured by the PCD tester with the light flashing on the no-metal side to avoid any shading effect. In addition, specific contact resistance was measured using TLM pattern on the same samples, resulting in 2 and 4 m-cm 2  values for the n-TOPCon and B emitter, respectively, supporting the excellent co-firing process for front and back metallization. Fig. 3(a) shows the measured total J 0  from the n-TOPCon test structures as a function of metal fraction on one side. The total measured J 0  of the test structures with different metal fractions (f) on one side can be expressed as TotalJ 0 ¼J 0 TOPConðnometalÞ þJ 0 TOPConðwithmetalfractionfÞ ¼J 0 TOPCon;pass þ�J 0 TOPCon;pass �ð1�fÞþJ 0 TOPCon;metal �f�¼�J 0 TOPCon;metal �J 0 TOPCon;pass ��fþ2J 0 TOPCon;pass   where J 0_TOPCon, pass  and J 0_TOPCon, metal  are the full area J 0  values for the un-metallized and metallized n-TOPCon. Fig. 3 (a) shows that without any metal, total J 0  (¼2 �J 0_TOPCon, pass ) of ~2 fA/cm 2  was achieved, which corresponds to a J 0_TOPCon, pass  of ~1 fA/cm 2 , indicating excellent passivation quality of our SiN x  capped LPCVD grown unmetallized n- TOPCon after simulated contact firing. However, total J 0_TOPCon  did show a slight increase with increased metal fraction (Fig. 3 (a)). From the intercept and slope of the linear fit to the experimental data in Fig. 3 (a) (y ¼29.3 x þ2.1), we obtained a J 0_TOPCon, metal  ~30 fA/cm 2  and J 0_TOPCon, pass  ~ 1.05 fA/cm 2  for the metallized and unmetallized n- TOPCon regions. This corresponds to a metallized J 0_TOPCon  of 5 fA/cm 2  (¼30 �13.5% þ1 �86.5%) for 13.5% metal coverage on the back, resulting from 60   m wide 300 grid lines and 600   m wide 5 busbars in this study. Identical study was conducted on B emitter test structures from which full area J 0e,metal  ¼~706 fA/cm 2  and J 0e,pass  ¼~12 fA/cm 2  were obtained for our 180 / implanted B emitter, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). This corresponds to a metallized J 0e  of 31 fA/cm 2  (¼706 �2.7% þ12 �97.3%) for 2.7% metal/Si contact fraction for floating busbars and  Table 1 Light I–V results of best screen-printed, large-area n-TOPCon bifacial cells with non-floating busbars (nFB) and floating busbars (FB).

Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               44 fA/cm 2  (¼706 �4.6% þ12 �95.4%) for non-floating busbars (4.6% metal fraction). From the measured cell J sc  and V oc , a total J 0  of 58 fA/ cm 2  was obtained (V OC ¼ kTq ln� J SC J 0 �). Finally, J 0_bulk  was calculated to be 22 fA/cm 2  by subtracting the metallized J 0e  (31 fA/cm 2 ) and metallized J 0_TOPCon  (5 fA/cm 2 ) from the total J 0  (58 fA/cm 2 ). This cell analysis reveals that the V OC  of 22.6% cell is limited by the recombination in the bulk and emitter because the metallized J 0  of our TOPCon layer is very small (~5 fA/cm 2 ). Table 2 summarizes all the J 0  components in our 22.6% efficient finished cell. Additional characterization and modeling was performed to improve the fundamental understanding of our 22.6% cell. We used the Sen - taurus 2D simulator for modeling which requires surface recombination velocities on the B emitter and n-TOPCon regions rather than J 0  values. Fig. 4 (a) shows the measured profile of our implanted B emitter with ~5 �10 18 /cm 3  surface concentration and junction depth of ~1.4   m. Fig. 4 (b) shows the calculated J 0e  as function of surface recombination velocity for this B emitter profile, obtained from Sentaurus simulation [26,27]. From Fig. 4 (b), a surface recombination velocity value of 448 cm/s was obtained for the unmetallized passivated emitter region, using the measured J 0e  ¼12 fA/cm 2  (Fig. 3(b)). Similarly, SRV of ~6.7 �10 4  cm/s was extracted (Fig. 4 (b)) for the metallized emitter region from the measured J 0e,metal  of 706 fA/cm 2  (Fig. 3(b)). Since the exact tunneling mechanism and tunneling parameters were not fully known for our TOPCon, we measured phosphorus in-diffusion profile in Si bulk by electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) technique and replaced the n-TOPCon region by this profile with an effective surface recombination velocity that produce a J 0  ¼5 fA/cm 2 , which is equal to the measured metallized J 0  value of the TOPCon. This profile is formed during the 855  � C n-TOPCon anneal, and has a junction depth of 0.06   m and a surface concentration of 4.7 �10 18  cm �3  (Fig. 5 (a)). Sentaurus model was used to generate the J 0  vs S curve for this profile (Fig. 5(b)) from which an effective hole SRV of 328 cm/s was extracted at the tunnel oxide/Si interface using the metallized J 0_TOPCon  value of 5 fA/cm 2 . This approach is similar to the one used by Chen et al. [28]. Finally, a complete Sen - taurus 2D model was built to match the 22.6% efficient screen-printed TOPCon solar cell using all the measured material and device parame - ters (contact area, shading area and contact resistance) and the extracted recombination velocities at the passivated and metallized emitter re - gions and the tunnel oxide/Si interface (Table 4 column 1). The modeled cell parameters matched very well with the measured cell light IV (LIV)  Table 2 Summary of recombination current density for each region of our 22.6% n- TOPCon cell.

In order to establish directions for further efficiency improvement, we extended the 2D Sentaurus modeling. Table 4 shows that a combination of selective emitter (30/180 /), increased bulk lifetime from 1 to 3 ms, and 100   m wide 14 floating busbars for multiwire application can raise the cell efficiency to ~ 24%. 4.Conclusions A fully screen-printed large area ~22.6% efficient bifacial n-type Si solar cell was fabricated with implanted lightly doped homogeneous B emitter (180 /) on the front and n-TOPCon on the back of a 2 -cm n- type Cz Si. SiN x  capped LPCVD grown 200 nm n  poly-Si on ~15 Å tunnel oxide produced unmetallized J 0  value of ~1 fA/cm 2  and metal - lized J 0  of ~5 fA/cm 2  with 13.5% metal coverage. Floating busbars on the front emitter gave ~14 mV increase in V OC  with ~0.5% efficiency enhancement due to reduced front metal/Si contact area on the lightly doped B emitter. Detailed analysis was performed to determine the J 0  component and interface recombination velocity of each region. Results indicated that the metallized J 0  of the lightly doped B emitter (J 0e  ~31 fA/cm 2 ) and ~1 ms bulk lifetime wafer (J 0_bulk  22 fA/cm 2 ) limited the voltage to 702 mV and cell efficiency to 22.6%. Model cal - culations also showed that a combination of B selective emitter, improved bulk lifetime and multiwire contacts on the front can raise the cell efficiency to ~24%.

It is found that the N 2 O/Ar flow ratios strongly affect the properties of SiO x  layer, such as deposition rate, the resistance of high temperature, passivation quality, etc., thus significantly affect the properties of polysilicon passivated contact structures and the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells. The deposition rate of SiO x  layer and contact resistivity of SiO x /poly-Si(n + )/SiNx:H structure decrease with the increases of Ar flow. However, there is an optimal N 2 O/Ar flow ratio to obtain the best passivation quality and the champion effi - ciency. The optimal flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar=5:2 is found, and obtain the optimum thickness of SiO x  and uniform polysilicon passivated contact. The highest minority carrier lifetime (  ) of 5751   s, highest implied open circuit voltage (iV oc ) of 741.3 mV, lowest single side recombination saturation current density(J 0 ) of 4.79 fA/cm 2 , contact resistivity(  contact ) of 2.23 m/cm 2  and champion efficiency of 25.06% are obtained at the flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar=5:2.    1.Introduction In recent years, tunnel oxide passivated contact structure solar cells (i.e. TOPCon) based on doped polysilicon (n + -poly-Si) layer and ultra- thin tunneling SiO x  layer are proved to be a promising technology for the next generation of highly efficient industrial silicon solar cells. It will replace the mainstream passivated emitter and back cell (PERC) and double-sided PERC +solar cell, thus attracting more and more attention [1–3]. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of lab-type POLO2 IBC and TOPCon cells are up to 26.1% or more [4,5]. A high quality tunneling SiO x  layer is essential to provide effective chemical passiv - ation and allow selective carrier transport through quantum tunneling and/or pinholes [6–13]. At present, the ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer can be prepared by such methods as wet chemical oxidation [6,14,15], high-temperature thermal oxidation [16–18], ozone oxidation [19,20], atomic layer deposition(ALD) [21,22], etc. However, the above methods are limited in their application in industry due to their shortcomings [16,23–25]. The ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer prepared by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) has high density, high temperature stability, and can realize the same tube preparation of oxide layer and amorphous silicon layer. However, the lifetime of quartz tube is short due to the existence of thermal stress between amorphous silicon and quartz tube, which greatly increases the manufacturing cost of the solar cells. Wet chemical oxidation, ozone oxidation and ALD require an additional step to separate preparation of the oxide layer from the doped amorphous silicon layer, which potentially increase the risk of contamination, in addition to requiring additional equipment [25]. Therefore, researchers are focusing on the plasma-assisted oxidation manufacturing method that combines the growth of ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer with the deposition of amorphous silicon layer at present [25–28]. The combination of ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  prepared by plasma-assisted N 2 O oxidation and n + -poly-Si layer obtained excellent iV oc  values as high as 730 mV and corresponding J 0  values as low as 4.3 fA/cm 2  [25]. Plasma-assisted N 2 O oxidation is the decomposition of N 2 O into free radicals such as NO*, O*, N* in a vacuum chamber by capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) PECVD method, then the O* react with silicon on the surface to form SiO x  under the electric field [29]. The remote plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RPECVD) process developed by Lucovsky and colleagues employs He/N 2 O remote radio frequency (rf) plasma to grow SiO x . It has been reported that SiO x  films deposited with He/N 2 O have fewer Si–OH defects than those deposited with He/O 2  [30]. In addition, remote plasma-assisted oxidation (RPAO)  *Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: huangjb@cs48.com (J. Huang), zhaozc@cs48.com (Z. Zhao).

The introduction of N or other impurities in the interface layer can further improve the electrical properties and thermal stability of poly-Si passivated contact [2]. The importance of He dilution in producing high quality SiO x  films by PECVD has been emphasized by several groups [35, 36]. Smith and Alimonda consider that a large excess of atomic O are critical for obtaining high-quality PECVD oxides and that particle for - mation can be effectively suppressed by using lower pressures or diluting the reactant inert gas (He or Ar) [37]. Substitution of He by Ar can increase the concentration of atomic O, in addition, mild Ar + bombardment during deposition may lead to greater Si–O–Si bond angle relaxation in the as-deposited film [38]. Therefore, the quality and chemical composition of this ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer can be controlled and optimized by introducing Ar and other inert gases into the process of plasma-assisted N 2 O oxidation, thus helping us to improve their electrical properties. In this paper, we present an ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer deposi - tion method, which introduced Ar into N 2 O and use plasma-assisted N 2 O/Ar oxidation (PANAO) method to prepare ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer. In addition, we combine the deposition of ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  films and doped amorphous silicon (n + -a-Si) films in a single PECVD chamber. This provide a simple, fast and clean method to fabricate polysilicon passivated contacts. Meanwhile, The control of deposition time, process gas flow ratio, deposition pressure, deposition temperature and deposition RF power allow us to control the chemical composition and deposition rate of the ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer. PECVD has a faster growth rate (i.e. >1 nm SiO x  was formed in 2 min by plasma-assisted N 2 O/Ar oxidation in this paper) than thermal oxidation methods (i.e. a 1.8 nm SiO x  was formed in ~20 min at 650  ◦ C by thermal oxidation of LPCVD [18]). In this work, the types of atoms and molecules excited by electrons during N 2 O/Ar plasma discharge are detected by in-situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and the relationship be - tween the emission intensities of O atoms and different N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios are investigated. The characteristics of ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  film are studied by full spectral ellipsometry, such as the relationship between the growth rate, uniformity of the SiO x  film with the flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar precursor. Subsequently, the relationship between doping concentration of SiO x /n + -poly-Si passivated contact structure and the flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar precursor are researched by electrochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) tester. We also have studied the relationship between the electrical performance and the flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar pre - cursor to obtain an optimal SiO x  layer to achieve highly performing passivated contacts. The results indicate that variations in the gas flow ratios can significantly change the atomic O concentration of the ultra-thin tunneling SiO x  layer, which affect the stability and electrical performance of the corresponding poly-Si passivated contacts. Finally, we have studied the effect of N 2 O/Ar flow ratio on conversion efficiency of TOPCon solar cells, and obtain the best efficiency. 2.Experimental methods N- type 158.75*158.75 mm 2  commercial Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafer (1–2 cm) with thickness of 170±10   m were used as passivation quality and contact resistivity test samples. N-type 182*182 mm 2  com - mercial Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafer (1–2 cm) with thickness of 150 ±10   m were used for the preparation of solar cell samples.The flow chart of experimental details was shown in Fig. 1. After a saw damage removal step, all samples were textured and then immersed in 10% KOH solution for alkaline polishing and cleaned by standard RCA solutions. The resulting polished wafer were used for SiO x  thickness test and passivation quality test. SiO x /a-Si (n + ) stacks were deposited at 480  ◦ C through a tube PECVD system (Hunan Red Solar Photoelectricity Sci - ence and Technology Co., Ltd.. N 2 O(99.9999%) and Ar(99.9999%) were used as precursor gases for SiO x  deposition. SiH 4 (99.9999%), Ar and PH 3  (5% diluted in Ar, 99.9999%) were used as precursor gases for a-Si (n + ) deposition). We had adjusted the N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratio over a wide range to ensure that the properties of the SiO x  interfacial layer meets the requirements of the passivated contact structure uniformity and thick - ness. After the approximate range of the optimal N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratio were identified, 7 different SiO x  layers were formed by modifying the gas flow ratio of N 2 O and Ar (in slm) with values of 5:0, 5:0.5, 5:1, 5:2, 5:5, 5:8 and 5:10, respectively. The deposition time, deposition pressure and deposition RF power were fixed at 120 s, 150 Pa and 9000 W respectively. Subsequently, about 120 nm a-Si(n + ) was deposited in the same chamber (deposition conditions: SiH 4 /Ar/PH 3 =1:5:1, time=900 s, pressure=150 Pa, temperature=480  ◦ C, RF power=10000 W). The thickness of SiO x  films deposited under different N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios  Fig. 1.Flowchart of experimental details and schematic diagram of passivated contact structure.   J. Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and thickness of a-Si(n + ) were measured by full spectral ellipsometry (Elitop ES01), as shown in Fig. 1(a). As the N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios were adjusted, the types of atoms and molecules excited by electrons in the N 2 O/Ar plasma were measured by an in-situ optical emission spectros - copy (OES, Horiba, iHR320). Both passivation quality and contact resistivity test samples prepared under the conditions of different N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios were subject to high temperature annealing processes at 920  ◦ C for 60 min. After the optimal gas flow ratio was obtained, the influence of different annealing temperatures (860  ◦ C/880  ◦ C/900  ◦ C/920  ◦ C/940  ◦ C) on the passivation quality were explored. Four-probe tester (Four Dimensions, Inc, 280SI) was used for studying the function between the sheet resistance (R sh ) and N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios and annealing temperatures on the SiO x / poly-Si(n + ) structure, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). For the measurement of minority lifetime (  ), implied open circuit voltage (iV oc ) and single side saturated recombination current density (J 0 ), The SiO x /poly-Si(n + )/ SiNx:H passivated contact layers were deposited sympathetically on both sides of silicon wafer, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). The values of   , iV oc  and J 0  were obtained by Quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC, Sinton WCT-120) at 1-Sun equivalent light intensity, and the excess carrier injection level was 1*10 15  cm �3 . Contact resistivity (  contact ) was extracted by the method of transmission line method (TLM, Pvtools, TLM-SCAN), The single-sided SiO x /poly-Si(n + )/SiN x :H structure was designed with 5 busbars and 236 fingers, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). The   contact  between metal and poly-Si(n + ) was calculated using the I–V data measured at different gap widths between two electrodes, by which the contribution from the poly-Si layer was removed, and the accurate contact resistivity could be obtained. An electrochemical capacitance- voltage (ECV, WEP Wafer Profile CVP21) was used to measure the dopant concentration profiles of the annealed c-Si/SiO x /poly-Si(n + ) structure samples. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Kinetics of plasma-assisted N 2 O/Ar oxidation(PANAO) SiO x  The average oxidation thickness of SiO x  is gradually decreased from 1.76 nm (N 2 O/Ar=5:0) to 0.82 nm (N 2 O/Ar=5:10) with the decrease of N 2 O/Ar flow ratio under the condition of constant N 2 O flow, as evi - denced in Fig. 2(a). This may be caused by the addition of Ar diluting the process gases and decreasing the concentration of N 2 O, resulting in a reduction of SiO x  thickness. In addition, it can also be seen from Fig. 2(a) that the deposition uniformity of SiO x  is gradually improved (the thickness range of SiO x  decreases from 0.55 nm to 0.17 nm) after adding the Ar into N 2 O. The effects of total pressure and deposition temperature on the deposition thickness of SiO x  are shown in Fig. 2(b). The deposi - tion thickness increases with the increase of pressure from 100 Pa to 350 Pa at all temperatures, but the deposition rate become slower at higher pressure, which may be due to the increase of collision frequency be - tween Ar + and N 2 O, thus reducing Ar + energy and the yield of O atoms. From Fig. 2 (c), We find that the thickness of SiO x  formed by PANAO growths extremely fast at the first tens of seconds, but then gradually decreases with the extension of time until it reaches the self-saturated thickness, which is consistent with the description in literature [25]. In addition, with the increases of RF power, the growth rate is also accelerated, and the self-saturation thickness increases with the increase of RF power. This can be attributed to increasing RF power provides high energy ionized oxygen atoms to penetrate deeper in the SiO x , both of which contributes to increasing SiO x  saturation thickness [25]. Fig. 3 shows the spectra of the in-situ OES under the condition of 480  ◦ C, 150 Pa and 9000 W RF power with different N 2 O/Ar flow ratios. Many narrow Ar* emission lines are observed in the near infrared be - tween 700 and 900 nm, corresponding to the 3p 5 4p 3p 5 4s transition [39], as denoted by the asterisks in Fig. 3(a). The intensity of Ar* emission lines increase with the increase of Ar flow.

J. Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3p 3 P3s 3 S transitions respectively [40], as shown in Fig. 3(a). It can be proved from Fig. 3(b) that when N 2 O/Ar�5:2, the intensity of atomic O emission lines at 777 nm and 844 nm gradually increase with the decrease of N 2 O/Ar flow ratio. When N 2 O/Ar flow ratio reaches to 5:2, the intensity of atomic O emission lines reach the maximum value, indicating the highest concentration of atomic O has obtained at this flow ratio [29]. As the N 2 O/Ar flow ratio continues decreasing, the in - tensity of atomic O emission line begins to decrease, which may be related to the decrease of atomic O concentration caused by the exces - sive dilution of N 2 O by Ar. Since N 2 O dissociation in a N 2 O plasma discharge occurs via electron impact [41–43]:  N 2 O þe � N 2  þO ( 3 P)                                                                 (1) The Ar metastable state (Ar*) may provide an additional way for the dissociation of N 2 O and the generation of atomic O in N 2 O/Ar plasma. The addition of Ar makes the dissociation of N 2 O occur via Penning reactions with Ar* [38]:  N 2 O þAr* N 2 (B 3 ∏ g ) þO( 3 P) þAr                                               (2) Due to the existence of this reaction, the atomic O yield by plasma- assisted N 2 O/Ar oxidation will be higher than that of plasma-assisted N 2 O oxidation under appropriate N 2 O/Ar flow ratio. Therefore, it can be explained that the intensity of O emission line increases with the decrease of N 2 O/Ar flow ratio when N 2 O/Ar�5:2 in Fig. 3(b). When the flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar reaches to 5:2, the dissociation of N 2 O is basically completed and the concentration of O atom reaches the maximum value. Meanwhile, the intensity of atomic O emission line reaches the maximum. Further increase of Ar flow can not increase the atomic O yield, but it will dilute the process gases and lead to the decrease of atomic O concentration, so the intensity of atomic O emission line gradually decreased when N 2 O/Ar�×5:2. 3.2.Influences of PANAO SiO x  on doping profiles The doping profiles, which is strongly influenced by the SiO x  interfacial layer, is essential to achieve high performing polysilicon passivated contacts [44–46]. Fig. 4(a) shows the doping profiles (measured by ECV) based on PANAO SiO x /poly-Si(n þ ) passivated con - tact structures (using a fixed N 2 O flow of 5 slm) with different N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios. A constant phosphorus doping level of ~5�10 20  cm �3  are observed in the poly-Si layer at 920  � C annealing temperature for all samples, including the reference sample of plasma-assisted N 2 O oxida - tion(PANO) SiO x  (N 2 O/Ar¼5:0). However, it is interesting to note that the doping levels within the crystalline silicon substrates are different for samples with the various SiO x  layers prepared by different N 2 O/Ar flow ratios. The shallowest doping depth is found in the sample of PANO SiO x , and with the decreasing of N 2 O/Ar flow ratios, the doping depth gradually increases, the deepest doping depth is obtained when N 2 O/Ar¼5:10. This may be caused by (1) the gradually decreasing flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar reduces the thickness of SiO x  layer (from 1.76 nm to 0.82 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(a)), which leads to the decrease of its ability to prevent phosphorus diffusion [47]; (2) The decrease of O concen - tration leads to the quality of SiO x  layer decreases, as shown in Fig. 3(b), and it also may leads to the increase of defects in SiO x  film, thus reducing the blocking ability of phosphorus diffusion in SiO x  film. In Fig. 4 (b), it can be found that the sheet resistances (R sh ) measured by four probes tester decreases with the increase of Ar flow. The lowest R sh  of 42.04 / is obtained when the N 2 O/Ar¼5:10 (the thickness of SiO x  is 0.82 nm), and the highest R sh  of 53.3 / is obtained from a sample of PANO SiO x  (N 2 O/Ar¼5:0, the thickness of SiO x  is 1.76 nm). The decrease of R sh  is mainly attributed to the internal diffusion of phosphorus, and as the phosphorus diffuse deeper into the silicon substrate, the lower R sh  is obtained. In addition, it also can be found from Fig. 4 (b) that the addition of Ar can significantly improve the uniformity of R sh  distribu - tion, which may be the addition of Ar improves the uniformity of PANAO SiO x  (as shown in Fig. 2), so that its internal diffusion can be consistent. We conclude that PANAO SiO x  (~1.24 nm) at an appropriate N 2 O/Ar flow ratio (N 2 O/Ar ¼5:2) can not only form a strong phosphorus diffusion barrier, but also can form an appropriate SiO x  thickness that benefit carrier transporting. This may be caused by following reasons: 1) The addition of Ar will increase the concentration of atomic O, so the Si–O–Si bond absorption peak in SiO x  is stronger under the flow ratio of  Fig. 3.(a) In-situ OES spectra of different N 2 O/Ar flow ratio at 480  � C, 150 Pa and 9000 W RF power; (b)The function between the N 2 O/Ar flow ratios and the intensity of atomic O emission lines at 777 nm and 844 nm.  J. Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    N 2 O/Ar =5:2 than that of flow ratios, and the stoichiometric configu - ration is close to SiO 2  [37–39], thus the high temperature resistance ability can be enhanced. 2) N or other impurities may be introduced into the SiO x  layer to improve the electrical properties and thermal stability of the poly-Si passivated contact [2,44]. The doping concentration and R sh  of the samples with N 2 O/Ar =5:2 flow ratio are further studied as a function of annealing temperatures, as shown in Fig. 5. The R sh  slightly decreases from 64.63 / to 49.43 / when the annealing temperature increases from 860  ◦ C to 920  ◦ C, but the R sh  drops sharply to 26.76 / when the annealing temperature rise to 940  ◦ C. This is mainly because the fact that when the annealing temperature ≤920  ◦ C, the PANAO SiO x  can effectively prevent the diffusion of phosphorus atoms into the silicon substrate. The reasons of R sh  declining slightly are: 1) the phosphorus doping concentration in poly-Si increase from 1.8×10 20  cm �3  at 860  ◦ C to 5.1×10 20  cm �3  at 920  ◦ C. The increase of phosphorus doping concentration is related to the increasing of annealing temperature which increasing the activation of phosphorus atoms. 2) Internal diffusion of phosphorus atoms lead to a decrease of R sh  (doping profiles at 900  ◦ C and 920  ◦ C in Fig. 5(a)). When the annealing temperature reached to 940  ◦ C or above, the PANAO SiO x  layer no longer acts as a good diffusion barrier for phosphorus atoms. We believe that more pinholes are generated in the PANAO SiO x  layer and a large degree of film break-up has occurred at this temperature, similar to the break-up phenomenon observed in chemical silicon oxide [45], resulting in the ECV doping profiles at 940  ◦ C as shown in Fig. 5(a). Phosphorus atoms penetrate the PANAO SiO x  and diffuse into silicon substrate in large quantities, leading to the increase of recombination center in silicon substrate, finally resulting in a sharp decline of R sh  and poor passivation quality. This indicates that there is an optimal annealing temperature for the PANAO SiO x  layer to achieve a balance between passivation quality and carrier transport. 3.3.Effects of PANAO SiO x  on passivation quality Fig. 6 shows the electrical properties such as minority lifetime (  ), implied open circuit voltage (iV oc ), single-side saturated recombination current density (J 0 ) and contact resistivity (  contact ) of poly-Si passivated contact structures with PANAO SiO x  layers prepared by 7 different N 2 O/ Ar flow ratios as described in Section 3.2. The   , iV oc  and J 0  values are studied as a function of N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratio with the c-Si/SiO x /Poly-Si (n + ) structures before SiN x :H deposition, after SiN x :H deposition, after sintering and after dark annealing, as shown in Fig. 6(a) (b) (c). For the c-Si/SiO x /Poly-Si(n + ) passivated contact structures after high tempera - ture annealing (before SiN x :H deposition on both sides), as shown in Fig. 6 (a), The highest   ( 2881   s), iV oc (724.9 mV) and lowest J 0  (7.11 fA/cm 2 ) are obtained in the sample of N 2 O/Ar=5:2 flow ratio The in - crease of Ar flow leads to the decrease of iV oc  and the increase of J 0 . When N 2 O/Ar=5:10 flow ratio, the lowest    and iV oc  and the highest J 0  are obtained. The highest   , iV oc  values and the lowest J 0  values of the c- Si/SiO x /Poly-Si(n + ) passivated contact samples after dark annealing are obtained in the N 2 O/Ar=5:2 samples(  =5751  s, iV oc  =741.3 mV, J 0 =4.79 fA/cm 2 ). The above results caused by the fact that the thickness of the PANAO SiO x  film decreases with the increase of Ar flow when N 2 O/Ar≤5:2 (as shown in Fig. 2), but the addition of Ar will increase the concentration of atomic O (as shown in Fig. 3), which may lead to the formation of SiO x  closer to the stoichiometric configuration of SiO 2 . This PANAO SiO x  film contained more Si 4+ component, and higher Si 4+ component may lead to lower interfacial defect state, so the passivation quality is better [18]. Therefore, there are more stable chemical struc - ture and passivation quality under the condition of N 2 O/Ar=5:2 flow ratio, resulting in higher    and iV oc  values. However, the thickness of PANAO SiO x  layer decreases to less than 1 nm with the increasing of Ar flow ratio when N 2 O/Ar >5:2 flow ratio, which leads to the decrease of  Fig. 4.(a) Doping profiles and (b) R sh  distribution of SiO x /poly-Si(n + ) passivated contact structure at different N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios.

Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    its ability to prevent the phosphorus diffusion into the silicon substrate. As a result, phosphorus atoms act as the composite center in silicon substrate which decrease the passivation quality. In addition, the bombardment effect of Ar  + on PANAO SiO x  film is also enhanced as the Ar flow increased, which leading to the increase of defects in PANAO SiO x  film, thus degenerating the passivation quality. The    and iV oc  values of the samples with the shallowest doping profile of PANO SiO x  after dark annealing are 4000   s and 729.8 mV, respectively. The possible reasons is: in the process of PANO, there are lower atomic O concentration than PANAO process, which lead to interfacial defects in SiO x  layer and therefor resulting the decrease of chemical passivation quality. The    and iV oc  values of PANAO SiO x  sample with N 2 O/Ar=5:10 after dark annealing are 2516   s and 722.8 mV, respectively. The possible reasons for the lower    and iV oc  values are as follows: 1) the decrease of N 2 O/Ar flow ratio leads to the decrease of N 2 O concentra - tion and the decrease of O atom concentration per unit volume, which makes the thickness of PANAO SiO x  thinner and thinner, and the increasing of defects in the PANAO SiO x  film lead to the decreasing of chemical passivation quality. 2) The increase of Ar flow result in the increasing of pinhole density and defects density in PANAO SiO x  film, and deteriorating film density, which may originated from the increasing of Ar + bombardment in the process of plasma deposition (Ar atomic emission intensity was increased as the Ar flow increased, as shown in Fig. 2), thus resulting in a decline in its ability to prevent the phosphorus diffusion, as a result, there are more impurities penetrated into the silicon substrate, which lead to the increasing of recombination center, and the decreasing of passivation quality. We also have to ensure that the low   contact  value is capable of se - lective carrier transport through the PANAO SiO x  tunnel layer after we have evaluated the quality of passivation contact by   , iV oc  and J 0  values. In this work, TLM is used to test the contact resistivity value to evaluate the carrier transmission characteristics (effective contact re - sistivity   contact ), as shown in Fig. 6(d). For PANAO SiO x /Poly-Si(n + ) passivated contact, the average contact resistivity gradually decreases with the decrease of the N 2 O/Ar flow ratio.   contact  decrease from 8.88 mcm 2  (PANO SiO x ) to 1.09 mcm 2  (PANAO SiO x  of N 2 O/Ar=5:10), which may be due to the deeper penetration of phosphorus into the silicon substrate, resulting in better metal contact and higher carrier transport efficiency. However, this can also have an adverse effect on the recombination current in contact with the nonmetallic area. In addition, the thicker SiO x  layer may also lead to higher contact resistivity. Although lower contact resistivity can lead to better metal contact, it may lead to the decline of contact passivation quality in the nonmetallic area, so we should find a balance between   contact  and passivation quality [48]. At present, the average contact resistivity of PANAO SiO x /Poly-Si(n + ) passivated contact prepared under the N 2 O/Ar=5:2 flow ratio is 2.23 mcm 2 , it can achieve both excellent passivation quality and low contact resistivity which can meet the requirements for the preparation of high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells. The best PANAO SiO x  deposition results are obtained under the condition of N 2 O/Ar=5:2 based on the results of    (5750   s), iV oc  (741.3 mV), J 0  (4.79 fA/cm 2 ) and contact resistivity   contact  (2.23 mcm 2 ). In addition, the electrical properties of PANAO SiO x  samples with N 2 O/Ar =5:2 are further investigated as a function of annealing tem - peratures, as shown in Fig. 7. The relationship between the   , iV oc  and J 0  with annealing temperature of SiO x /poly-Si(n + ) passivated contact structure before SiN x :H deposition, after SiN x :H deposition, after sin - tering and after dark annealing (N 2 O flow was fixed at 5 slm) are tested respectively. It can be found that the values of    and iV oc  increase and the values of J 0  decrease as the increase of annealing temperature when the temperature(T)≤920  ◦ C. The best passivation quality after dark annealing is achieved at 920  ◦ C(  =5750   s, iV oc =741.3 mV and J 0 =4.79 fA/cm 2 ). We suggest that the following aspects will be considered as the reason to explained above phenomenon: 1) the chemical passivating improvement of interface SiO x  and the increase of annealing temperature enhance the absorption of impurities [18,49]; 2) The formation of positive fixed charges (Q tot ) at higher temperatures reduces the surface recombination of excess carriers (by repelling holes from the surface). The higher the temperature, the higher fixed charge is formed [50]; 3) An appropriate internal diffusion profile can achieve  Fig. 6.The (a)   , (b) iV oc , (c) J 0  and (d)   contact  of PANAO SiO x /poly-Si(n + ) passivated contact structures prepared by different N 2 O/Ar gas flow ratios at an annealing temperature of 920  ◦ C. Tests are conducted before and after deposition of SiN x :H, after sintering and dark annealing.  J. Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    excellent surface passivation [25]; 4) The increase of the phosphorus doping concentration in the poly-Si layer plays a major role with an increased field effect passivation that impact the lifetime, iV oc  and J 0  and this also explain the reduction of the contact resistivity. Si–O bond will be damaged when the annealing temperature is higher than 920  ◦ C, resulting in anoxic defects. The SiO x  layer may also damaged during high-temperature annealing, resulting in a sharp decline in passivation quality. We attribute this behavior to the fact that the pinhole density of the SiO x  layer increases sharply or SiO x  film breaks at a higher annealing temperature, which leads to severe internal diffusion of phosphorus. As shown in Fig. 5(a), phosphorus atoms penetrate SiO x  and diffuse into the silicon substrate in large numbers, resulting in the increase of potential recombination centers in the silicon substrate and the decrease of chemical passivating effect. The above reasons deteriorate the passiv - ation quality sharply. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 6(d) that the contact resistivity decreases with the increase of annealing temperatur, which is mainly related to the internal diffusion of phosphorus [18,25]. 3.4.Effects of PANAO SiO x  on electrical performance of TOPCon solar cells We have prepared PANAO SiO x  and its corresponding TOPCon solar cells under different N 2 O/Ar flow ratios as above, the electrical perfor - mance are shown in Table 1. It can be found that the average conversion efficiency increases first and then decreases with the increase of Ar flow. The average conversion efficiency reaches to the highest 24.81% under the condition of N 2 O/Ar=5:2, which is mainly attributed to the increase of open circuit voltage (V oc ) and filling factor (FF), which reach to 0.7092 V and 84.45, respectively. The increase of V oc  and FF is mainly related to the improvement of passivation quality and the decrease of contact resistivity, as described in Section 3.3. In addition, under the condition of N 2 O/Ar=5:2, we also obtain the champion efficiency of 25.06%. The specific electrical parameters are V oc =0.7132 V, I sc =13.7239 A, FF=84.55, as shown in Fig. 8.

We found that decreasing the N 2 O/Ar flow ratios from 5:0 to 5:2 can significantly improve the atomic O concentration during the PANAO SiO x  film deposition process. Thus the stoichiometric configuration of prepared SiO x  film was closed to SiO 2 , and the high temperature resis - tance was enhanced. For a precise control of the thickness of such thin SiO x  interfacial layers, a higher Ar flow was beneficial as it lowers the deposition rate. We found that a chemically stable, uniform and opti - mum thickness of SiO x  could be achieved by using gas flow ratio of N 2 O/ Ar⎩5:2. The highest    and iV oc  with 5751   s and 741.3 mV and lowest J 0  and low   contact  with 4.79 fA/cm 2  and 2.23 m/cm 2  and champion ef - ficiency of 25.06% were obtained at the flow ratio of N 2 O/Ar⎩5:2. It was expected that by further optimising the doping process, the annealing condition and the hydrogenation step, excellent PANAO SiO x  based poly-Si passivated contacts and efficiency of TOPCon solar cells could be achieved.

The environmental impact of PERC modules requires life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to analyze. The SimaPro software was used to calculate the envi - ronmental impacts, such as global warming potential (GWP), human toxicity potential – cancer effects (HTP-CE), human toxicity potential-non-cancer effects (HTP-nCE), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEcP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEuP) and abiotic depletion potential (ADP) of mono-facial and bifacial (dual-glass encapsulation and transparent back-sheet encapsulation) PERC modules prepared using 158.75 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm silicon wafers. The rear side gain of a bifacial module increases its electricity generation in the Use stage, and thereby making bifacial module achieve better environmental performance than mono-facial module. In order to improve the rear side gain of bifacial module, it is usually necessary to select an appropriate ground reflective material in system design. The LCA results show that the waterproof membrane TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) is a very good choice, and white gravel and grassland can also be considered in landscape design point of view. Whether to choose dual-glass encapsulation or transparent back-sheet encapsulation, has little effect on the overall environmental impact of bifacial modules. In addition, adding recycling in the photovoltaic industry chain can significantly reduce the overall environmental impact of photovoltaic modules, especially in the indicators such as ADP, HTP-CE and FEuP.    1.Introduction According to the statistics of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Photovoltaic Power Systems Program (PVPS), as of 2019, the global cumulative installed capacity of photovoltaics (PV) has exceeded 620 GWp [1]. In the global energy supply system, PV electricity generation contributes approximately 3% of the electricity supply. Among them, silicon modules, including multi-crystalline Si and mono-crystalline Si, account for 95% of the market share [2]. “High photoelectric conversion efficiency” and “low production cost” have always been the goals pursued by the PV manufacturing in - dustry. Among them, improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of cells and modules can reduce the expenditure of photovoltaic elec - tricity generation systems in the balance of system (BOS), such as in - verters, brackets and others, thereby, achieving the purpose of reducing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Therefore, high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells and their modules have become the first choice in the PV market. ITRPV Roadmap 2020 (11th Edition) shows that higher-efficiency passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) solar cell (module) has accounted for 69% market share in 2019, and will be market mainstream in coming years [3]. The average cell efficiency of the production lines of first-echelon companies in China 2019 has reached 22.5%, while the average efficiency of the production lines of general companies has reached about 22% [4]. In addition to the update of solar cell technology, there is also a trend toward using larger-size silicon wafers. The early single crystalline sili - con wafer was generally a smaller size of 125 mm with chamfers. Silicon wafer (M0 type) with a side length of 156 mm appeared since the year of 2012, with larger chamfers and a duty ratio of 98.18%. The duty ratio defines the ratio of the actual area of silicon wafers to the square area formed by the length of the silicon wafer edges. This made the mono- crystalline silicon modules have larger white space compared with the  *Corresponding author.

Therefore, although mono silicon solar cell has higher cell efficiency than poly silicon solar cells, the white space prevents it from showing obvious advantages in module power. However, removing the chamfer of mono-crystalline silicon wafer means greater material loss during cutting and higher cost. Thence, polycrystalline silicon modules occupied the mainstream posi - tion at that stage. In 2015, relying on the demand for high-quality silicon wafers, such as for PERC solar cells, monocrystalline silicon wafers received renewed attention. The so-called M2 type wafer, with a side length of 156.75 mm and a diagonal of 210 mm, began to be used. The chamfer was relatively small, and the duty ratio reached 99.43%, which reduced the white space of monocrystalline silicon modules and improved the module power. In 2017, the National Energy Administration of China put for - ward the PV module leader plan, which improved the access re - quirements for polysilicon modules to manufacturing. At that time, polysilicon was only made into back surface field (BSF) modules, whose cell efficiency was difficult to improve. Therefore, manufacturers switched to using slightly larger silicon wafers to increase the module power, without changing the 60-cell package. As a result, the size of silicon wafers was getting bigger and bigger, with sizes such as M2 (156.75 mm) and M3 (158.75 mm) appearing and becoming the main - stream. In 2019, LONGi launched the M6 (166 mm) wafer with a duty ratio of 99.49% and ZHONGHUAN launched the M12 (210 mm) wafer with a duty ratio of 99.99%. In terms of economic calculation, larger silicon wafers would have lower LCOE [5], but in terms of environ - mental impact, there is no analysis and comparison yet. Since the PERC structure can be easily prepared as a bifacial solar cell [6], in order to satisfy the collection for rear side yield, the traditional back-sheet was replaced with glass or transparent back-sheet. In different installation scenarios, the dual-glass bifacial modules obtain different rear side yield due to the different reflectivity of the ground materials. According to data collected from demonstration bases of LONGi, bifacial module yields 7–25% more than mono-facial modules based on different ground conditions [7]. This brings up the question: When designing the installation system of bifacial modules, what kind of design scheme can be selected to increase the total electricity generation as well as reduce the overall environmental impact? With the arrival of large-scale decommissioning of photovoltaic modules, discussions on module recycling have also been frequently brought up recently [8,9]. Currently, both Methodology Guidelines on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Photovoltaic [10] created by IEA PVPS Task 12 and Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) of photo - voltaic modules [11] recommend using landfill model in End-of-life stage. However, the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) direc - tive (EU Parliament 2012) prohibits the incineration or landfilling of spent PV modules [12]. In 2019, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China subsidizes a National Key R&D Program called Complete Sets of Technology and Equipment for Recycling of Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Modules [13]. With the gradual expansion of the scale of decom - missioned modules, the recycling of crystalline silicon modules will formally join the photovoltaic industry chain in the near future. The environmental impact of PERC modules needs to be evaluated using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). There are currently only 2 LCA research papers on PERC modules. M. M. Lunardi et al. compared the environmental impact of BSF and PERC modules made of upgraded metallurgical silicon (UMG-Si), solar (SGS) and electronic grade silicon (EGS) [14]. W. Luo et al. compared the environmental impact of BSF and PERC modules made of multi-crystalline silicon wafers [15]. But neither of them discussed the above issues. In this article, LCA of PERC mono-facial and bifacial modules pre - pared by 158.75 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm size of silicon wafers were compared, using the actual production data in China of 2019 and 2020 for modeling. Also, a comparative analysis was done for the selection of different ground conditions. And according to the recyclable ratio of each component in the PV module, the recycling and municipal landfill in the End-of-life stage were compared. The choice of dual-glass package or transparent back-sheet package of bifacial module has been debated for a long time. This article analyzes and compares their environmental impacts. Environmental impact category indicators of global warming potential (GWP), human toxicity potential – cancer effects (HTP-CE), human toxicity potential-non-cancer effects (HTP-nCE), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEcP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEuP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP) and energy return on invest - ment (EROI) were considered. 2.Materials and methods The basic information of PERC solar modules was listed in Table 1. “158-MF (60)"" means that the module was mono-facial (BF for bifacial) and was made up of 60 solar cells whose wafer size was 158.75 mm. The LCA study was carried out follow standard ISO 14040–14,044. The system boundary was divided into four stages: Production, Instal - lation, Use and End-of-life, as shown in Fig. 1. The balance-of-system (BOS) components, such as inverters, cables and concrete, were excluded. The Production Stage includes raw material acquisition and pre-processing, raw material transportation, and the module fabrication. The life cycle inventory of module fabrication, which is shown in Table 2, came from manufacturing line of solar cells and modules of China’s leading enterprise through questionnaires, in which 158-MF was the representative of 2019 production level and 158-BF, 166-BF and 210-BF were the representative of 2020 production level. The Installa - tion stage includes module transportation and installation. Considering modules were produced in Jiangsu Province and installed in Beijing (116 ◦ 25 ′ E, 39 ◦ 54 ′ N, solar irradiance 1573 kWhm �2 year �1  on the slope, calculated from Meteonorm 8.0.3, optimized angle of incidence 35 ◦ ), the transportation distance was about 2000 km. Assume all mod - ules were transported by lorry (truck>32 t, EURO 4), and the container filling rate was 70% (840 pieces/40-foot cabinet) [7]. The comprehen - sive power consumption of module installation was approximated as 10 kWh per kWp [16]. The Use stage includes module maintenance and module repair, in which comprehensive power consumption was approximated as 0.2 kWh per kWp [16], and the cleaning water con - sumption was approximated as 20 L/m 2  [11]. The End-of-Life stage includes disassembly, waste transportation and waste treatment. As - sume the comprehensive power consumption of disassembly was 0.1 kWh per kWp, the length of waste transportation was 1500 km (assuming modules were landfilled and recycled in Shanxi Province). The waste treatment was chosen as landfill, while in Section 5, Recycling was considered and comparted with landfill. The functional unit (FU) was defined as 1 kWh (kilowatt hour) of AC (alternating current) electricity generated by a photovoltaic module over its lifetime. According to the module manufacturer’s warranty, assuming the life expectancy of 25 years for mono-facial solar modules (single-glass) and 30 years for bifacial solar modules (dual-glass). Although in PERC solar module would occur light-induced degradation (LID) [17] or Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID) [18], linear degradation simplifications was still used, assuming 0.5% absolute degradation per year over a lifetime from initial effi - ciencies as shown in Table 1. Also, performance ratio (PR) was set as 0.8 for all cases in this study [19]. For bifacial modules, “Bifacial Standard Test Conditions” (BSTC), in which the bifacial modules are rated at 1000 W/m 2  irradiance at the front side and 135 W/m 2  at the rear side (both AM1.5 G) was assumed [20]. It means about 10% gain on the rear side. Different rear side gain will be discussed in Section 4. It is impor - tant to emphasize that changes in these assumptions would change the final environmental impacts results. The SimaPro 9.0 software [21] was used to calculate the environ - mental impacts of PERC solar module. Ecoinvent 3.5 [22] was used as background database. The impact categories were chosen according to the recommenda - tions of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre [23]. For  X. Jia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        GWP, the method “IPCC 2013 GWP 100a V1.03”, which is known as climate change and was developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [24], was used. Since photovoltaic electricity generation has always been considered as a clean and sustainable energy source, this indicator is very common for LCA studies [14,25]. For HTP-CE, HTP-nCE, and FEcP, the method USEtox 2 (recommended only) V1.00 was used [26]. These impacts were chosen because there are heavy metals in product, which has effects on human health and freshwater cleanliness [27]. For FEuP, the method of ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) V1.03 was used. This indicator was chosen because ni - trogen and phosphorus compounds were used in the module and cell manufacturing process. For ADP, the method of CML-IA baseline V3.05 was used. This indicator was chosen because using non-renewable ma - terials and energy in the production of PERC solar cell and module is related to the decreasing global availability of these natural resources. 3.Results and discussion The impacts of PERC mono-facial and bi-facial solar modules, considering 158.75 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm silicon wafers, were analyzed through the LCA methodology described above. The environ - mental impact contributions that accounted for more than 1% will be shown in Figs. 2–8. 3.1.Global warming potential Global Warming Potential (GWP) is related to emissions of green - house gases to air, which will influence changes in the global average  Table 1 Basic information of PERC solar modules.    158-MF (60) 158-MF (72) 158-BF (60) 158-BF (72) 166-BF (72) 210-BF (50) Rated Power (STC) 340 405 345 410 450 500 Cell Efficiency (%) 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 Wafer Size (mm) 158.75 158.75 158.75 158.75 166 210 Cell Number 60 72 60 72 72 50 Bifaciality – – 75% 75% 75% 75% CTM 1 1 1.01 1.01 1.01 1.01 Module Size (mm) 1689*996 2015*996 1708*1000 2034*1000 2128*1000 2240*1102 Module area (m 2 ) 1.68 2.01 1.71 2.03 2.13 2.47 Module Efficiency (%) 20.24 20.15 20.18 20.20 21.13 20.24 Weight (kg) 20.7 22.5 23 26.8 29 32 Lifetime Expectation (y) 25 25 30 30 30 30  a: STC: irradiance 1000/m 2 , module temperature 25  ◦ C, AM =1.5G. b: CTM: Cell to Module.

There isn’t very much difference (1.7%) between the impacts of 60 solar cells package and 72 solar cells package (lower). However, the difference between the mono-facial module and the bi-facial module can be up to 23%. This is mainly due to the fact that the bifacial module can yield 23% more energy than the mono-facial module over the whole lifetime. Not only because the warranty period of dual-glass encapsu - lation module (30 years) is 5 years longer than the single-glass encap - sulation one (25 years) [7], but also there was about 10% rear side electricity generation gain on bi-facial modules. In addition, larger wafer sizes modules show lower GWP results, the GWP being 19.88, 19.32, and 18.43 g CO 2  eq/kWh for 158-BF (72), 166-BF (72) and 210-BF (50) respectively. The GWP of 210-BF (50) is about 92.7% of 158-BF (72). The biggest contribution for the GWP came from the manufacture and supply chain of silicon wafers, accounting for about 47%–51%. The larger the wafer size, the higher the ratio of silicon wafer manufacturing and supply chain links in the total GWP. Many studies have shown that silicon wafers account for nearly half or more of the GWP [8]. The second most significant impacts arise from the manufacture of aluminum frame (Al alloys). For single-glass modules (MF), it accounts for about 12%, and the proportion of 72-piece module is lower than that of 60-piece module. For dual glass modules (BF), the use of aluminum frame is to make the module mechanical performance better, accounting for about 8%. Electricity for the production of solar cells and modules accounts for about 11–13%. This is because the electricity in China is mainly generated by coal-fired power plants, which emit large amounts of greenhouse gases in the electricity generation process [29]. It is worth noting that it only accounts for 9% in 210-BF. This is because 210-BF’s production electricity is similar to 158-BF and 166-BF, but 210-BF modules can greatly increase the electricity generation throughout the life cycle. 3.2.Human toxicity potential cancer effects Human Toxicity Potential (HTP) concerns effects of toxic substances on the human environment, normally caused by the intake of toxic substances through inhalation of air, food/water ingestion and pene - tration through the skin insofar [30]. HTP-CE accounts for those toxic substances that related to cancer. The HTP-CE result is show in Fig. 3. The most significant impacts arise from the manufacture of aluminum frame (aluminum alloys), which was caused by the disposal of red mud from bauxite digestion in the supply chain of primary aluminum [31]. The proportion was approximately 45% of mono-facial module and 34% for bi-facial module. This difference mainly comes from the design of the aluminum frame for mono-facial and bi-facial module: For same size of module, bi-facial one only uses 70% aluminum alloys of the mono-facial one. For some dual-glass modules, it is even possible not to use the aluminum frame, but only use silica gel for the encapsulation of the glass edge (not in this model). The second biggest contributor is the manufacturing of silicon wafers. As mentioned above, this is mainly due to the electricity consumption of coal fired power. It seems there is little difference of contribution of glass between MF and BF module, although the MF module has only one piece of glass while the BF module has two pieces of glasses. On one hand, the higher electricity generation of BF module flattened the influence of the glass on each 1 kWh AC electricity, on the other hand, the glass thickness of BF module was smaller than the MF module, which was 2 mm and 3.2 mm, respectively, which means the glass weight of BF was only 1.25 times of MF module. 3.3.Human toxicity potential non-cancer effects HTP-nCE accounts for those toxic substances that related to non- cancer effects and also are not caused by particulate matter/respira - tory inorganics or ionizing radiation [30]. The HTP-nCE result is show in Fig. 4. The most significant impacts arise from the transportation. In the model, the transportation mainly contains three parts: raw materials of solar cell and module materials were transported from production fac - tory to module manufacturing site; the PV modules were transported from manufacturing site to installation site in the Installation Stage; and spent modules were transported from installation site to dispose site for landfill or recycling. The transport impacts are mostly due to diesel emissions of truck, as well as related to diesel production [32]. 3.4.Freshwater ecotoxicity potential Freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEcP) addresses a variety of different toxic impacts caused by the release of substances with a direct effect on the health of freshwater, which damage individual species and  Fig. 2.Global warming potential results (g CO 2  eq/kWh).

Jia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        change the structure and function of freshwater [30]. The FEcP result is show in Fig. 5. The size of silicon wafer has little effect on this indicator. However, the difference between MF and BF module can be as high as 33%, mainly reflecting in the manufacture of silicon wafers and aluminum frame. The biggest contribution for the FEcP came from the manufacture of silicon wafers, accounting for about 60%–70%. The larger the wafer size, the higher the ratio of silicon wafer manufacturing and supply chain links in the total FEcP. Its environmental impact mainly comes from the supply chain of monocrystalline silicon ingot. The environmental impact of aluminum frame mainly comes from the disposal of red mud from bauxite digestion in the supply chain of primary aluminum [31] as discussed above. 3.5.Freshwater eutrophication potential Freshwater eutrophication potential (FEuP) accounts for the envi - ronmental persistence (fate) of the emission of phosphorus (P) and ni - trogen (N) containing nutrients. Nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) from sewage outfalls and fertilized farmland accelerate the growth of algae and other vegetation in water. The degradation of organic material consumes oxygen resulting in oxygen deficiency and, in some cases, fish death [33]. The FEuP result is shown in Fig. 6. The biggest contribution for the FEuP came from the manufacture of silicon wafers, accounting for about 47%–57%. It mainly comes from the use of nitric acid and the emission of nitrogen oxides in the production process. Other impact contribution mainly comes from the supply chain of metal related materials, such as ribbon (whose main component is copper), aluminum frame and metallization paste (in which silver ac - counts for 90%–92%). This is mainly due to the use of various acids in pyrometallurgy or hydrometallurgy in metal smelting [34], which not only has a large impact on FEuP, but also accounts a lot in the acidifi - cation potential (not shown in this paper). The usage amount of ribbon (copper) for different size modules was quite similar while for MF or BF module were quite different. Consid - ering the design structure of MF and BF module has almost no effect on the weight amount of ribbon, it is believed that this difference comes from technology optimization, because data of MF was taken from China’s actual production line of 2019, and data of BF is taken from China’s actual production line of 2020.

It concerns with protection of human welfare, human health and ecosystem health. The ADP result is show in Fig. 7. The advantage of bifacial module design reflected most strongly in this indicator, with the difference between MF and BF as high as 47%. Upgrade from mono-facial PERC solar cell to bifacial, not only the usage amount of back aluminum metallization paste (this is mainly due to the changes in cell structure), but also the amount of silver metallization paste (including front and back silver metallization paste) was greatly reduced, which was mainly due to the technology optimization as mentioned above. The most significant impact of ADP arises from the silver metallization paste. Although the amount of silver in solar cells was not very large, only about 100 mg/piece, because silver is a precious metal, its impact on resources cannot be ignored. The recovery of silver is also one of the main driving forces for the research and development of silicon module recovery technology. At the same time, reducing the amount of silver paste and finding alternative materials is also one of the research topics of photovoltaic practitioners. 3.7.Energy return on investment (EROI) It is common to consider Net Energy Analysis (NEA) of PV modules as they are the main component of electricity generation system. A prin - cipal indicator of NEA is the Energy Return On Investment, which is recommended by experts from IEA PVPS Task 12 [37]. EROI is the ratio of the amount of energy returned to society in the form of a useful energy carrier by a chain of processes exploiting a primary energy source to the total energy ‘invested’ in finding, extracting, processing, and delivering that energy [38]. The EROI is defined as:  EROI =Out / Inv                                                                            (1) In order to evaluate the economical use of photovoltaic modules, EROI in unit of electricity, EROI el , was used.  EROI el  =Out el  / Inv el  [kWh/kWh]                                                     (2) In which, Out el  is the total electricity produced over system’s  Fig. 5.Freshwater ecotoxicity potential results (PAF.m3. day/kWh).

Jia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        lifetime, while Inv el  is the energy investment in stages of Production, Installation, Use and End-of-life, in terms of its electricity demand. In terms of Out el  during service life (SL), the total electricity gener - ation of 1 kWp PV module can be calculated with the equation: ·×∗ ÷⋄ =± 1 ×(1+∑ ∓⊕�1⊖=1 (1�⊗÷⊘) ⊖ )(3)  ± 1⊙© = ◦••[ ≍≡⊆⊇ 2 ‘≤÷≥• ]1000[ ≡⊇ 2 ]×1[≍≡≼]×1[≤÷≥•]×≽∼(4)  ± 1≈© = ◦••[ ≍≡⊆⊇ 2 ‘≤÷≥• ]×(1+0�135×≈⊂⊃≥≪⊂≥⋄⊂∗≫)1000[ ≡⊇ 2 ]×1[≍≡≼]×1[≤÷≥•]×≽∼(5)  Where E 1  is the electricity generation of 1 kWp PV module in the first year, SL is the service life (25 years or 30 years), deg is the linear degradation rate 0.5%. Irr is the solar irradiance on the slope, which is 1573 kWhm �2 year �1  for Beijing with angle of incidence being 35 ◦ (calculated from Meteonorm 8.0.3). For bifacial modules, “Bifacial Standard Test Conditions” (BSTC), in which the bifacial modules are rated at 1000 W/m 2  irradiance at the front side and 135 W/m 2  at the rear side (both AM1.5G) was assumed [20]. The EROI result is shown in Fig. 8. In this calculation, it is assumed that modules were installed in Beijing, which is not an area rich in solar resources. If the installation location was in areas rich in solar resources, such as Tibet or the Middle East, the EROI value will be further increased. To further increase EROI of photovoltaic modules, on the one hand, further increase the total yield of PV modules throughout the life cycle, including increasing solar cell efficiency and extending module life; on the other hand, further reduce energy consumption in the supply chain of modules and their raw materials. 4.Effects of different ground conditions for bifacial PERC modules Taking 166-BF (72) as an example, the effect of different installation grounds beneath bifacial PERC modules on the change of the overall environmental impact was analyzed. In the same site, different instal - lation conditions, i. e different ground materials, result in different amounts of radiation reflected to the rear side of the module due to the different reflectivity of the ground material, resulting in differences in the rear side power gain. LCA of them was done by adding additional life  Fig. 7.Abiotic depletion potential results (kg Sb eq/kWh).

Jia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        cycle of ground materials into the system boundary. The area of the 166-BF (72) module was 2.03 m 2 . Assuming modules were installed in Beijing, the ground projection area was 1.58 m 2 . The usage amount of ground materials was calculated by the area, based on reasonable substitution. The rear gain rate came from demonstration bases of LONGi [7], shown in Table 3. The result is shown in Fig. 9. The functional unit was 1 kWh AC, so all environmental impact indicators will be compared with ‘1/electricity generation’. Because different ground materials with different reflective index obtain different rear side gains, the total electricity generation of the module during the entire life cycle will change with various ground conditions. The higher the rear side gain, the greater the total energy yield during the life cycle, and the smaller the value of 1/electricity generation. If the environmental indicator is lower than 1/electricity generation, it indicates that the environmental performance in this ground condition is positive. The greater the difference between the percentage of environmental indicators lower than the 1/electricity generation, the better the environmental performance in this case. The lowest impact is for Desert, because desert is a natural condition, there is no additional cycle in system boundary. And because the desert has an excellent rear side gain of up to 25%, the environmental per - formance it produces was optimal in all situations. TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) is polymer roof waterproof material, with advantages of long lifetime, thin thickness and low dosage. It provides rear side gain as high as 25%, and its environmental performance is equivalent to 1#, making it as an excellent choice for ground reflection materials. It cannot be rejected simply because it is a polymer material. In addition, the environmental performance of white gravel, sand, and grassland was also positive. Besides, they showed great results in HTP-nCE. Therefore, they can be selected in some landscape design needs. However, concrete and light asphalt was not recommended as ground reflection materials. 5.Effects of recycling in end-of-life stage Two disposal methods in End-of-life stage, municipal landfill and recycling, were compared. Municipal landfill was evaluated by IEA PVPS Task 12 [10] and current PEFCR in LCA modeling of PV module [11]. Because with an expected lifetime of 25–30 years and installation of PV modules in significant amounts only starting a decade ago, there have been no significant volumes of waste modules. Hence practical, verifiable experience on industrial scale recycling processes is missing for the majority of the technologies. However, the author joined Na - tional Key R&D Program of China called Complete Sets of Technology and Equipment for Recycling of Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Modules [13], and collected data from silicon module recycling pilot line. The silicon material in spent modules was recovered as metallurgical grade silicon, with rate of 90%. All aluminum frame (100%) was dis - assembled as post-consumer aluminum scrap. Although 90% of solar glass (tempered) can be recycled intact, it still needs to be refurbished before put on the market again. Therefore, glass was recovered as glass cullet, with rate of 95%. Metal, such as cooper in ribbon and silver in metallization grid line, was recovered as element, with rate of 90%. The power consumption of entire recycling pilot line was estimated to be 25 kWh/kWp(recycled), approximate 380 kWh/ton of waste modules. Waste PET, PVF, EVA, POE and other polymer components were assumed to enter the corresponding waste market or treatment channel. Other remaining parts were treated in municipal landfill. The result is shown in Fig. 10. Recycling can reduce all environ - mental impact indicators to a certain extent, which mainly comes from the environmental benefits obtained in the recycling process: that is, recovered materials can avoid environmental burdens caused by the primary production of replaced products. Among 7 indicators, ADP, HTP-CE and FEuP are the three indicators with the most significant decline. Taking 158-BF (60) as an example, in ADP, the processes with environmental benefits are the recovery of silver (76.06%), aluminum (16.87%), cooper (7.00%), metallurgical grade silicon (0.06%) and glass cullet (0.01%); in HTP-CE, the processes with environmental benefits are the recovery of aluminum (82.87%), silver (7.91%), metallurgical grade silicon (6.08%), cooper (2.83%), and glass cullet (0.31%); in FEuP, the processes with environmental benefits are the recovery of copper (59.52%), silver (19.38%), aluminum (15.07%), metallurgical grade silicon (6.01%) and glass cullet (0.03%). It can be seen that although the amount of silver and copper used in modules is very small, reaching 0.02% and 0.76% of module weight, respectively. The recycling of them has a significant effect on reducing the total environmental impact of PV modules. On the contrary, although the mass proportion of glass in modules is as high as 65% (MF) ~75% (BF), as well as current recycling technology routes are mainly aimed at recycling of glass, it can only achieve small gain in environ - mental benefit. Nevertheless, for countries where landfill is less easily available, the avoidance of landfill volume consumption may improve the environmental performance of glass recovery. In addition, although the recycling process has additional energy requirements, the power demand is very small relative to the electricity generation of modules throughout the life cycle. Adding recycling will not significantly reduce their EROI. 6.Comparison of transparent back-sheet and dual-glass encapsulation According to ITRPV roadmap [4], the market share of bifacial modules was 15% in 2019 and will expand to 60% in 2029. Since traditional back-sheet is opaque, in order to meet the encapsulation  Table 3 The rear side gain and usage amount of ground materials of different ground conditions [7].

Assuming same service life, 30 years.   X. Jia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        requirements of bifacial modules, dual-glass packaging is often used. According to a survey by Taiyangnews [39], the market share of dual glass modules reached 11% in 2019 and will rise to 18% in 2020. This greatly squeezes the market space of the plastic back-sheet. Therefore, the industry has developed a transparent back-sheet, and its market share in 2019 was about 1.4%. The traditional back-sheet is a composite type back-sheet. The structure of PVF(polyvinyl fluoride)/PET (polyethylene terephthalate)/ PVF is most commonly used, with adhesive between PVF and PET for bonding. In order to further reduce costs, a coated type back-sheet was developed, mainly with FEVE (Fluoro-olefin Vinyl Ether Copolymer) as the main coating, which will be chemically bonded to the PET base film. The most common structure of transparent back-sheet is PVF/PET/ FEVE. Fig. 11 shows the environmental impacts of 158-BF (60) modules encapsulated with dual glass and transparent back-sheet, assuming landfill in End-of-life as well as both 30 years of service life. It can be seen that the environmental impacts of transparent back-sheet packaged modules were slightly higher than that of dual-glass modules, but the difference is quite small. In this model, the thickness of the front cover glass matched with transparent back-sheet was 3.2 mm, and the glass thickness of the dual-glass module was 2 mm. If the thickness of the glass matched with the transparent back-sheet can be further reduced, the environmental impacts of two can be basically the same. 7.Suggestions for environmental optimization There is still room for reduction in the environmental impact of PERC modules. First, increase the total electricity generation of PERC module during the life cycle can decrease the environmental impact of 1 kWh net of electricity that generated. The PERC cell efficiency in the LCA modeling was the average efficiency of the current Chinese photovoltaic manu - facturer’s production line, which was about 22.5%. However, in January 2019, LONGi Group reported that the latest world record efficiency of PERC solar cell was 24.06% [40]. That means, even no changes in other stages of life cycle, the environmental impact will decrease by 7% as soon as this record solar cell transferred to routine production. More - over, increased module efficiency can reduce the expenditure of photovoltaic electricity generation systems in the BOS, such as cables and concretes, which has good consequences for the overall system impacts as well as LCOE. However, it should also be noted that there has been no new record of PERC cell efficiency since then, which also im - plies that the efficiency of PERC may has reached the limit. Second, the energy and material consumption in production stage can still be further reduced. Judging from the results of GWP, FEcP, FEuP and EROI, silicon wafer production accounts for a large proportion of the environmental impact of PERC modules. At present, the devel - opment of silicon wafers is not only towards larger-size, but also towards thinner thickness due to the popularization of diamond wire cutting. At present, silicon wafers with a thickness of 140   m have been applied to Heterojunction Intrinsic Thin-layer (HIT) solar modules. If thinner sili - con wafers can be used widely, the environmental impact will be reduced by 11% compared to the current 180   m silicon wafers. In addition, by comparing the Bill of Material (BOM) of 2018 and 2019, the consumption of other chemicals was also decreasing with processing improvements. Third, the recycling process will officially join the photovoltaic in - dustry chain eventually, and the continuous optimization of recycling technology will further promote circular economy. The recovery of various components in modules can undoubtedly reduce the mining of corresponding materials and energy consumption. Advancing recycling technology will also further increase the value of recycled components. For example, in the model of Section 5, the recycled silicon material was treated as metallurgical-grade silicon. This is because the silicon wafer as the bulk of solar cell was heavily doped by n-type emitter on the front surface and by aluminum on the rear side. These doped layers reduce the overall purity of silicon material. At present, there have been researches specifically aimed at the removal of doped layers of silicon materials [41,42]. If the development will be successful applied on recycling process, the recycled silicon material can be directly used as solar-grade silicon to enter the ingot casting or pulling, and further enhancing the environmental benefit brought by recycling of silicon. Fourth, the energy transition is accelerating in various countries, and a further reduction in the proportion of fossil energy in the national grid will contribute to the environmental impact of the entire photovoltaic supply chain. Taking China as an example, President Xi Jinping prom - ised on behalf of China at the General Debate of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, that “China is willing to contribute more to the fight against climate change, as it aims to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 with more forceful policies and measures” [43]. Among its specific goals, a very important one is: “By 2030, the proportion of non-fossil energy in primary energy consumption will reach about 25%, and the total installed capacity of wind and solar power It will reach 1.2 billion kilowatts or more.” [44] In 2020, the proportion of renewable energy in China’s power grid has reached 15.3% [45], and there is still a lot of room for the CO 2  equiv - alent/kWh of the power grid to drop. Chinese photovoltaic companies are also actively responding to the country’s call. Leading manufacturers such as LONGi has joined up the RE100 membership and promised to achieve 100% use of renewable energy in global operations by 2028 [46], TONGWEI Group has announced the plans to achieve the carbon neutral target by 2023 [47]. This will be even more beneficial for reducing the overall environmental impact of photovoltaic modules produced in China. 8.Conclusions Through the LCA methodology, GWP, HTP-CE, HTP-nCE, FEcP, FEuP, ADP and EROI of mono-facial and bifacial mono-crystalline sili - con PERC modules (considering 155.85 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm wafer size and 60, 72 or 50 solar cell package) were analyzed. The comparison between different module types was carried out by taking 1 kWh of AC electricity generated by a photovoltaic module over its lifetime as the functional unit. The environmental impact of bifacial modules was significantly lower than that of mono-facial modules. This was mainly due to the fact that the electricity generation of BF modules exceeds that of MF modules by about 23% during the entire life cycle, while the material and energy consumption at all stages were basically the same. The number of solar cells encapsulated in one module has little effect on the environment impact. By expanding the size of silicon wafers, the environmental impact of the corresponding modules will also be reduced. Among many influencing factors, the manufacturing of silicon wafers was the most important, accounting for half or more in many indicators, such as GWP, FEcP and FEuP. The larger the silicon wafer size, the higher the ratio, meaning more obvious the environmental impact caused by the manufacturing and use of silicon wafers. Therefore, in addition to the development trend of larger-size, the trend of thinner- wafer was also important. In addition, the use of metals, such as sil - ver, copper, and aluminum in modules also has a great contribution in the overall environment impact of PERC modules, even though their mass fraction is only 1%, especially in indicators such as ADP and FEuP. The overall environmental impact of PERC module still has room for further decline. For bifacial modules, how to choose the installation ground condi - tions to ensure high gain on the rear side without significantly increasing the environmental impact, is one of the issues that the system designer should consider. After comparing 10 ground conditions, it is found that the roof waterproof membrane TPO material is one of the good choices, if there is no desert. In some landscape design needs, white gravel, sand or grassland can also be used. Concrete and light asphalt are not  X.

In the end-of-life stage, two options were compared, namely municipal landfill and recycling. Recycling can effectively reduce the overall environmental impact of PERC modules, especially in indicators of ADP, HTP-CE and FEuP. The environmental impact of the transparent back-sheet encapsulation and the dual-glass encapsulation of PERC modules was similar.

Currently, PV industry is looking towards different technologically feasible options of transferring this cell concept from laboratory research towards industrial manufacturing. In this paper, we devise cost-driven stra - tegies towards industrial manufacturing of TOPCon-based solar cells after assessing various process routes based on currently production-ready and upcoming future alternative process technologies. Our techno-economic assessment suggests that higher capital and operational costs required for TOPCon concept is distributed un - evenly in the process value chain, with a significant fraction in diffusion/annealing and metallization steps. Nevertheless, under given assumptions, TOPCon-concepts are found to remain economically competitive against bifacial PERC in terms of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), if a minimum absolute gain in cell efficiency    >0.55% for most-conservative and    >0.40% for most-progressive scenarios respectively can be maintained.    1.Introduction Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells [1] are widely seen as the forthcoming technology to the current state-of-the-art passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC)-concept. The cell architecture is based on the concept of ‘passivating and carrier selective contacts’, where the recombination of minority charge carriers is suppressed by a stack of thin tunnel oxide and heavily-doped polysilicon (poly-Si) layers. The efficiency potential of this concept is already proven in laboratory scale solar cells by reaching open circuit voltages (V OC ) of up to 725 mV and conversion efficiencies over 26% [2,3]. Moreover, initial industrial adoption of this technology by PV manufacturers also shows promising results [4–7]. The envisioned industrial TOPCon process routes consist of the process steps that are either fully/partly transferable from the state-of- the-art PERC cell, with inclusion of few extra process steps that are necessary to increase the conversion efficiency. The technological maturity and the proven industrial readiness of process technologies used in PERC is widely believed to provide an easy transition of PV in - dustry towards the higher efficiency cell concepts such as TOPCon. Another potential advantage of carrying this evolutionary approach is the possibility of upgrading the existing PERC production lines for TOPCon processing with addition of minimum number of process steps, provided that the required area is available in the PERC facility. Formation of tunnel oxide and deposition of intrinsic/doped poly-Si are the two crucial processing steps that are additional to the current PERC processing, and mainly define the process routes for TOPCon processing. The properties of these layers are vital towards designing the subsequent cell processing steps, aiming to achieve high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and a low series resistance promised by the TOPCon- concept. Apart from these steps, industrial TOPCon cells are mainly based on more expensive n-type substrates, and require integration of the boron emitter diffusion process with less industrial maturity in comparison to the phosphorous diffusion process typically used in p- PERC cells. Low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) of a-Si layers after an in-situ grown thermal tunnel oxide is the current production- ready technology for industrial processing of TOPCon cells. Mean - while, the TOPCon process routes that are based on alternative a-Si deposition technologies are currently being investigated in research facilities, and are expected to be ready for mainstream production in the near future. In fact, various process routes and a wide range of tech - nology options for the TOPCon concept are currently in consideration by the PV industry both in terms of their technological and economic viability. However, for the mass production of each of these TOPCon- concepts, the economic competitiveness against the current  *Corresponding author. E-mail address: bishal.kafle@ise.fraunhofer.de (B.

Current PERC-concept is reported to reach up to 23% average conversion efficiencies in mass production with a fairly mature process sequence [8]. These continuous improvements in the price-performance ratio up-to-now enable PERC to be the preferred option for utility-scale installations. Therefore, the additional capital and operating costs required to establish and operate a TOPCon manufacturing facility needs to be offset by an increment in conversion efficiency in the cell/module/system level, in order to further lower the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in large scale PV installations. An in-depth look at the cost-effective manufacturing op - tions for TOPCon is highly relevant for the PV industry, which is currently looking at different options of transferring the TOPCon concept from laboratory research to production lines as the potential next evolutionary solar cell technology upgrade to PERC. In this work, we aim to devise cost-driven strategies towards mass manufacturing of TOPCon-based solar cells using bottom-up total cost of ownership (TCO) calculations of individual process steps in the PV value chain and the associated cell processing routes. Based on the available literature, feedback from industry, and technological developments at Fraunhofer ISE, we first discuss the up-to-now industrialized LPCVD based process routes for the TOPCon concept. We then outline and discuss status of various alternative technologies. Based on the results of the production readiness, we perform cost of ownership (COO) calcu - lations of different amorphous silicon (a-Si) deposition technologies, with the intent of identifying and outlining technologically feasible process routes for the industrial TOPCon solar cell architecture, and analyze their competitiveness to the mainstream bifacial PERC cell in terms of cell/module/system costs, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for a utility-scale green field installation. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed for the selected TOPCon routes in order to identify the minimum required increment in conversion efficiency to PERC in order to reach economic competitiveness. Based on our findings, current and future technology options for the mass production of TOPCon solar cells will be discussed. 2.Approach We focus on TOPCon architecture featuring screen-printed contacts on both-sides of n-type Si substrate as they promise the highest potential gain in conversion efficiency over the bifacial p-PERC-concept, with the best prospects for mass production. The investigated cell architecture is shown in Fig. 1. The TOPCon solar cell is based on an n-type c-Si substrate with boron (p + ) emitter on the textured (front) side. The front side is passivated by a dielectric stack of passivation and anti-reflection layer. The rear side with either textured/semi-polished or polished surface features tunnel oxide and doped polysilicon layer acting as passivating carrier-selective contact, stacked with amorphous hydrogenated silicon nitride (a-SiN x ) layer as the source of hydrogenation to passivate the dangling bonds in Si–SiO 2  interface [9,10]. Metallization is performed by screen-printing of Ag or Ag–Al grid on front and Ag-grid on rear considering bifacial application. The reference PERC cell is a p-type bifacial solar cell, featuring phosphorus (n ++ )-emitter, front and rear passivation layers and both-sided screen-printed contacts. Detailed process routes for the investigated cell types are outlined in respective sections of the paper. The bottom up total cost of ownership (TCO) calculations are per - formed along the PV value chain by using the internally developed ‘SCost’ model at Fraunhofer ISE [11,12]. The model calculates the cost of ownership (COO) for individual manufacturing process steps at each stage of the PV value chain in accordance with the SEMI standards E35 [13] and E10 [14], and builds a process route considering equipment interdependencies, production overhead costs and cost of capital at the factory level to estimate the TCO for the desired solar cell architecture. Different industrially feasible a-Si deposition technologies are identified and compared based upon equipment and process parameters, which are based on data provided by industrial equipment manufacturers as well as our own process parameters for industrial equipments within Fraunhofer ISE’s PV-TEC pilot line. For each deposition technology, process routes that show the most promise towards mass production are identified based upon the technological and economic feasibility of the entailed process steps. The following are the primary selection criteria set for the best manufacturing scenario: a) availability of an industrial tool, b) process compatibility, c) availability of all process parameters required for the COO modeling, d) lean process flow, and e) successful demonstration of the process functionality. A LCOE sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the minimum gain in conversion efficiency needed for TOPCon concepts in order to remain competitive against the bifacial p-PERC benchmark at LCOE level. 3.LPCVD based TOPCon routes To date, industrial screen-printed TOPCon solar cells on n-type substrates are based on LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si deposition technology. Typically, silicon layers that are predominantly amorphous in nature are first deposited and then subjected to a high temperature annealing step in order to form polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) layer with mixed frac - tions of amorphous and crystalline phases. 3.1.LPCVD for a-Si deposition LPCVD is used as one of the important processes established in the semiconductor facilities to deposit highly conformal layers of a-Si/poly- Si layers at low-pressure conditions [15]. The main advantages of this technology are: a) good thickness distribution along the wafer and the boat, b) pin-hole free layers with good step coverage, c) maintaining the impurity profile previously formed in the wafer due to the use of rela - tively low deposition temperatures close to 600  ◦ C, d) large number of wafers per batch, and e) option of in-situ doping with constant doping profile [16]. For the TOPCon concept investigated in this work, a phosphorus- doped a-Si/poly-Si layer (a-Si(n)/poly-Si(n)) is required to be depos - ited on the rear side of the solar cell. Here, silane (SiH 4 ) is used as a precursor for silicon deposition, optionally using diluted PH 3  (in N 2 ) to incorporate dopants in the layer. The layer properties are influenced by the deposition pressure, the silane concentration, the dopant content, and most significantly by the deposition temperature. For the identical process conditions, inclusion of doping gas significantly influences the film growth, i.e. the silicon deposition rate. For instance, depending upon the process conditions, inclusion of PH 3  flux is reported to lower the deposition rate by several times [17] that is further exacerbated by an increase in PH 3  flux [16]. This leads to two approaches of LPCVD a-Si deposition – a) deposition of intrinsic a-Si/poly-Si layers, followed by an ex-situ POCl 3  tube diffusion process to form poly-Si(n) layers, b) depo - sition of in-situ doped a-Si(n)/poly-Si(n) layers and subsequent thermal  Fig. 1.Schematic showing the TOPCon cell architecture investigated in the present work.  B. Kafle et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     annealing in N 2 . In Fig. 2, we calculate the COO of intrinsic and phosphorus-doped layers for the same thickness of 150 nm, considering about 36% lower deposition rate for in-situ doped grown layers in comparison to intrinsic layers. LPCVD depositions are performed here in a front-front configuration, i.e. placing two wafers facing front sides in a single slot. It can be observed that the COO of LPCVD step increases by almost 15% abs.  if in-situ phosphorus- doped layers are deposited instead of intrinsic a-Si layers. Here, one of the major cost driving factors is the reduced throughput of the LPCVD tool due to a significantly longer process duration, which directly increases all the fixed costs. A small cost contribution of additional PH 3  flux for phosphorus doped layer is found to be less significant as the corresponding SiH 4  flux is about 20 times higher and is mainly responsible for the process consumables costs. 3.2.Industrially viable LPCVD TOPCon routes Fig. 3 schematically shows the TOPCon process routes based upon LPCVD a-Si technology, and the reference process route for bifacial p- PERC. For p-type PERC cell (Bifacial p-PERC), alkaline textured wafers receive a phosphorus emitter by a POCl 3 -based low pressure tube diffusion furnace. Afterwards, highly phosphorous-doped regions are selectively formed on the front side by using a laser source, aiming to drive phosphorous atoms from the phosphorsilicate glass (PSG) layer into the silicon substrate. Such a selective-emitter approach is intended mainly to lower the recombination of minority charge carriers beneath the metal contacts. This is followed by the rear-emitter removal or chemical edge isolation (CEI) process, PSG etching and ozone-based cleaning [18] in the same wet-chemical inline tool. Ozone cleaning oxidizes the silicon surface, the oxide then being removed with a final HF-dip before the surface passivation steps. Advanced passivation of front and rear side is envisioned by growing thin thermal silicon oxide of about 2 nm before passivation of rear (PECVD AlO x /a-SiN x  stack) and front (PECVD a-SiN x ), which is deemed here a necessary step to reach a high average conversion efficiency of 23.0% in bifacial p-PERC pro - duction. After passivation process, screen-printing of rear is performed by first printing Ag contact pads before printing Al grid, followed by the printing of Ag grid on the front. After fast-firing (FFO), a regeneration process is required to compensate the losses in conversion efficiency due to light induced degradation (LID), which is related to the formation of boron-oxygen complexes [19]. The two TOPCon routes differ mainly by the method used to form doped a-Si/poly-Si layers. After the texturing process, boron doping is performed for TOPCon cells using BBr 3  precursor in a tube diffusion furnace to form boron (p + ) emitter. This is followed by an inline wet- chemical process to single-sided removal of rear-side emitter, whereas keeping the BSG layer in front-side intact; before performing ozone- based cleaning sequence. The BSG is kept intact on the front side in order to protect the boron emitter from being etched during the single- sided etching (SSE) of poly-Si. Afterwards, tunnel oxide is formed in-situ by oxidizing c-Si surface inside LPCVD furnace, which is followed by deposition of either intrinsic (LPCVD TOPCon exsitu) or phosphorus (n + -) doped a-Si/poly-Si layer (LPCVD TOPCon insitu) in a front-front process (two wafers per slot facing front sides). The a-Si/poly-Si deposition by LPCVD is inherently both-sided, therefore leading to the parasitic deposition of layers on the undesired (front) side, even if the wafers are placed in front-front configuration (two wafers placed per slot). For the LPCVD TOPCon exsitu process route, an additional POCl 3  diffusion is required to incorporate dopants into a-Si/poly-Si layer, which simulta - neously acts as a thermal annealing step required to cause phase change of predominantly amorphous layer to a polycrystalline layer, so called polycrystalline-silicon (poly-Si). The ex-situ doping of the poly-Si layer is also possible to achieve using an ion implantation process [6], how - ever, we focus on poly-Si doping using the tube furnace as it is more widely established in research and industry leading to a more accessible process parameter dataset availability. The POCl 3  diffusion process is optimized to dope the polysilicon layer with a constant doping concentration. During the ex-situ doping of poly-Si, the interfacial tunnel oxide acts like a barrier layer and helps in uniform distribution of dopants within the entire thickness of the poly-Si layer [20]. Consequently, there is a strong reduction in phosphorus doping concentration at SiO x -Si interface, although some dopants typi - cally also diffuse through the tunnel oxide into the silicon base to form a so called ’diffusion-tail’. The thermal tunnel oxide formed inside LPCVD furnace is reported to be stable enough to withstand the typical tem - peratures (850–900  ◦ C) used in the POCl 3  diffusion process [21]. The doping level of poly-Si layer is not only crucial for carrier selectivity, but also to maintain a high lateral conductivity in poly-Si layer, which fa - cilitates easier current transport to metal contacts. However, an excess doping into c-Si substrate should be avoided to limit the Auger recom - bination of charge carriers. The front-side poly-Si layer needs to be removed using a single sided etching (SSE poly) process, before pro - ceeding further with the passivation of the boron emitter. For LPCVD  Fig. 2.Cost of ownership (COO) of 150 nm LPCVD deposited intrinsic (left) and phosphorus-doped a-Si/poly-Si (right) layers. Cell conversion efficiency of 23.5% on M4 size wafers is assumed here in both cases to calculate $ct/Wp costs. Here, CYL refers to the cost of yield loss.  B. Kafle et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     TOPCon exsitu, this is assumed to be performed wet-chemically in an inline wet-etching tool after POCl 3 -diffusion, which after removing the PSG layer subsequently performs single-sided etching of polysilicon (SSE), followed by BSG removal and finally ozone-based wet-chemical cleaning step. The SSE process is assumed to be performed in a diluted alkaline solution [22], where the intact BSG layer on the textured side prevents etching of p + emitter by acting as a barrier layer. Afterwards, boron emitter passivation is performed by first growing a thin low-temperature thermal oxide of 1–2 nm in a tube furnace before deposition of PECVD AlO x /a-SiN x  layer stack on the front side. After - wards, PECVD a-SiN x :H is also deposited on top of poly-Si layer in the rear side as a hydrogenation source. For LPCVD TOPCon insitu, the deposition of phosphorus doped LPCVD layers is followed in an inline wet-chemical tool to perform SSE of a-Si layer on the front-side, with a subsequent BSG etching and ozone-based wet-chemical cleaning. Af - terwards, a high temperature annealing process is required to form poly-Si layers at the rear. Looking into reducing the COO of LPCVD TOPCon insitu process route burdened by a costlier LPCVD deposition, we assume technological feasibility of optimizing the high temperature annealing step to form a high quality thin SiO x  oxide on the boron emitter at the front side. This avoids the use of an extra thermal oxidation step, which is otherwise required to realize high quality passivation of the boron emitter before deposition of PECVD AlO x / - a-SiN x  stack. It should be mentioned that the high temperature steps performed after a-Si/poly-Si deposition (POCl 3  diffusion for LPCVD TOPCon exsitu, and annealing for LPCVD TOPCon insitu) should be carefully developed not to substantially alter the boron emitter profile on the textured-side of the solar cell. Afterwards, front and rear metal - lization is performed by using screen-printing Ag-Al and Ag grids respectively on front and rear sides, followed by the fast-firing process and I–V measurements. Before comparing the TCO results of PERC and TOPCon cells, it is intuitive to closely look at the major difference in process steps for the two investigated TOPCon process routes from cost perspective. In Fig. 4, COO of individual process steps that are not common for both TOPCon routes are plotted, together with the cumulative sum of all those steps. Here, the LPCVD TOPCon exsitu route features four process steps: LPCVD a/poly-Si(i) deposition, LP POCl 3 , inline wet-chemical process (PSG etch, SSE, BSG etch and O 3  cleaning), and low temperature thermal oxidation (SiO x  B-emitter). LPCVD TOPCon insitu features three process steps that are unique to this route in comparison to the other TOPCon route: LPCVD a-Si(n) deposition, inline wet-chemical process for SSE,  Fig. 3.Process routes for bifacial p-PERC and both side contacted n-TOPCon-concepts based upon LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si layer.   Fig. 4.COO ($ct/Wp) of individual process steps that are unique for TOPCon concepts - LPCVD TOPCon exsitu (left) and LPCVD TOPCon insitu (right). Cell conversion efficiency of 23.5% on M4 size wafers is assumed here for TOPCon concepts to calculate $ct/Wp costs. Here, CYL refers to cost of yield losses.  B. Kafle et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BSG etch and O 3  cleaning, and high temperature annealing process (Poly-Si Anneal). It is noticeable that although the COO of 150 nm LPCVD a/poly-Si(n) is almost 15% abs.  higher than 150 nm LPCVD a/ poly-Si(i), the process route for doped a/poly-Si layer can be adapted to allow almost 18% abs.  lower cumulative COO for the combined TOP - Con steps. Here, LPCVD TOPCon insitu benefits from the absence of the POCl 3  diffusion step. Additionally, under given assumption of combining both annealing and oxidation processes within a single pro - cessing step, LPCVD TOPCon insitu also features less number of process steps in comparison to LPCVD TOPCon exsitu. 3.3.Comparison of total cost of ownership (TCO) to PERC In Fig. 5, the total cost of ownership of PERC and TOPCon processes is distributed into wet-chemical, diffusion and annealing, passivation, and metallization process categories. Wet-chemical processes include alkaline texturing, CEI, glass removal (PSG/BSG), O 3  cleaning, and SSE of polysilicon layer. It is observed that there is an increase in total COO of the wet-chemical processes for TOPCon routes, mainly due to the requirement of additional glass etching, SSE(poly) and cleaning process step. Diffusion and annealing processes include POCl 3  and BBr 3  doping, selective laser-doping, and high temperature annealing step for a-Si layer. COO for TOPCon routes are here significantly higher for diffu - sion/anneal processes due to: a) a longer process duration of BBr 3  diffusion in comparison to POCl 3 -based process leading to a significantly reduced throughput, and b) requirement of either an additional POCl 3 - doping process or a high temperature annealing step for a-Si layers. Passivation processes include thermal oxidation, LPCVD polysilicon depositions, and PECVD depositions of PECVD AlO x /a-SiN x  stack, and a- SiN x :H layer. For TOPCon routes, requirement of an additional LPCVD deposition step to PERC is typically expected to increase the costs for passivation process, as seen for LPCVD TOPCon exsitu. However, for LPCVD TOPCon insitu, process costs are lowered by combining high temperature annealing with oxidation in a single process step. Metalli - zation costs include screen-printing of pads (Ag) and grids (Al and Ag/ Ag-Al), and the fast-firing process. For bifacial p-PERC cell, the laser contact opening and regeneration process steps are also included in the ‘Metallization’ category. A significantly higher metallization cost is required for TOPCon cells, mainly due to the requirement of printing Ag- based grids on both sides to form contacts with low contact resistivity. In fact, a huge share of process consumables costs in COO of a TOPCon cell is predominantly related to a high Ag consumption during metallization. Thus, in order to further lower COO of a TOPCon cell, significant reduction in Ag consumption is required. Moreover, the recent volatility in Ag prices and an increasingly growing share of industrial Ag use by the PV industry is expected to drive efforts towards lowering the Ag consumption in solar cells. Fig. 6 compares COO of the metallization step for bifacial p-PERC and TOPCon cells for various scenario of Ag reduction. The most optimistic scenario of reducing Ag consumption of the cell by 50% of its current value is  Fig. 5.Cost of ownership ($ct/Wp) comparison of bifacial p-PERC vs LPCVD TOPCon process routes with costs of individual process steps categorized under as wet- chemistry, diffusion �∆�Θannealing (Diffusion/Anneal), passivation and metallization. For bifacial p-PERC solar cell, selective laser-doping is grouped under Diffusion/ Anneal together with POCl 3  diffusion process, whereas laser contact opening (LCO) and regeneration processes are grouped under metallization category together with screen-printing and firing processes. In the legend, CYL represent cost of yield losses. Here, cell efficiencies of 23.0% and 23.5% on M4 wafer sizes are assumed for bifacial p-PERC and TOPCon cells respectively.  Fig. 6.Cost of ownership ($ct/Wp) of the metallization step projected for percentage reduction in total Ag consumption during industrial screen printing of front and rear grids (including busbar and fingers) for bifacial p-PERC and LPCVD TOPCon process routes. For p-PERC cells, it is assumed that total Ag consumption is dominated by the front-side (Ag fraction utilized for rear- tabbing kept constant), and aluminum consumption for the rear-side is kept unchanged for all scenarios. For p-PERC cells, laser contact opening (LCO) and regeneration processes are grouped under metallization category together with screen-printing and firing processes.  B. Kafle et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     based upon the estimates of International Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) [42]. Here, we assume that the Aluminum consumption for rear-side grid formation and the amount of Ag required for rear tabbing of PERC cells remain unchanged. COO of the metallization step dips dramatically for both cell types with lowering consumable costs related to Ag. Nevertheless, the slope is much higher for the TOPCon cells due to their usage of Ag on both front and rear contacts. It is interesting to note that if the metallization concepts in future allow 50% reduction in Ag usage, metallization costs of TOPCon cells are on-par with PERC cells, with former potentially even achieving lower watt-peak costs ($/Wp) due to a higher cell power. In summary, the TCO in cell level is significantly higher for TOPCon concept in comparison to p-PERC cell. Nevertheless, LPCVD TOPCon insitu route offers lower COO between the two investigated LPCVD- based TOPCon routes. 4.Alternative TOPCon process routes As mentioned earlier, deposition of a-Si layer is one of the most important process steps required to realize a TOPCon solar cell. Although LPCVD is currently the only industrialized process for a-Si deposition, there are several alternative technologies that are currently being tested and are in different stages of development. Besides, the tunnel oxide formation is also possible to realize using alternative oxidation methods, other than thermal oxidation that is used for LPCVD- based TOPCon process routes. In this section, different methods to form tunnel oxide and deposit a-Si layer are briefly summarized, as these steps are vital towards designing the subsequent cell processing steps. 4.1.Tunnel oxide formation A thin interfacial oxide layer is grown on c-Si surface before depos - iting either intrinsic or doped amorphous silicon layers. The oxide layer not only provides an excellent passivation of c-Si surface, but also allows the transport of majority charge carriers from c-Si towards the metal contacts through the doped poly-Si layer. The stoichiometry and the thickness of the oxide layer mainly determine the thermal stability of the layer, which is a crucial aspect considering the current PV manufacturing process route that features several high temperature steps [23,24]. Table 1 outlines the available processes in literature and important characteristics to consider while choosing the method. The oxides are formed either by wet-chemical or dry methods. Among wet-chemical methods, DI-O 3  oxide is shown to have very good thermal stability [23]. Among dry methods, in-situ thermal oxide followed by the LPCVD a-Si deposition is the current mainstream process to form TOPCon layers in industry [25]. An appealing candidate is O 3 -based oxidation induced by dissociation of O 2  by UV light sources [23]. This highly cost-effective method is able to form thermally stable stoichio - metric SiO x  layers [23] for high-efficiency TOPCon cells, and potentially can be easily mounted at the end of the wet-chemical cleaning tool to ensure a lean process flow. Plasma-based oxidation is also a promising approach to form in-situ and thermally stable SiO x  layer using a PECVD tool [26–28], which can also be simultaneously used to deposit a-Si layers. In summary, although most of the above discussed oxidation methods are principally applicable in PV manufacturing, their choice largely depends upon the used a-Si/poly-Si deposition technology. 4.2.Deposition of a-Si layer Typically, a-Si layers are first deposited and then subjected to a high temperature annealing step in order to form poly-Si layer. Depending upon the deposition technology, the doping of poly-Si is performed either during the deposition process (in-situ) or by a follow up diffusion process (ex-situ). Importantly, the choice of a-Si deposition technology dictates almost all the other important cell processing steps. Table 2 lists the a-Si deposition technologies, which fully or partially fulfil the re - quirements to be considered for high volume PV manufacturing. Some of the most promising technologies that are closer to production-readiness, apart from LPCVD, are briefly discussed here. Plasma enhanced chem - ical vapour deposition (PECVD) is a well-proven technology in PV in - dustry to deposit dielectric passivation layers, and one of the most promising candidates for a-Si deposition. In fact, ITRPV predicts a fast adoption of this a-Si deposition technology in expense of LPCVD in the near-future [42]. PECVD deposition of a-Si layers offers higher deposi - tion rates in comparison to LPCVD technology, thereby promising cost-effectiveness. Another advantage of using PECVD is a possibility of in-situ doping of a-Si layers without any compromise to layer homoge - neity and deposition rates. One of the key challenges is to avoid blis - tering in thick layers (d ⊤100 nm), which are currently required for industrial TOPCon architecture due to an inherently high hydrogen concentration in the deposited a-Si layer. Although PECVD is loosely considered as a single sided deposition process, avoiding wrap-around of a-Si layers remains a technological milestone for equipment manufac - turers. Industrial tools allowing depositions in either batches [10,31,43] or inline mode [30,34] are available, and cell integration results are also published in literature [10,30]. In this paper, we assume batch-type PECVD tool for a-Si(n) deposition in all our calculations. PECVD-deposited a-Si layers require an additional high temperature annealing step to crystallize into poly-Si layers. Atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) is another potential technology to deposit intrinsic and doped a-Si layers in inline mode with high deposition rates [ 15,36,44]. The process utilizes thermal dissociation of silane (SiH 4 ) that is inserted in a heated chamber using injector heads. Since the chemical reactions occur directly at the heated substrate, APCVD is also expected to provide good single-sidedness. Furthermore, in-situ doping is reportedly easily ach - ieved by directly inserting doping precursors in the SiH 4  flow, and cell integration results are also reported [35]. In Fig. 7, normalized COO of the discussed deposition technologies is plotted against varying thick - ness of the a-Si layer. It can be observed that COO of the deposition process scales signif - icantly with the thickness of the a-Si layer. For LPCVD technology, process costs for the a-Si(n) reduce more with the deposition thickness as compared to the a-Si(i) layer. The cost advantage for thinner layers is, however, significantly higher for PECVD and APCVD deposited layers. For instance, the calculations show that COO reduction of almost 50% for PECVD and 65% for APCVD is achievable by lowering the a-Si layer thickness from 200 nm to 50 nm. The reduction of COO for PECVD a-Si is mainly due to a significant increase in throughput for lower thicknesses, which consequently leads to a significant reduction of process consumable costs. For APCVD, lower COO for thinner layers are mainly due to lower process consumables’ costs as these costs occupy significant fraction of total COO. Although current screen-printing technology still requires thicker (150–200 nm) poly-Si layers to avoid shunting losses, advances in paste developments and better understanding of contact formation are expected to drive further reduction of poly-Si thickness in future.

Two process routes are envisioned for each PECVD and APCVD based a-Si deposition technologies, mainly based upon the perspective of single-sidedness of the deposition process. The process routes PECVD TOPCon high �∆�ΘAPCVD TOPCon high represent the current knowledge where the wrap-around of a-Si(n) layer on front-side needs to be removed by using a single-sided etching (SSE) process. For PECVD TOPCon low �∆�ΘAPCVD TOPCon low, both a-Si deposition technologies are assumed to offer an excellent single-sidedness so that no SSE process is required after the high temperature annealing of the a-Si layer. In all four cases, the tunnel oxide is formed by coupling an UV excimer lamp array (UV-TO) [23] with the wet-chemical tool used for chemical edge isolation (CEI), BSG etching and ozone cleaning steps. For all TOPCon routes, alkaline texturing is followed by boron diffusion step to form p  emitter. For PECVD TOPCon high �∆�ΘAPCVD TOPCon high, BSG is kept intact during the wet-chemical step for rear- emitter removal in order to protect boron emitter against chemicals used in SSE process. After performing ozone cleaning in the same wet- chemical tool used for CEI/BSG processes, UV-TO is grown. After - wards, a 150 nm thick in-situ phosphorous doped a-Si layer is deposited on the rear-side either by using PECVD (batch-type) or APCVD tech - nology, with undesired wrap-around of a-Si layer on the front-side. The SSE process is performed to remove the wrap-around of a-Si, followed by BSG etching and subsequent ozone cleaning in the same wet-chemical tool. Here, it is assumed that the high temperature annealing process can be optimized in such a way that a thin thermal oxide grows on top of boron emitter, and that an excellent passivation of the textured (front) side can be achieved after PECVD AlO x /a-SiN x  layer deposition. For PECVD TOPCon low �∆�ΘAPCVD TOPCon low, CEI is followed by BSG etching as no SSE process is envisioned later for both of these process routes. After ozone cleaning and UV-TO growth, PECVD/APCVD a-Si(n) layers are deposited with excellent single-sidedness. Here, we assume the best-case scenario of no additional cleaning required be - tween PECVD/APCVD of a-Si(n) deposition and the subsequent thermal annealing step to form poly-Si(n) layer. However, it should be noted that contact of boron emitter with pins/trays used in the PECVD/APCVD deposition tools could demand an extra cleaning step (for example short HF/HCl dip) in large volume manufacturing. Thermal annealing to form poly-Si(n) layer is coupled with simultaneous growth of thin oxide on boron emitter, before deposition of PECVD AlO x /a-SiN x  on the front side. For all TOPCon routes, rear-side deposition of a-SiN x :H is per - formed on top of poly-Si(n) layer, followed by the screen-printing metallization using Ag pastes and fast-firing process to form bifacial solar cells. 5.Techno-economic analysis along the PV value chain 5.1.TCO of TOPCon routes against PERC For TCO calculations, average production efficiencies of 23.0% and 23.5% are assumed for PERC and TOPCon cells respectively, for a green- field production with an annual production output of 5000 MWp/a. To account for uncertainties in the performed bottom-up TCO calculation featuring numerous input parameters for each processing step, we ac - count an uncertainty margin of 10% for the COO result of each of the individual process steps that are already in use in mass production, i.e. all process steps for Bifacial p-PERC. To account for a higher uncertainty of the process and financial parameters, a higher COO uncertainty margin of 20% is assumed for each of the additional steps that are exclusive to the investigated industrial TOPCon concepts and not yet demonstrated in mass production. These process steps include BBr 3  diffusion, formation of UV-TO after CEI and BSG etching, a-Si deposi - tion, high temperature annealing, and the SSE process. For all TOPCon concepts, polysilicon layer thickness of 150 nm is assumed for TCO calculation. In Fig. 9, calculated All-in cell costs (left), All-in module costs (cen - ter), and LCOE (right) for the aforementioned bifacial p-PERC, and TOPCon process routes featuring LPCVD, PECVD and APCVD technol - ogies are shown. Looking at the calculated TCO values, TOPCon- concepts show 13.5–18.6% higher All-in Cell costs and 3.6–5.5% higher All-in Module costs in comparison to PERC benchmark, calcu - lating with equivalent module manufacturing costs for all concepts. The additional cost for TOPCon module is mainly related to a higher CAPEX and facility-related costs for the cell production facility, a significantly higher process consumable costs in the cell processing due to the addi - tional process steps required compared to a PERC cell, and the higher price of n-type as to the PERC p-type wafer substrate. From the TCO calculations up to module level, no clear winner among TOPCon con - cepts can be declared looking at the uncertainty margin.

In this study, a novel passivation contact structure based on nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiO x ) films was investigated. Tradi - tionally, poly silicon junctions in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells possess exceptional junction characteristics, but current losses are noted due to their optical absorption if they are applied in solar cell devices. In this study, we replaced the poly-Si layer in TOPCon solar cells with nc-SiO x  to enhance trans - parency. By employing the nc-SiO x  layer, effective surface passivation, carrier selectivity, electrical properties and optical transmission can be used to improve, all are vitally important in devise operation. We optimized the deposited nc-SiO x  layer on an ultra-thin (~1.5 nm) silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) tunnel oxide layer to improve recombination current density and carrier lifetime. The passivation characteristics were improved by varying the annealing temperature and thickness of the nc-SiO x  layer. The 50 nm thick nc-SiO x  layer was capable of yielding a high implied open-circuit voltage (i-V oc ) of 739 mV and low contact resistivity (  ) of 14.2 (m/cm 2 ) in addition to a low depleted recombination current density (J o ) of 1.1 fA/cm 2  with a post-deposition annealing temperature up to 950  ◦ C. Improved passivation characteristics are the result of a more prominent annealing temperature. Our proposed technique has immense potential for achieving higher efficiency for fabricating various structures of TOPCon solar cells. As per AFORST Het simulation results by using nc-SiO x  for TOPCon structure, we got V oc  of 761.5 mV, J sc  of 43.5 mA/cm 2 , FF of 83%, and    of 27.49%, respectively.    1.Introduction Currently, photovoltaic energy production is considered the subject of significant research attention owing to its environmentally friendly, globally consented, and renewable characteristics. Crystalline silicon (c- Si) is commonly used to fabricate solar cells because of its abundance in nature, low cost, and excellent performance. Presently, above 95% of overall photovoltaic production is shared by c-Si solar [1]. To further enhance the conversion efficiency of c-Si solar cells, the minority charge- carrier recombination losses at the interfaces between the Si absorber and electrodes must be reduced while maintaining efficient majority charge-carrier extraction [2–4]. Recently, various passivating contact technologies, such as polycrystalline Si on oxide (POLO), and poly-Si- based passivating contacts on thin oxides and tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have demonstrated excellent passivation and carrier selectivity characteristics [5–10]. Thin buffer layers of SiO x  capped with doped poly-Si or semi-insulating poly-Si (SIPOS) approaches were first investigated during the 1980s [11–13]. Better passivation performance was observed with an approach using SIPOS alloyed with oxygen compared to pure poly-Si layers, but the produced thin films were too resistive for current extraction from solar cells [12–14]. Recently, enhanced solar cell characteristics have been reported using similar approaches on the rear side for two-sided contact solar cells and inter - digitated back contact (IBC) devices without oxygen alloying [15–21]. With exceptional passivating junction characteristics for the front side contact solar cell, the rear side contacting scheme is the factor limiting efficiency. To outspread the application of passivating contacts for the rear side, additional requirements must be met. To overcome parasitic  *Corresponding authors at: 2066, Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, Suwon 16419, Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea. E-mail addresses: quddamah@skku.edu (M.Q. Khokhar), phamduyphong@tdtu.edu.vn (D.P.

To minimize absorption loss, we report a novel rear side- area passivating electron contact that improves the transparency by replacing a part of the doped poly-Si layer. The novel contact structure includes a thin thermally grown SiO 2  layer on the c-Si wafer surface capped by a phosphorus-doped nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiO x ). The plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system of (SNTEK company) with a frequency of 13.56 MHz, was used for the growth of the nc-SiO x  layer. The PECVD process has the advantage that it allows single-sided deposition instead of the wrap-around deposition observed during the low-pressure chemical vapor deposition process [22]. Moreover, the temperature stability of passivation is improved owing to the presence of a thermally grown SiO 2  layer, resulting in a broad thermal processing window. A wide bandgap material, nc-SiO x , was introduced to reduce optical absorption. The optical and electrical characteristics could be varied by changing the oxygen content. The conductive properties of the n-doped nc-SiO x  were found at low oxygen concentrations with phosphorus doping. The annealing process is an important process for activating the dopant and developing films required for emitter contact. During the annealing process, the surface morphology varied throughout. The Si precipitates into small grains of nano-Si, while the O 2  acts as insulation and forms SiO 2  on the grain boundaries [23]. The consequences of O 2  assimilation are the result of a reduction in grain growth. For higher O 2  concentrations, Carrier transport is resulted by tunneling via thin SiO x  shells for higher O 2  concentrations [24]. The junction properties were analyzed by varying the thickness and annealing time of the deposited layer. Hydrogen passivation in forming gas annealing (FGA) was investigated after the influence of each parameter. Additionally, our research focused on the experimental de - signs to explain the physical mechanisms accountable for melioration and optimization of the passivation characteristics of symmetric struc - tures using a Quasi-Steady-State Photoconductance (QSSPC) measure - ment system. 2.Experimental Czochralski-grown phosphorus-doped n-type wafers (200 µm thick with 3–5 -cm,) were used in this study. The first step was the removal of surface defects by employing an etching solution comprising sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 70–80  ◦ C for approximately 10 min. Further, samples were consecutively cleaned by employing the standard RCA-1 and RCA-2 cleaning processes to remove organic and metallic impu - rities [25]. Afterward, the samples were dipped in HCl solution and then in HF solution for 2 min each. Finally, the deionized water was used for the cleaning of samples. The cleaned samples were immediately placed in a thermal oxide furnace. The thermally growth of a SiO 2  tunnel layer with a thickness of approximately 1.5 nm on the front and back sides of the cleaned Si wafer was conducted in a furnace. The SiO 2  layer was grown by thermal oxidation of the cleaned silicon wafer at a tempera - ture of 600  ◦ C with an O 2  flow rate of 10 L/min for 30 min. Finally, the samples were detached from the thermal furnace for the deposition of nc-SiO x . The deposition was performed using PECVD in the presence of SiH 4 , H 2 , CO 2,  and PH 3  gases at a temperature of approximately 110  ◦ C, and thicknesses of 30, 40, and 50 nm were obtained. For deposition of nc-SiO x , we used 1.5 T pressure and 35 mW/cm 2  power, respectively. Optimized PECVD deposition conditions of phosphorus-doped nc-SiO x  material were reported in our previous paper [26]. Electrical and optical properties of n-type nc-SiO x  were optimized by introducing SiH 4 , H 2 , CO 2 , and PH 3  at ratios of 4, 500, 2, and 0.08, respectively [26]. All samples synthesized in this study were exposed to post-deposition annealing (PDA) at 850, 900, 950, or 1000  ◦ C for more crystallization. Finally, FGA was performed for 2 h at 400  ◦ C. The parameters used to obtain passivated nc-SiO x  contacts are listed in Table 1. The procedure is described in detail below. The symmetric structures synthesized through these two approaches are shown in Fig. 1. The ultrathin SiO 2  tunnel oxide layer and nc-SiO x  layer with various thicknesses were confirmed through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and spectroscopic ellips - ometry (VASE, JA Woollam). The passivation characteristics were evaluated using a QSSPC measurement system (WCT Sintron, 120). The transfer length method (TLM) was used to obtain the contact resistivity (  c ). We used the TLM method by etching the polysilicon to measure the contact resistivity. To investigate the current pathway, the region be - tween the TLM pads was repetitively etched in SF 6 /O 2 /Ar plasma using the aluminum pads as an etching mask, and the samples were measured after each etch process by TLM. The plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system of (SNTEK company) with a frequency of 13.56 MHz and thermal furnace of EM TECH company are used during the experiment. Structural characteristics were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Ramboss 500i, Dongwoo Optron Co., Ltd.). X-ray photo - electron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out on a Physical Electronics PHI5000 Versa Probe II photoelectron spectrometer with a mono-chromated Al-Ka source operated in a high-power mode at 100 W. To increase the probing depth, the takeoff angle was set to 85. The Si2p peak was measured with a pass energy of 5.85 eV and 25 meV/step. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Observation of structure characteristic and passivation characteristics at various thicknesses of nc-SiO x  on different annealing temperature The HRTEM image of the ultrathin SiO 2  layer capped with the nc- SiO x  layer observed at a scale of 1 nm is shown in Fig. 2. The thickness of this layer was recorded as 1.5 nm. The SiO 2  layer with a thickness greater than 1.6 nm has previously been reported to exhibit poor passivation properties due to the reduced degree of dopant diffusion from nc-SiO x  to the c-Si wafer owing to the thicker SiO 2  layer [27]. The structural analyses of such nc-SiO x  layers using Raman spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 3a and b. Crystalline volume factor (X c ) as shown in Fig. 3c was derived from the data using the relation X c  =I 518,519 /( I518,519  +I 480 ), in which I 518, 519  and I 480  are the integrated areas extracted from Gaussian fitting at 518, 519 and 480 cm �1 , respectively. We can see in Fig. 3a that the nc-SiO x  layer structure before annealing appears to present a mix phase of crystalline and amorphous, which is character - ized by a Raman peak at 480 cm �1  and 518 cm �1 , mainly visible at thicknesses above the value of 50 nm thick. On the contrary, for thick - nesses in the range of 30–50 nm, the structure can be regarded essen - tially as an amorphous phase, as defined by a broad spectral range centered around 480 cm �1 . It has been known that the growth of crys - talline phase in silicon films during plasma deposition is generally initiated through a first incubation amorphous phase followed by  Table 1 Parameters and results of symmetric structure for SiO x /nc-SiO x  passivated contacts after FGA.

Khokhar et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             nucleation and, finally, crystalline phase formation [27–29]. In this process, nucleation-growth aggregation plays an important role to prompt subsequent crystalline particles. As shown in Fig. 3b, raman spectra showing a clear tendency towards lower amorphous fraction with increasing temperature. As shown in Fig. 3b, the crystalline phase of n-nc-SiO x  layer can be initiated and more prominent at all thickness of 30, 40, and 50 nm after annealing at 950  ◦ C in thermal furnace. We done Raman spectroscopy only at 950  ◦ C because we got ameliorated passivation properties at 950  ◦ C. Already in the as-deposited state, the Raman spectrum is dominated by the transverse optical (TO) c-Si phonon with a peak around 518 cm �1 . However, the signal still shows a pronounced shoulder at wavenumbers between 400 cm �1  and 510 cm �1 , which can be attributed to amorphous Si. After 1-hour higher annealing temperature at 950  ◦ C, the amorphous fraction is decreasing further and lateral inhomogeneities vanish (not shown here). The amorphous contribution almost disappears for a dwell temperature of 950  ◦ C, meaning that the layer is almost fully crystalline. The annealing temperature plays significant role in prompting the rapid growth of crystalline phase in the nc-SiO x  layer even with a low or higher thick - ness. Based on the nucleation kinetics, the crystalline phase may grow rapidly and increase in thickness. This is observable in Fig. 3c where the value of X c  increases with thickness of nc-SiO x  layer as well as increases with annealing temperature. Examination of the chemical state of the silicon by XPS depicted an oxidation induced splitting of the Si2p peak as described in Fig. 4. Investigation of the oxidation states was executed by deconvolution of the silicon 2p peak. It is known as a rule of thumb that the peak shifts 1 eV per oxidation state. The exact parameters were taken from Ref. 37 (Si 1+ : 0.9 eV, Si 2+ : 1.7 eV, Si 3+ : 2.7 eV, Si 4+ : 3.7 eV). The deconvolution of the peak revealed the presence of silicon suboxides in the material. The observed evolution of the Si n+ distribution with 50 nm thick layer of nc-SiO x , despite the fixed oxygen content in the present study, indicates a phase separation. Deviation in the passivation char - acteristics of samples deposited by nc-SiO x  were analyzed. The passiv - ation properties at thicknesses of 30, 40, and 50 nm were equated. Then, the nc-SiO x  deposited samples were annealed at various temperatures in the range of 850–1000  ◦ C. The results of the PDA clarified the breaking of the silicon-hydrogen bond as well as accompanying hydrogen diffu - sion within the c-Si substrate and phosphorous diffusion via the tunnel oxide layer within the n-type substrate. As mentioned earlier, the passivation quality was enhanced by the insertion of the tunnel oxide layer. In this study, passivation of the tunnel oxide junction structure was observed to be excellent for the sample subjected to 950  ◦ C thermal annealing. However, the passivation quality decreased with heat treat - ment above 950  ◦ C, which means at 1000  ◦ C. This is reportedly attrib - uted to the local disruption of the tunnel oxide layer. This disruption is not easy to observe through TEM and XPS measurements due to the fine area analysis on the atomic scale. A bifacial structure such as used for the QSSPC measurement was employed. Substantial improvements in passivation characteristics were observed after PDA when the nc-SiO x  layer thickness was approximately 50 nm at 950  ◦ C. As the nc-SiO x  layer thickness approached 50 nm, considerable improvements were detected in both lifetime (  eff ) and i-V OC . Fig. 5(a) depicts the   eff  and i-V OC  of the deposited samples from the evaluated thicknesses as a function of the post-deposition annealing temperature (T PDA ). Both   eff  and i-V OC  of the deposited annealed samples were found to be more prominent as compared to the as-deposited sample. The results of   eff  and i-V OC  improved at all examined thicknesses as the annealing temperature increased to 950  ◦ C, after which they diminished for higher annealing temperature around 1000  ◦ C. Fig. 5(b) demonstrates the J o  of the three different nc-SiO x  thickness samples in response to the T PDA . J o  dimin - ished with an increase in annealing temperature up to 950  ◦ C and then J o  starts to increase as the annealing temperature increased further up to 1000  ◦ C. Particularly high increases in   eff  and i-V OC  as well as re - ductions in J o  compared to the as-deposited state of the nc-SiO x  layer, at the annealing temperature of approximately 950  ◦ C, were ascribed to the ameliorated chemical passivation of ultrathin SiO 2  due to the decreased field-effect passivation owing to carrier selectivity [28]. The best passivation characteristics were observed for the deposited sample with the 50 nm thick nc-SiO x  layer after the PDA at 950  ◦ C, with the highest lifetime and i-V OC  of ~2446   s and ~728 mV, respectively, and lowest J o  of 1.33 fA/cm 2 .

The highest lifetime and the i-V OC  were achieved up to 2.918 ms and of 739 mV on 50 nm thick nc-SiO x  layer  Fig. 3.Raman spectra of n-nc-SiO x  layers: a) Before and b) after annealing at 950  ◦ C; and c) the crystalline volume factors (X c ) of n-nc-SiO x  layers before and after annealing at 950  ◦ C as a function of thickness.

Khokhar et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             which exposed to post-deposition annealing (PDA) at 950  ◦ C, when FGA treatment was performed for nc-SiO x  layers with thicknesses of 30–50 nm. The measured lifetime and the i-V OC  were extracted at the injection level (1.0E +15  cm �3 ). in that case, our value highest passivation value of lifetime comes around 2.918 ms and of 739 mV at 50 nm, as shown in lifetime spectrum diagram Fig. 6(c). A substantial reduction in J o  to 1.1 fA/cm 2  was observed at the 50 nm thick nc-SiO x  layer which exposed to post-deposition annealing (PDA) at 950  ◦ C and then J o  starts to increase as the annealing temperature increased further up to 1000  ◦ C. In this study, passivation of the tunnel oxide junction structure was observed to be excellent for the sample subjected to 950  ◦ C thermal annealing. However, the passivation quality decreased with heat treatment above 950  ◦ C, which means at 1000  ◦ C. FGA treatment induced a substantial decrease in interface defect density (D it ), which enhanced passivation. The highest lifetime and the i-V OC  were achieved due to the hydrogen passivation process means after FGA. It is thought that dangling silicon bonds in the interface and tunnel oxide layer were passivated by hydrogen. To improve the passivation quality of the tunnel oxide layer, it is important to control the properties and stoichiometry of the tunnel oxide layer. The FGA treatment on the phosphorus-doped nc-SiO x  layer increased hydrogen activation on both sides of the nc-SiO x  layer as well as of the tunnel oxide interface. This treatment permitted the best passivation at 50 nm thick phosphorus-doped nc-SiO x  layer. FGA led to a minimal J o  value, showing that this structure would produce a higher- efficiency TOPCon cell. Fig. 6(a) shows improvements in   eff  and i-V OC  following FGA treatment for deposited samples at different thicknesses. Both   eff  and i-V OC  values increased at higher nc-SiO x  layer thicknesses and higher T PDA  values. Fig. 6(b) depicts the change in J o  after FGA at similar conditions as above. J o  was found to be as little as ~1.1 fA/cm 2  after FGA. We used the minority-carrier lifetime measurement as initially rough parameters to estimate the passivation quality of the resulting wafer surface. Fig. 6(c) shows the effective minority carrier lifetime data of the initial passivated wafer with various thicknesses of the nc-SiO x  layer which exposed to post-deposition annealing (PDA) at 950  ◦ C. 3.3.Analysis of SiO x /nc-SiO x  contact passivation properties (J o  and  · ) and (D it  and i-V oc ) To examine the passivated contact characteristics at the minimum J o  value, we first identified low   contact  values, which permit selective carrier transport by a particular SiO x  tunnel layer. To analyze the impact of the leading SiO x /nc-SiO x  passivated contacts, nc-SiO x  layers were deposited on both sides of the SiO x  layers, and thereafter, FGA was performed. The J o  values were extracted using QSSPC for the SiO x /nc- SiO x  contacts. After the FGA on SiO x /nc-SiO x , a considerable enhance - ment of the overall quality was achieved. Thermal annealing at 950  ◦ C and FGA at 400  ◦ C resulted in the lowest values of J o  and   , but at 1000  ◦ C thermal annealing and FGA at 400  ◦ C resulted in the lowest values of    and the highest value of J o . The results presented in Fig. 7(a) demonstrate that the total contact resistance declined gradually with increasing annealing temperature, whereas the drop was precipitous for the sample annealed around 1000  ◦ C. Thus, this is considered indirect evidence of local disruption of the tunnel oxide layer. Based on the total resistance, the resistivity of the tunnel oxide layer was deducted to separate the layers of the sample structure by considering the thickness and sheet resistance measurements of the nc-SiOx layer and the sub - strate properties. The improvement in J o  the value for the 50 nm SiO x / nc-SiO x  passivated contact annealed at 950  ◦ C was more prominent compared to samples annealed at 850  ◦ C and 900  ◦ C. Passivated contact with FGA samples ensued in diminished values (1.1 fAcm �2 ) at 50 nm, showing limited surface recombination as well as improved passivation compared to annealing at 850  ◦ C (8.17 fAcm �2 ) and 900  ◦ C (1.6 fAcm �2 ). For SiO x /nc-SiO x  passivated contact FGA, an improvement was seen at 400  ◦ C, yielding the lowest J o  and    values. As J o  and    values decreased, tunneling efficiency increased. Fig. 7(a) shows J o  and    of the deposited samples with various nc-SiO x  thicknesses as a function of T PDA . For all thicknesses, J o  and    values declined as annealing tem - perature increased up to 950  ◦ C. Fig. 7(b) depicts the comparison of both J o  and    results with those of other research groups worldwide. Comparing our results with those of other research groups such as Josua et al. [30] reveals that we achieved improved passivation results. In both  Fig. 6.(a).

Khokhar et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             studies, the main aim was to improve TOPCon solar cell efficiency using nc-SiO x . However, the difference lies in the SiO x  growth method and thickness as well as deposition temperatures. The novelty of our results arose from different fabrication methods and treatment steps. Josua et al. used a chemical process for oxidation and a thin nc-SiO x  layer, thus requiring different annealing times and temperatures. In this study, we optimized the thickness of evaluated layers, N 2  atmosphere annealing, and FGA temperature and time. To evaluate the passivation contact properties, maximum i-V oc  values and low interface trap density (D it ) were examined as they permit selective carrier transport by a particular SiO x  tunnel layer. The D it  of the tunnel oxide layer was quantitatively assessed by C-V measurement. The D it  was studied to evaluate the effect of SiO x  and nc-SiO x  quality on surface passivation. D it  is evaluated at the interface of SiO x /nc-SiO x ; the lower the D it  value, the higher the i-V oc . Fig. 8 confirms a decrease of the D it  due to the Si-O bonding transition induced by post-annealing. Further, the D it  of about 1.23 ×10 9  cm �2 /eV was achieved due to the H passivation process means FGA treatment. It is thought that dangling silicon bonds in the interface and tunnel oxide layer were passivated by hydrogen. To improve the passivation quality of the tunnel oxide layer, it is important to control the properties and stoichiometry of the tunnel oxide layer. An i-V oc  of 739 mV was achieved when the D it  was 1.23 ×10 9  cm �2 /eV, as shown in Fig. 8. However, the i-V oc  fell to 698 mV when D it  increased to 2.26 ×10 9  cm �2 /eV, after which i-V oc  continued to decrease. Reduction in D it  reduces the probability of carrier recombi - nation which in turn influences the i-V oc  to improve. Thermal annealing at 1000  ◦ C and FGA at 400  ◦ C of 50 nm thick nc-SiO x  films resulted in the lowest i-V oc  and highest D it . But the thermal annealing at 950  ◦ C and FGA at 400  ◦ C of 50 nm thick nc-SiO x  films resulted in the highest i-V oc  and lowest D it . For D it , the decrease in i-V oc  owing to leakage became noticeable as the temperature rose. Therefore, the temperature charac - teristics of the contact solar cell are more sensitive to D it  [10,16,29–34]. 4.Conclusion This study aimed to improve passivation by employing an amended nc-SiO x  layer to enhance the implementation of nc-SiO x  for back surface films in high-performance TOPCon solar cells. We achieved improved passivation properties by applying a nc-SiO x  layer relatively thinner than that described in the current study. The improved thickness of the nc-SiO x  layer synthesized by PECVD was 50 nm at T PDA  with annealing at 950  ◦ C and FGA at 400  ◦ C. The Si–H bonds are broken by the PDA process that resulted in H diffusion into the c-Si substrate as well as reconstitution of the ultrathin SiO x  tunnel oxide layer owing to the establishment of pinholes. The most beneficial passivation properties were found after FGA because this process directly relinquished H into both the nc-SiO x  layer as well as the tunnel oxide layer. This research provides in-depth knowledge for future studies on the improvement of nc-SiO x  layers, which can assist the fabrication of TOPCon solar cells. nc- SiO x  with a thickness of 50 nm exhibited lower sheet resistivity as well as beneficial metal contact. Moreover, the T PDA  was diminished to mitigate high-temperature damage and achieve reduced costs. As per AFORST Het simulation results by using nc-SiO x  for TOPCon structure, we got V oc  of 761.5 mV, J sc  of 43.5 mA/cm 2 , FF of 83% and    of 27.49%, respectively.

Ltd, Haining, China   ABSTRACT   Plated Ni/Cu/Ag contacts offer the possibility to significantly reduce silver consumption for tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells. This work demonstrates industrial bifacial TOPCon solar cells with plated Ni/Cu/Ag metallization achieving champion solar cell efficiencies of up to 24.0%. The influence of reduced poly-Si thickness down to 60 nm of the TOPCon rear side on the open circuit voltage (V oc ) is analysed and the impact of laser-induced damage during laser contact opening (LCO) is characterized. Furthermore, mitigation strategies to systematic fill factor losses are developed including laser-induced nano-roughness within the LCO to increase contact adhesion and current-annealing to improve contact resistance.    1.Introduction Resource availability becomes an increasingly important topic in the transition of a PV production market heading towards a multi terawatt production capacity in the next decade. Especially, silver for solar cell metallization turns out to be one of the critical materials in terms of availability and material costs [1,2]. The dependency on silver will even increase in an anticipated technology evolution from p-type passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) to n-type solar cell concepts such as het - erojunction or tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cell in industry. State-of-the-art n-type solar cell designs with printed metal contacts typically require pastes on front and rear side with high silver content. Laser structured and plated Ni/Cu contacts are an industrially feasible alternative to significantly reduce silver consumption for p- or n- type silicon solar cell designs. Recent works demonstrated successful integration of plated contacts for PERC [3], SHJ [4], PERT [5] and TOPCon. Grübel et al. [6,7] introduced a process sequence to realize bifacial TOPCon solar cells with plated Ni/Cu/Ag contacts. This sequence is applied in this work to metallize industrial TOPCon solar cells. This allowed to reduce the silver consumption to 4 mg per wafer or 0.6 mg/W compared to 130 mg for screen printed TOPCon solar cells in 2022 according to the International Technology Roadmap for Photo - voltaic (ITRPV) [8]. The works of Arya [9] and Grübel [10] also indicate that the application of plated contacts could enable to reduce the poly-Si thick - ness of the TOPCon rear side enabling further reductions in production cost by increased throughput of the poly-Si deposition. This work demonstrates the application of laser structured and plated metal contacts on industrial type bifacial TOPCon solar cells with decreased poly-Si thickness on the TOPCon rear side down to approxi - mately 60 nm. Furthermore, the aim of this work is to characterize the impact of the laser contact opening on the contact recombination of TOPCon rear side with reduced poly-Si thickness and develop strategies to ensure low contact resistances and reliable contact adhesion even on planarized surfaces. 2.Experimental The TOPCon precursors used in this work were processed in an in - dustrial R&D line and feature a variation in poly-Si thickness on the TOPCon rear side with thickness of 60 nm, 90 nm, 125 nm and 140 nm. The poly-Si thicknesses were confirmed with scanning electron micro - scope measurements at cross sections of the final solar cells after metallization. The fabrication process of the precursors is similar to the description of Grübel et al. [11]. The wafer area was 267.85 cm 2 .The metallization process of the TOPCon solar cell precursors was either silver/silver-aluminum (Ag/AgAl) screen printing at the R&D line of the supplier or laser defined plated contacts fabricated at Fraunhofer ISE. The plated solar cells feature an UV (355 nm laser wavelength)  *Corresponding author. E-mail address: sven.kluska@ise.fraunhofer.de (S. Kluska).

The LCO pulse pitch within the finger line was set to 90% of the LCO diameter. The finger lines featured a finger pitch of 1 mm and 9 busbar were applied with a busbar width of 50  Δ m in average. After LCO formation the laser damage was cured in an industrial type fast firing process (FFO) using a fast firing system by Rehm Thermal Systems with belt speed of 6 m/min and a set peak temperature of 870  ◦ C. Laser- induced and native oxide layer within the LCO were removed with a single side 1.5% HF pre-treatment (30 s) prior to the single side inline plating process. Lab type single lane inline plating tools similar to the In Cell Plate platform supplied by Rena Technologies GmbH were used to plate a stack of Ni (~0.5  Δ m)/Cu(5Θ10  Δ m)/Ag(<0.5  Δ m). The nickel (Nimate PV) and copper (Cupracid PV 5Θ2) electrolyte used in this experiment were supplied by Atotech Group. Plating on the n-type TOPCon and p-type emitter side was performed with light-induced plating (current controlled) and forward bias plating (current controlled), respectively. The set current density for nickel deposition was 2.5 A/dm 2  (front side) and 2.2 A/dm 2  (rear side) and for copper 15.2 A/dm 2  (front side) and 11.5 A/dm 2  (rear side). The silver capping layer was chemically deposited in an immersion plating process. The experiment design is illustrated in Fig. 1. Solar cells with either plated or screen printed metallization were fabricated for each poly-Si thickness. Furthermore, LCO test samples were processed using LCO line patterns with increasing laser pulse energy similar to Arya et al. [9]. Each processing group featured at least 10 solar cells per metallization. The fabricated solar cells were characterized using an industrial type IV flasher with a non reflective chuck and a grid neglecting contacting unit (see appendix A of [12]). After IV testing laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO) [13] was applied to the solar cells. During the process a laser scans the over the cells front side which causes a very high local injection of charge carriers. At the same time a negative bias voltage is applied to the contacts of the cell. The high injection and the negative bias voltage cause high current densities through the contact interface, which are responsible for contact formation and hence improve the metal semiconductor contact of the cells. The champion solar cells were externally characterized at Fraunhofer ISE Callab using calibrated IV measurements with a reflective chuck and a grid neglecting contacting unit. Please note that the champion solar cells featured exactly the same processing sequence as all other solar cells and were selected after IV flash testing without any modification before the calibrated measurement. Furthermore, all solar cells were characterized using electroluminescence (EL) and pho - toluminescence (PL) imaging. EL imaging at a current of 10 A was used in this work to indicate regions with hindered electrical current distri - bution. Locally increased series resistances are among other reasons one of the most common origins of decreased EL intensity in these areas. Photoluminescence measurements were performed at 1 sun illumina - tion. Locally decreased PL intensities are used in this work to locate regions of increased recombination activity. 3.Results ����discussion 3.1.Analysis of champion solar cells The IV results of the champion solar cells with each metallization approach are summarized in Table 1. The narrow front side contact width (~15  Δ m contact width, 5  Δ m LCO width) of the plated TOPCon solar cells allowed low contact shading (+0.3 mA/cm 2  compared to SP reference) and low front side contact recombination (+10 mV compared to SP reference). The low contact resistivity of plated nickel on boron doped emitters and phosphorous doped TOPCon allowed low series resistance-induced losses of the fill factor (FF) even for the narrow front side laser contact opening width of 5  Δ m.  Fig. 1.Cross sections of the fabricated TOPCon solar cells based on industrial TOPCon precursors with variations in poly-Si thickness on the rear side. Please note that all solar cells featured on front and rear side either plated or screen printed contacts.

Kluska et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3.2.V oc  characteristics and contact recombination Fig. 2 shows the V oc  distribution of the solar cells for each metalli - zation approach related to the poly-Si thickness variation for the TOP - Con rear side. The V oc  advantage of the plated solar cells compared to the screen printed ones is in a range of 5Θ10 mV. Grübel et al. [11] demonstrated that the main limitation in V oc  of plated TOPCon solar cells (similar to the one used in this experiment) is caused by contact recombination of the front side emitter contact. Grübel estimates the saturation current density of a laser ablated and plated emitter contact to be in the range of 1000Θ3000 fA/cm 2 . The following section shows that the contact recombination contribution of the TOPCon contact is in this work for laser ablation close to the ablation threshold usually below these values even for reduced poly-Si thickness of 60 nm. Calibrated Photoluminescence imaging of the implied V oc  with and w/o laser contact openings are used to evaluate the LCO induced rear side contact recombination. Fig. 3 shows the LCO-induced iV oc  loss (after LCO and FFO annealing) for test structures with three different poly-Si thicknesses and increasing laser pulse energy. Please note that all LCO pulse energies in Fig. 3 provide a full area LCO with an opening width of 12Θ18  Δ m, which are all applicable for solar cell fabrication. The marked data refers to a similar LCO used for solar cell fabrica - tion. No significant iV oc  reduction was measured for the 125 nm poly Si thickness even for large LCO pulse energies. The threshold in laser pulse energy which leads to LCO-induced iV oc  losses is seen for poly Si thickness of 90 nm and below. However, the applicable range of LCO pulse energies with no significant iV oc  degradation is for all poly-Si thicknesses still well above the ablation threshold. The applied LCO pulse energy of the solar cells in Fig. 3 is for all poly-Si thickness in a region of no significant iV oc  reduction. The LCO design of the PL test structures featured a contact fraction of ~1%. The iV oc  degradation in Fig. 3 in the range of ~1Θ8 mV correlates to a saturation current density of the rear side contact J 0,LCO  of 200Θ1500 fA/cm 2 , respectively. This range in J 0,LCO  equals the findings of Arya et al. [9] on similar poly-Si thicknesses. However, the data of this work suggests that even for 60 nm poly-Si thickness low iV oc  degradation κ1 mV (referring to J 0,LCO  κ200 fA/cm 2 ) are possible. This suggests that even thinner poly-Si thicknesses would be applicable for TOPCon solar cells with a laser structured and plated metallization approach without significant V oc  losses. 3.3.Series resistance and fill factor characteristics The IV measurements of the whole data set of plated solar cells revealed in this experiment large FF spreading in the range of 50Θ83%. Optical inspection and EL measurements allowed to categorize solar cells with decreased FF compared to the screen printed references. Two reasons for this could be identified for the plated groups. First, solar cells with locally low contact adhesion on the rear side, leading to significant drops in FF well below 80% and large areas with low EL intensity. Second, minor deviations in FF in the range of 77Θ82% compared to the plated champion solar cell and local spots with low EL intensity. These kinds of defects were sensitive on LECO current annealing, which lead to an increase in FF by 1Θ2%abs. In the following the microscopic origins and mitigation strategies for both error types are discussed. 3.3.1.Nano-roughness as adhesion promoter of plated contacts on etched back surfaces Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize differences of the LCO for solar cells with and without contact adhesion failures. Fig. 4 shows false color SEM images (in Viridis color scale [14]) of represen - tative LCO for each case. The silicon surface of solar cells with contact adhesion failures shows no significant exploits laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) within the LCO Fig. 4 a). The LCO of solar cells with no contact adhesion failures and FF above 80% shows LIPSS Fig. 4 b). The origin of these differences in LCO formation are still under investigation. Further characterizations demonstrated that LIPSS can also be manufactured on samples with a planarized surface after alkaline chemical edge isolation Fig. 4 c). Different approaches are known from literature to achieve a reliable contact adhesion for plated contacts on silicon. The most famous ap - proaches are plating on metallic seed layers (e.g. PVD metal layers such as TiPdAg, Ti, Mo), galvanic surface displacement (electrochemically deposited seeds such as Pd [15] or Ni [5] silicidation of the nickel-silicon interface [16], and/or laser-induced nano-roughness [17]. The last one exploits LIPSS, which result from interference of ultra-short laser pulses on the pyramid texture of a solar cell. The classification and analysis of the solar cells with missing contact adhesion in this experiment was performed before current annealing.

Kluska et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Therefore, the only mechanism to achieve contact adhesion was the laser-induced nano-roughness visible in Fig. 4 (b,c). Further in - vestigations are ongoing how sample properties such as surface morphology, passivation layer and LCO parameters are influencing the appearance of LIPSS on chemically polished TOPCon surfaces. The current results demonstrate that the approach of laser-induced roughness for increased contact adhesion is applicable even on pla - narized surfaces but that a proper process control is necessary to avoid contact adhesion failures. Furthermore, it is expected that the combi - nation of LIPPS and another approach such as annealing-induced sili - cidation are beneficial to improve contact adhesion reliability on planarized surfaces in an industrial environment. 3.3.2.Current annealing induced contact resistance improvement of plated contacts The second type of decreased FF is summarized in the orange data in Fig. 5 and shows a range of 78Θ81%: The application of a current annealing process (LECO) lead to a mean improvement in FF of about 1.5% abs . Series resistance (R s ) characterization showed that the R s  could be reduced by about 0.3 Πcm 2  after LECO with lower variation in R s . No significant changes in grid resistance were measured before and after LECO. The detailed analysis of the V oc , and series resistance (R s ) change of each cell after LECO is presented in Fig. 6. A decrease in R s  correlates to a slight decrease in V oc . The same is true for decreased R s  correlating to slight decrease in pFF in the range of up to 0.15% abs  (not shown here). These results indicate that the origin of the series resistance/FF im - provements also lead to an increased recombination activity (decreased V oc /pFF). Further local imaging techniques are used to analyse local changes in electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) before/after LECO. Fig. 7 shows EL and PL measurements before and after LECO for 3 representative solar cells with plated contacts. A selection of local fea - tures are marked to compare the changes before/after LECO annealing. Feature F1 shows a larger cloudy area with low EL intensity before LECO with 2 vertical lines with increased EL intensity, which correlate to busbar positions on the rear side. After LECO the contacting improves resulting in an increased and more homogeneous EL signal in F1.

Feature F2 shows local regions with decreased EL intensity with shapes related to automation handling marks and larger cloudy areas in the surrounding. Most of the features in F2 disappear after LECO. Only local spots with decreased intensity remain in F2 after LECO. These local spots are not visible in PL before LECO but appear in PL after LECO. Feature F3 and F4 in EL are also correlated to automation handling marks. Again, the EL intensity in these areas is increased and homoge - nized after LECO. In contrast to F2 the PL shows no change before/after  Fig. 7.EL and PL measurements of three representative TOPCon solar cells with plated contacts before and after LECO.   S. Kluska et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   LECO. EL characterization shows mainly improvements in local features after LECO. The origin of this annealing-induced FF improvement is expected to be caused by changes in the contact resistance of the nickel- silicon interface in these areas. At the same time PL imaging reveals that at some (but not all) positions the improvements in EL signal correlate with local decrease in PL (new local recombination features) after LECO. LECO is known to change the contact interface by creating metal- silicon spikes due to locally increased temperatures during the current annealing [18]. These local temperature increase can act twofold at the NiΘSi interface. Temperatures above 200  � C would enable nickel silicide growth assuming an oxide free NiΘSi interface. The locally formed sili - cide spike would improve contact resistance (increased EL signal, FF increase) and -depending on its depth-locally increase contact recom - bination (decreased PL, decreased V oc ). Especially on the emitter side this would also result in local non-ohmic shunts (pFF decrease) [19]. Furthermore, the high local current densities in the range of MA/cm 2  [18] are likely to cause an electrical breakdown of remaining interface oxide, oxi-nitride or nitride layers [20] at the NiΘSi interface [21] resulting in increased contact area (decreased contact resistance, increased contact recombination). 4.Conclusion This work demonstrated that the application of a plated Ni/Cu/Ag metallization approach is able to significantly reduce silver consumption for industrial TOPCon solar cells and at the same time achieve high cell efficiencies of up to 24%. Furthermore, the application of UV-ps LCO allows to achieve low contact recombination on the TOPCon rear side. This held to be true even for reduced poly-Si thickness down to 60 nm. A maximum V oc  of up to 708 mV was achieved on 60 nm poly-Si using a plated metallization approach. A detailed study of the rear side contact recombination revealed the potential to further reduce the poly-Si thickness on the TOPCon rear side for the case of plated metal con - tacts. Microscopic analysis allowed to identify laser-induced nano structures within the LCO as crucial element to achieve contact adhesion of plated contacts on planarized surfaces. Furthermore, it could be shown that the application of current-induced annealing by the LECO process improves the contact resistance of plated contacts in TOPCon solar cells. Further investigations are necessary to characterize the rear side contact recombination of plated contacts in TOPCon solar cells for poly- Si thicknesses below 60 nm. Moreover, further investigations are required to identify the influencing factors to achieve laser-induced periodic surface structures within the laser contact openings on pla - narized surfaces.

In this context, the shading and associated hotpot degradation within PV modules has become an important area of research and development. The experimental approach of this paper aims to investigate single cell shading in high efficiency monocrystalline silicon PV PERC modules. Prior to the outdoor experiment, the PV module underwent experimental testing under STC to determine variation in electrical and thermal behaviour due to partial shading. The indoor experiments are performed using Sun‑simulator and the I–V and P–V curves are analysed. Further, the outdoor experiments were performed under realistic conditions. In both cases, results showed that during 40–60% shading in single cell leads to critical shading scenario causing significant drop in power output in comparison with their unshaded conditions. The maximum power loss of 36.34% and 42% is recorded for indoor and outdoor experiments. The outdoor experiments recorded hotspot temperature of 85–90.1 °C under respective 40% and 60% critical shading scenarios. The efficiency recorded in the time interval of 11:00:00 and 11:30:00 was highest for the solar radiations between 940 and 990 W/m2. The maximum drop in efficiency is recorded from noon till 13:30:00 time of the day. Development of hotspot is directly related to the failure or malfunction of protecting system. Hence the importance of type of PV technology, amount of shading, and critical shading scenario is presented in the study. This study is important for researcher and manufacture to consider single cell shading in PV technology.Keywords Hotspot, Power output, Photovoltaic, Partial shading, EciencyAbbreviationsPV  PhotovoltaicMPP  Maximum power pointFF  Fill factorPERC  Passivated emitter and rear contactSTC  Standard test conditionNOCT  Nominal operating cell temperatureMTC  Module test containerPLG  Pulse light generatorAs stated in a report by Renewables 2022, Global Status Report the solar PV industry outshines by adding 175 Gigawatts of new capacity in 2021, as evidenced in Fig.1. e statistical data are presented by REN 21 which is the only community at global level that provide updates, data, facts, gures, policies related to renewables.

Year 2021 experienced the largest ever yearly capacity increase. e total global solar PV capacity expanded at the fastest rate ever observed, summing up to 942  GW1,2. ree generations of PVs are available in the market including the rst-generation family comprising crystalline si-solar technologies, second-generation is of thin-lm technologies, and the third-generation includes emerging PVs technologies. e upcoming research in the eld of various PV technologies focuses on materials and devices that are extremely ecient, environmentally friendly, economical, operate consistently, and integrate seamlessly. For PV professionals, preventing failures entirely is still the primary objective.In this context, the degradation processes of photovoltaic systems primarily determine their lifetime and reliability. Several studies have indicated that localized overheating, or ""hot spots,"" should receive special attention because it is identied as one of the primary causes of abrupt failures and accelerated aging. One of the primary reasons for hotspots is shading. With this aim, a methodology is developed where the behaviour of a monocrystalline solar module under shading is experimentally analysed under controlled indoor standard testing setup and outdoor climatic conditions.A PV module is a combination of a number of solar cells together having series and parallel connections. A single-diode equivalent circuit is typically used to represent a PV  cell3,4 as demonstrated in Fig.2a. e light-induced current    , the diode dark saturation current  η  , the diode quality factor m, series resistance  Rs  , and shunt resistance  Rsh  are the ve modeling parameters. he above-mentioned modeling parameters get aected by the variation in ambient conditions like irradiation and temperature. Changes in irradiance are reected in the light-induced  current5. Equations1 represents the terminal Current (I) and Voltage (V) equation of the PV cell in terms of the above-mentioned modeling parameters.where  nse  is the number of series-connected cells in the PV module,  VT  is the thermal voltage. e IV characteristic of a whole PV module comes from the IV characteristics of the constituent solar cell.A typical currentvoltage (IV) and powervoltage (PV) curve of the cell, module, or array is shown in Fig.T2b. FigureT2b shows that both the curves IV curve does not have any multiple steps and the PV curve has (1) I =IL−Is    ( V + IR s) mnseVT −1  − V s IR s Rsh Fig. 1.

In case of degradation, these electrical characteristics tend to  change6. Figure2b shows three crucial points on the IV and PV curves: the short circuit point (V = 0, I =  Rs  ), the open circuit point (I = 0, V =  Rsh  ), and the MPP point. An illuminated solar cell delivers a specic voltage at a given current. he operating point of a solar PV system is the combination of current and voltage values. A particular operating point of a solar cell is xed with a load resistance. he short and open circuit conditions associated with a solar cell are dened as the load resistance equal to zero or innitely large, respectively. he current and voltage values at short-circuit and open-circuit conditions are called short-circuit current (    ) and open-circuit voltage (  nse  ), respectively. eere is one specic point where the amps (  VTI  times volts (  =−+  generate the greatest wattage. is point on the IV characteristic curve of an illuminated solar cell is called the maximum power point  () .e additional parameter sets the maximum power generated with the product of Voc and Isc and is called the Fill Factor (FF).e ratio of the useful output power (delivered by the conversion device) to the incident power (of the solar radiation) is called the eciency (  1  ) of a solar cell.S = solar irradiation (W/m2),  η  = module surface area  (m2).e dependability and performance of PV modules may be severely aected by the faults that develop gradu-ally in a PV system in outdoor conditions. e electrical performance of PV modules is constrained by several factors, including the ineciency of the cells, the discontinuity of the solar source, the unpredictable nature of the weather, and inecient working circumstances brought on by electrical  mismatch7. e two variables that inuence IV characteristics are temperature and solar radiation. As solar irradiance uctuates all day long, the IV and PV characteristics vary accordingly. Temperature plays yet another critical factor in dening solar cell eciency. is paper aims to understand how the attributes of the IV and PV curves get aected due to shading, specically in Mono PERC PV modules under STC conditions and outdoor conditions. ereaer, to conclude the potential development of hotspots in PERC monocrystalline PV technologies. A research study presented by authors DC Jordan etηal., presented that hotspot are major concerns over past decade in installed PV system. Single cell shading is very crucial point to consider as it is related with turning ON of protecting during hotspot development in a PV system. However, it is been observed that a vast study is been done either on small wattage solar panel and individual solar cell inside laboratory or the research is been conducted on a commercial large scale PV system. As mentioned in the  report8 with almost 60% market share, PERC design is consolidating its supremacy in commercial eld. Hence it calls attention to research the impact of dynamic environment on thermal and electrical behaviour of commercial designs high eciency PERC PV modules due to single cell shading. e study targets to nds out the critical shading area for a single cell in case of commercial PERC modules that could cause hotspot to develop. e extended part of the research nds out the maximum eciency and duration when the maximum eciency is achieved in several shading percentages. Hence the work provides following key contributions as:1.  Critically analyses of the environmental impacts on high eciency commercial monocrystalline PERC PV Module and analyse the vulnerability of PERC technology towards partial shading and hotspot development.2.  Electrical and thermal responses PV Modules as well as the severity of shading of single cell in high eciency PERC Modules.3.  With the aid of data acquisition systems, the experiments are continuously monitored and the various read-ings of temperature, output power, eciency is recorded during the day.4.  e inuence of type of PV technology, amount of shading, critical shading percentage is presented in the study. is study is important for researcher and manufacture to consider single cell shading in PERC modules. Based on the recorded results a novel technique could be researched in future studies to improve the protecting circuit against hotspot formation.Literature reviewShading and its impact on PV moduleUnderstanding the eciency, reliability, and durability of photovoltaics is very important in perspective with the rapid growth of PV systems. A PV system’s performance is directly aected by shading. Shading can be in any form—complete shadow or partial shadow. e shaded portion of the illuminated PV module acts as load resistance and starts to consume the electrical power. In such conditions, the unshaded parts of the PV module compel the shaded part to go in reverse bias condition. Under reverse bias conditions, the shaded portion dis-sipates power, causing surface temperature to increase and consequently leading to hotspot. A bypass diode is therefore needed to prevent irreversible damage to the shaded solar module. e most frequent causes of shadowing a PV module are vegetation, buildings, the build-up of dust and soil, and animal and bird waste. A shading defect caused by any of these reasons leads to a drop in generated output power.

Figure3 gives a brief demonstration of I–V curves in two dierent scenarios: uniformly illuminated PV module and partially illuminated PV module. e degradation caused by shading is meticulously presented in a research paper by M. C. García etal. e work done in their research demonstrated the diode characteristics under shaded conditions, where a PV cell tends to function in the 3rd quadrant, indicating the power output response of a shaded  module11. Another research work demonstrated that the partial shade hinders the PV performance and damages or degrades the module over  time12. According to Lappalainen etal., the partial shading is primary reasons of mismatch losses observed in a PV system. e sharp shadows create the largest mismatch loss. ese types of shadows are major issues on the roof top as well as residential  installations13.Partial shadows created by moving clouds are of great concern in large-scale PV setups, creating mild irradi-ance variations among adjacent PV modules. Mohammedi A. etal., 2014 presented the complexity and substantial impact of shadowing. eir research work showed that several partially shaded arrays can impact the output more severely than one completely shaded  array14. Another research article conrmed the power loss of up to 10% to 70% due to  shading15.e connection conguration in a module is one of the signicant factors that impact the outputs under shad-ing. However, Vigni etal., 2015 demonstrated that incorporating an extra DC/DC converter and modications in the conguration of the PV system could upscale the array’s energy yield by 30% and power losses by shading can be recovered by 13%16. e authors presented dierent congurations of series–parallel combinations to lessen the eect of partial shading. However, the eect of by-pass diode was not  considered17. e research article by Indu etal. proposed a novel Su Do Ku arrangement, which could eectively reduce the eect of shading in a PV   system18. e bypass diode can prevent a cell voltage from reaching its breakdown voltage while shading. However, Rossi etal. in their experiment concluded that detrimental eects due to shading, such as hotspots, still may appear even if the by-diodes are incorporated into the  module19.A research article proposed a novel topology incorporating BJT with two MOSFETs instead of using a bypass diode to maintain the voltage positive across the shaded cell. is advancement could successfully lower the power loss due to shading. However, the model complexity and overall system cost  increased20. e shading can cause the variation in the temperature at cell and module level. e result of a research study demonstrated temperature surges and decrease in output voltage under various shadow  situations21. Soware-implemented research is also one of the approaches used to analyze PV modules under shading. Several methodologies have been identied in recent research such as articial neural networking to recognize the short circuit types of faults                                ( a )                                                                        ( b ) Fig. 3.

Soware-employed simulation-based models, such as PSpice, PSIM, EMT, and others, are used thoroughly to investigate shadowing eects on photovoltaic  systems24,25. ough quite a large literature is available for partial shading in conventional eld installed modules, addressing partial shading in BIPV is still a new emerging research area. Authors Q. Li etal. presented their remarkable work where a multi-physics mathematical model is presented to foresee the performance of electrical, thermal and structural parameters under three conditions like no-shading, shading and masking and predicts when the hot-spot occurs in BIPV  technology26. Yet a signicant research regard-ing power output prediction in partially shaded BIPV is presented by L. Zhu etal. where the author proposed a thoughtful approach that correlated the solar cell shaded area proportion (%) with photocurrent and series resistor. Based on this analysis, a simplied mathematical model is presented to predict the various parameter under the partial shading conditions. Secondly, they demonstrated relationship between shaded area proportion (%) with I–V and P–V results of PV Module and nally descried the method to maximise the power output of BIPV  Module27. e present literature addresses the issue to partial shading and give us an idea how research in this eld can lead to improvement in performances of dierent PV technologies.Hotspot in photovoltaicGenerating hotspots in PV systems is one of the most challenging conditions. Hotspots can be understood as localized heat sources that may develop in any part of a PV module, leading to an increase in temperature in a particular area. Many reasons are pointed out in the available literature for the development of the hotspot, such as sudden changes in the day-to-night temperature transition. One of the signicant reasons for hotspot development documented in the literature is “shading”28. e appearance of I–V curve provides much informa-tion about hotspot  heating29. Due to their frequency and severity, hotspot has emerged as one of the prevalent modes of degradation in installed PV  systems30. However, some authors used a bypass diode to reduce the hotspot mechanism. e concept of bypass diode was initially proposed in the year 1982 to reduce power loss and hotspot  conditions31.e temperature in hotspot areas may even rise over 100°C, which further leads to other degradations like breakage of glass and browning discoloration, and it may even induce re in severe  cases32. A research article reported that partial shading is more dangerous than full-cell shading. e paper proposed a new approach to identify the shading in a PV module and, hence, knowing the stage where the cell is destroyed permanently due to localized  heating19. In their article, the author showed the numerous ways to recognize the impact of shading and hotspots. ey also demonstrated the impact of non-uniformity of solar radiation using infrared  techniques33. e research study showed that shading ratios from 40 to 60% potentially increased the temperature of the shaded portion from 25 to 105°C,  respectively34. Even the new design technology is facing hotspots due to shading responses. In an experiment, shingled modules showed a greater tendency to build a hotspot than half-cut modules when both modules are exposed to the same shading responses. e hotspot of 145°C temperature was observed in the study, along with the variation in the cell characteristics during   shading35. In addition, the presence of shading creates the chances of generations of hotspots that may cause the development of multiple peaks in the cell characteristics that directly impact the output generations and drop the life expectancy of the PV  module36. With the technology advancement there are many cutting-edge techniques aim to increase the resilience of PV technology in various conditions including shading. In one of the recent research studies, the authors proposed a novel circuit design to mitigate the hotspot in PV Module by employing a dual stage current comparator. rough this technique, the hotspot temperature of 55°C dropped to 35°C and the output power increased by 5.3%37. Another novel circuit for hotspot mitigation is proposed by authors Ghosh etal. where the circuit named as HSMC- Hotspot Mitigation Circuit is capable of reducing elevated cell temperature by 10°C under mismatch conditions by modied bypass  techniques38. Such a technique could be very benecial for large scale PV systems potentially reducing mitigation process. Recent literature presented an article on optimization technique called as a black widow reconguration which proposed to boost power output and better functioning scenario in partial shading conditions. e technique showed better power generation in dynamic and static partial conditions and mismatch losses get minimised with its  implementation39. All these progressions together aim addressing the problem of hotspot and mitigating the development of hotspot.Fundamental details to estimate hotspot temperatureReverse biasing of a solar cell leads to power dissipation that could accelerate ageing and increase failure rates in PV  module40. e hotspot temperature can be estimated as described  below41 through result could be technol-ogy specic as  well42:For m number of PV cells in a string protected by a diode of a PV module operating under S irradiance with  η  be the cell temperature, Voltage be V and Current be  Rs  , a condition of hotspot develops in a cell when its  Rsh  that is short circuit current decreases due any internal and external factors as shown in Eq.s5:Consequently, the hotspot-aected PV cell inclines to work at a negative voltage:where df and ndf in the subscript representation defective (hotspot aected) and non-defected PV cell respec-tively.  nse  is the increase in temperature in the defective (hotspot aected) as compared with healthy cell (non-defective cells). ee  VILs  is directly related to the product of  =−+ .

In this condition, the PV cell works under Solar irradiation  Sirr  and represents solar PV cell in forward biased condition. Hence, power dissipation is negligible, and cell temperature depends only on Solar irradiation, Sirr  .  Ta  is known to be the ambient temperature of the module.Equationa(10) illustrates the shaded PV cell entering hotspot condition (t   tHS  ). Under this condition, two phenomena are noticed: the shaded PV cell is impacted by reduced solar irradiation, Sirr,  and contribution of power dissipation through  Rsh  . he reduction in solar irradiation tends to reduce the temperature with time, while the power dissipation causes an increase in temperature. It has been well observed in the available literature that the power dissipation through  Rsh  is more dominant than primary phenomena causing temperature  THS  , to rise very quickly.Se parameters in the above equation  THS,RTH−HS,CTH−HS,  represents temperature, thermal resistance and thermal capacitance given in [°C], [°C ·  m2/W], [°C ·  m2 · s/W] respectively, of the PV cell of area  ArHS  under (7)  Ths≈CT× IC×V df A (8) C T= NOCT−20 800W/m 2 (9) THS(t)=Ta+RTHcellsirr{t<tHS} (10) T HS(t)=Ta+ArcellRTHcellSirr(t)  +(1−β)e− t−t HS RTHcellCTHcell  +PdissRTH−HS  1−e−t−tHS RTH−HSCTH−HS  {t≥tHS} Fig. 4.  e equivalent thermal model to estimate the temperature of the portion of PV cell  (ArHS  ) under hotspot conditions with time. 7 Scientific Reports |        (2024) 14:21587  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72502-z going hotspot.  ηRs  , [°C ·  m2/W]  R  [°C ·  m2· s/W] represents temperature, thermal resistance and thermal capacitance respectively for the rest of the PV module area not under hotspot. e parameters  nseVeIseVe  depend upon the materials incorporating the top layers of the module cells.ee literature makes it evident that a signicant study has been performed on impacts of partial shading in a PV Module.MethodologyCombining laboratory and outdoor testing is helpful to ensure that PV modules meet their performance require-ments and consistently produce power over their operational lifetime. Dierent PV technologies tested inside a laboratory may behave when installed in outdoor conditions. is study aims to analyse how a commercial PV module behaves when placed in outdoor conditions. Partial or full shading of PV systems is a widespread phenomenon. However, shading could generate non-linearities in electrical characteristics of PV systems. e initial investigation of the PV module is done in the laboratory under STC conditions. Under standard condi-tions, dierent shading percentages are applied to a single PV cell, and the responses of the PV module are recorded. e experiment records the obtained variations in: electrical characteristics, performance parameters, temperature of the shaded cell, and temperature of the entire PV module due to shading.e results of shaded and unshaded are recorded and analysed. A module may behave very dierently when installed in outdoor conditions. Due to variable solar radiation and ambient temperature, the shading may impact the eciency and performance of photovoltaic modules Under elded conditions. Hence, during outdoor test-ing, the impact of shading is analysed under various shading scenarios. Aer that, possibilities for the develop-ment of hotspots are analysed. Along with this, various electrical parameters and electrical characteristics are noted. It should be noted that for some temperature directly depends on concentration of leakage current. e temperature increase is inuenced by the region where the power is  dissipated11. e outdoor experiment will present a thorough impact on thermal and electrical properties due to shaded PV cell. e operation of diode conduction depends on two phenomena—the amount of shading and the shape of the I–V characteristic obtained under a shaded scenario. e measured temperature of the shaded cell through the day is important to attain a corelation between shade-aected PV cells, bypass diode, and increase in temperature. Furthermore, experi-ments performed in the laboratory will provide basic information about the possibility of hotspot occurrence in shaded cells subsequently supported by outdoor testing. e detailed experimental setup is explained below.e experimental approach adopted to determine the corelation between outdoor behaviour and asher val-ues under standard test settings. is involves repeated laboratory and eld measurements under dierent partial shading conditions. is method seeks to examine the connection between the STC warranties and real-world experiences for commercial PERC monocrystalline technology. Terawatt Testing and Research Institute Private Limited, Rajasthan, is renowned organization that provides the accredited solar testing indoor and outdoor laboratory where all the measurement procedure are performed with complete quality management system as per ISO/IEC-17025 standards.e I–V and P–V measurements are recorded during indoor experiments with a steady state G-Sola AAA sun simulator capable of generating variable irradiations from 400 to 1100  = − +  . e simulator is designed as per IEC 60904 guidelines and meets international guidelines. e entire system has 3 units, the module test container (MTC) where the module is placed, pulse light generator (PLG) which generator the pulse for ashes and I–V test operating system. e I–V test system has an operating soware, LabVIEW, to record and present various I–V and P–V curves. An electronic load and professional data acquisition system is also present to trace the graph and record all the experimental results. e simulator makes use of xenon lamps as a source of light generator to stimulate natural sun light for testing purpose to match AM 1.5 spectrum. In the present study, experiment is conducted with xed irradiation of 1000  (1 )   and variable shading percentages on a single cell. e I–V and P–V curves,  η ,  =∗ , F  , = are generated and recorded through the soware system as a procedure of the experiments. During the test, the PV module is exposed to ash test analysis, which will conrm the accuracy as mentioned in the datasheet. Aer that, the PV module is tested with the ash test for dierent partial shading conditions which is explained next section.e outdoor work intends to form a bridge between STC data collected from the laboratory and yield of the partially shaded PV module. ough experiments performed indoor oers a highly controlled setup, the results may dier in the external environments due to varying ambient conditions. To understand the partial shading and hotspot development further, an outdoor experimental study is performed. e module is tested to analyse the electrical and thermal response due to single cell shading. All the variables such as solar irradiation, daily ambient temperature, wind and humidity are recorded continuously and saved with the automatic data loggers available at the outdoor setup. At present this is the best methodology adopted to understand the development of hotspot due cracks, mismatch caused by partial shadings.Indoor experimental setupe location for the experimental setup is the Terawatt Testing And Research Institute (TTRI), Khushkhera, Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, India. e indoor laboratory setup is shown in the Fig.5. e laboratory has a well-designed experimental setup with a Solar simulator Class-AAA, providing variable irradiations ranging from 400 till 1100 W/m2, Data logger with LabVIEW soware that extracts I–V and P–V curves, Temperature gun -Fluke model. e electrical specications of the PV module are given in Table1.

Figure8 shows recorded I–V and P–V curves of the module at standard test conditions. e blue graph shows the current–voltage curve, and the power–voltage curve are shown by red curve.

Figure8 demonstrate the curves to be in perfect shape and no deviations from standard shapes. e recorded values of short circuit current is 9.81 A, open circuit voltage is 48V, and maximum output power is 364.822W. e other performance parameters, which are eciency and ll factor, are available in Table2.Electrical characteristics at standard test conditions with shadingPV modules with shading defects can be easily traced with I–V and P–V curve characterization. Numerous studies have demonstrated the occurrence of multiple steps in I–V characteristics and multiple notches in P–V curves of the shaded PV  modules45,46. Multiple local maxima were found in simulation and experimental studies conducted on a 72 mono-crystalline cells 180W PV. e author found that such a condition is very dangerous and can source permanent  damage47. Even type of distribution of shadow can cause damage to the PV Module. In this context Bayrak etal. 2017 demonstrated the inuence of vertical, horizontal, and cellular shading on the output of PV  modules48. e corelation between shaded area and its inuence on output is presented by Galeano etal. 2018. eir ndings showed that rise in shadow coverage inuences the standard shapes of the I– curve and minimises the maximum output  current49. Similar results were obtained in a study where the results showed the occurrence of multiple peaks in the I–V and P–V curves with cellular and vertical type shading but no variation in the curve with horizontal  shading50. Authors Lyden and Haque presented a methodology to estimate the inu-ence of partial shading for operational PV systems. e results conrmed the visible multiple global maximum power points due to shading under rapidly changing irradiance   conditions51. e authors in their work analysed the impact of shading generated by buildings shading, wire poles shading, plants and birds droppings shading on 20 MWp grid-connected photovoltaic project in northwest China and found similar distractions in electrical  characteristics52. A study analysed the PV system under shaded with using MATLAB/Simpower system soware. e author demonstrated the eect of shape, intensity and distance of shadow on a PV  system53. Figures9 and 10 exemplify the recorded results under dierent shading proles, respectively.Interpretation of electrical characteristics obtained from indoor experimente I–V and P–V curves represents the electrical characteristics of PV module. ese curves have a standard shape under healthy working conditions. Any kind of faults in PV module, distorts I–V and P–V curves from their actual shapes. e graphs in Figs.9 and 10 show visible steps and notches in I–V and P–V curves, respec-tively. According to literature, the results in Figs.9 and 10 are clear indications of mismatch due to shading in the PV  module47,54–57. e maximum power point (MPP) in a PV system, method monitors the instances where the maximum power is produced. Under no-fault conditions, there is just a single maximum point, as demonstrated in Fig.8. While under shading, the PV panel has multiple operating points, which can be seen in this paper as well in Fig.10. Under such conditions, the MMP tracker nds it challenging to distinguish a single GMMP (Global Maximum Power Point) from several local maxima (peaks). Its nature of unique global peak is dened by array conguration and shading pattern.Due to shading in a single PV cell, the short circuit current  η  shows minor drop in its original unshaded values. Hence, the  Rs  of the PV module is aected due to shading. A similar eect on short circuit current is also noted in the conducted experimental test by authors in their research  work58. However, while covering the entire PV cell by implementing 100% shading, the value of  Rsh  drops to its lowest value. hese types of results are also evidently presented in the research article generated  by59. Authors in their study concluded degradation in the    as one main reason for power  degradation60. Signicant changes in  nse  impact the maximum generated power  VILseT  and eVciency (−).Power output of PV module under shading conditionTwo well-known performance indicators of a PV module are maximum power output (  ()1  and e1ciency (−). e experimental study is performed on single cell that represent spot shading. e results show noticeable power losses as the shading factor is increased. As the cell area is 20% shaded, a power loss of 11.6% is recorded. However, further shading 40% of the PV cell causes a rapid drop in power of 30.4%. e large variance is recorded during 40% shading, where the module power ranges from 364.822 to 253.5546 W. Aer shading 60% and 80% shading, the power loss stabilizes to approximately 36.18%. is is probably because, once the shaded cell is forced to function at negative voltages, the power response becomes more sensitive in order to minimize variances in cell reverse characteristics. While shading, signicant changes are observed in  η  , leading to a signicant reduction in    and eciency. e experimental results of dierent shading scenarios are given in Table3.

Shaded cells can act as resistive loads, converting the absorbed sunlight into heat instead of electricity. is localized increase in heat can create  hotspots35,62. At the shading proles of 40% to 60%, the maximum temperature of 30.6°C is recorded in the shaded cell. However, upon further shading, the temperature of the shaded cell starts reducing and reaches 30.3°C. At full coverage, the temperature elevation nearly disappeared. As observed from the experiment, the rise in temperature of the shaded cell has the potential to develop hotspots further when exposed to elded conditions. It is essential to consider that elevated temperatures depend on the leakage current, and power is dissipated in some regions of the cell. During indoor testing, the shaded cell recorded a high temperature of 30.6°C, while the other unshaded cell did not exhibit a signicant increase in temperature. e impact of dierent shading proles is observed by analysing the electrical parameters and curves and elevated temperature recorded by the data acquisition system available at the laboratory.Experimental analysis of outdoor testingApart from power loss, shading can have multiple consequences, and one of the most destructive consequences can be the development of hotspots. e hotspot temperature and its dwell time vary with the respective cells and conditions.Since the temperature of the hotspot is a function of irradiance, it can uctuate during the  day34 Also, the literature states that the amount of power dissipation at the hotspot can vary depending on the defective or mismatched  cell63. During outdoor testing conditions, the PV module is mounted at the outdoor setup for a month and made to work in real conditions to replicate the eld-installed solar modules. Using the arrangements described in Fig.11, each shade prole is tested over one day. e readings are noted down from 08:15:00 to 17:30:00 for every minute with the help of data loggers. e module temperature during unshaded conditions is recorded to be in a range of 55–59°C for the entire day.When cell is stimulated with 20% shading, the temperature rises a maximum value of 70°C. A sharp increase in shaded cell temperature is observed when the shading is increased from 40 to 60%, and the recorded values are 85.5°C and 90.1°C, respectively while the indoor experiments resulted maximum temperature of 30.6°C. However, when the module was operating outdoors, it was anticipated that the shaded cell temperature would rise more under shading  scenarios64,65. Not much variation is noted in the module temperature. During the entire day the temperature of the module under single shaded condition ranged from 59 to 62°C during the entire experimental process and did not very much. However, in the last two shading conditions, 80–100% of a shaded cell temperature drops and is observed in the range of 65–63°C. is occurs due to a sudden drop in photo-generated current. It is very clear from the experiment that the shading percentage from 40 to 60% is a probable partial shading condition when exhibited on a single PV, will cause maximum damage to the PV cell. Under this condition, a hotspot may develop in the shaded cell with an expected hike in temperature. is could be explained as the photocurrent declines due to shading, the cell that is shaded undergoes reverse bias causing dierence in operating points of shaded and other series connected cell. is reverse characteristic of shaded cell is accountable for reverse bias process of the partially shaded cell. For conventional monocrystalline silicon cell avalanche breakdown is one of the crucial mechanism responsible for junction and this occurs at the weakest location in the cell area. e leakage current distribution might not be uniform under reverse bias condition, and one of them could lead to hotspot. Hence it a material property and the distribution of leakage current distribu-tion that would dene the rise of  temperature66. Bressan etal. similar to this paper work explained that partial shading condition is more critical than full shading. To combat this situation they proposed real time shading fault detection that could prevent   hotspotting67. Figure11 represents the maximum temperature and maximum eciency of each shading prole. e maximum temperature of the shaded part in an outdoor setup is dierent  Fig. 11.  Values of maximum eciency and recorded hotspot temperature of the shaded cell for a particular shading percentage. 14 Scientific Reports |        (2024) 14:21587  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72502-z from that in an indoor setting. is dierence is because the ambient temperature and irradiations are constant in indoor setups, while in outdoor setups, the PV module experiences a variable ambient temperature and solar radiation. Hence, the generated output is the combined eect of the persistent environmental conditions.e current owing through the entire string drops when even a single solar cell is shaded. As a result, each PV cell in the string will subsequently operate at the current determined by the shaded cell. e conduction of diode depends on the amount of shading and the I–V curve shape of the shaded cell. e inuence on string, however, is not covered by the present experimental analysis and may be included in future research.Figure11 shows the value of maximum eciency and value of maximum hotspot temperature under particular shading percentage. e temperature of the shaded cell increases till the cell area is shaded 60% of the cell. Beyond that, the temperature of the shaded cell drops. Figure12 clearly compares the recorded eciencies of the PV module for the entire day under respective shading proles. e resultant eciency of the module was obtained with a combined impact of variable solar irradiance and ambient temperature and temperature of the cell. Low irradiance and high ambient temperature lead to lower eciency. In our experiment, the third factor, that is hotspot due to shading, is considered along with the solar irradiation and ambient temperature.As shown in Fig.12, the eciency is low when the sun rises; however, as the solar radiation becomes stronger with time, the eciency increases. However, an increase in ambient temperature along with solar radiation causes module eciency to drop. It is observed that under the hot and dry outdoor conditions, the maximum drop in the eciency during the experiments is recorded mainly around noon till 13:30:30, when solar radiation is not varying much and the average ambient temperature is at its peak. It is observed that when the PV module is not shaded, the module performs well with a maximum eciency (%) of 16.25. e temperature of the cell to be tested for shading is of the same temperature as that of the PV module. e maximum eciency during the 20% shading is generated at 11:30:00 with a solar irradiance of 960 W/m2. Likewise, maximum eciency during 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% shading is attained at 970 W/m2, 990 W/m2, 950 W/m2, and 940 W/m2, respectively. Table4 give the values of the Maximum hotspot temperature, Maximum eciency, maximum ambient tempera-ture, maximum module temperature proles during the days when the respective shading experiment is done.e results recorded from the outdoor experiment under dierent shading proles are synthesized in Table5. e output power also declines when the shading percentage is increased, similarly as reported in the   papers68–70. It can be noticed from the results in Table5, that the generated output current is declining as the shading prole varies progressively from 0 to 100%. e maximum power generation (    ) decreased to critical during the 4060% shading range (  η  = 210.5 Watt and  RsR  201.89 Watt, respectively).

However, in series–parallel connection the hotpot temperature ranged in 64.2°C and 70.7°C71. Authors Ray etal. in their work compared the performance of mono and polycrystalline solar cell. e research covers new geographical locations, a bigger data sets and a unique climatic condition oering new insights to the behaviour of solar cells. eir research work revealed dual axis tracking system oered more energy output than xed orientation system. e methodology and nding meticulously resulted monocrystalline cell performed better in terms of injecting more energy into the grid and pursue higher performance in all the  orientations42. Conversely Benghanem etal. conducted a similar comparative research study in hot and arid region geographical area characterised by very high solar radiation and temperature. e power losses recorded for monocrystalline modules were more than polycrystalline modules in case of high solar radiation greater than 500     72. It is observed in several studies that diode did not conduct during single cell shading that caused shaded cell to act as a load. e temperature of the cell was observed to increase very  quickly71. Similar observations were seen in another recent work that performed fault diagnosis on utility- scale PV  projects73.To authenticate the eectiveness of our experimental process under partial shading condition, the paper presents statistical results of power output, eciency, hotspot temperature. e results presented in this work is in good agreement with the work done by Ghosh etal. and Ahan etal. Similar testing procedure on single cell shading but with dierent array conguration was adopted by authors Ghosh etal. e observed results showed increase in temperature up to 80.7°C in 3 × 1 string under dierent partial shading  condition74. e work pre-sented in this paper is closely parallel to the work done by S.Ahsan etal. where similar testing methodology in conventional crystalline silicon modules. e hotspot temperature of 86.6°C is recorded under partial shading  condition75. It is evident that the results correlates with the nding available in the literature however this paper strictly focusses on single cell shading on new commercial high eciency designs like PERC monocrystalline modules. A consolidate table representing the comparative values of outdoor and indoor experiments are pre-sented in Table6.Conclusionis paper presents a comprehend study on how commercial PERC monocrystalline PV module operated in outdoor climatic condition during single cell shading. e experiments are conducted in the a specically cho-sen commercial monocrystalline PERC PV Module under the North Indian Climatic conditions of Rajasthan. In contrast to laboratory testing, the outdoor conditions are realistic and hence unpredictable. To understand the dierence in the performance the shading experimental work is done in STC conditions under controlled conditions. For indoor setup the maximum power loss is of 36.34%, however for outdoor conditions the power loss of 42% is recorded. e outdoor study denes the critical shading scenario that could lead to temperature rise of about 91.1°C in the shaded cell. Also, it shows that PV parameter show dependency on varying outdoor conditions. It is observed that in commercial PERC module the critical shading scenario ranges from 40 to 60% of the solar cell that causes hotspot development. e eciency of the shaded module peaks from 11:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. thereaer the eciency starts declining due to increase in temperature and solar irradiation having its maximum values. e results present that PERC monocrystalline modules installed in outdoor conditions pose greater challenges because of higher power losses and potential hotspot development due to single cell shading is article is benecial for the researchers, designers, and investors working with solar power systems speci-cally for commercial PERC PV modules to have a critical assessment of PV power systems under shading faults.

The solder stack that complements the Al metallization consists of sputter deposited TiN/Ti/Ag or TiN/NiV/Ag, whereby the TiN layer serves as a diffusion barrier against Al. It is therefore optimized by varying sputter parameters and by stuffing the grain boundaries with oxygen. On the optimized stack a cell-interconnector can be conventionally soldered even after a strong annealing step of 15 min at 425°C, which sets this concept apart from other PVD metallization approaches. Cell efficiency is not influenced by the solder stack compared to a  reference rear metallization by plain evaporated Al. Additionally, long-term stability of the solder-joints on the metallization scheme is investigated by thermal aging of solder-joints and thermal cycling of demo modules with PERC cells.     © 2015 The Authors.

Introduction For the rear metallization of high-efficient, industrial silicon solar cells PVD Al represents a promising alternative to screen-printing. It is favorable regarding optical and electrical properties, it enables reduced material  consumption, including costly silver, and is suitable to contact both n+ and p+ regions on advanced solar cell concepts like BC-BJ structures [1,2]. A major drawback for industrial application and commercialization is the  formation of a native oxide on the Al layer which hinders a conventional solder process and thus a state-of-the-art module integration. If an Al layer is combined with just a solderable top layer like sputtered Ag or NiV/Ag, it is not  Available online at  www.sciencedirect.com © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We are aware that it is crucial to protect the solderable top layer from Al  indiffusion since it is the formation of Al oxide on the Ag surface which prevents solderability after an annealing  step [4]. At the end of solar cell processing an annealing step in forming gas (FGA) is common if it improves passivation quality and/or contact resistance, e.g. for PERC or BC-BJ structures with SiO x  passivation and/or PVD metallization. Depending on the specific cell concept, used annealing conditions vary, but most of these cell concepts benefit most from annealing steps between 2 min at 300°C and 15 min at 425°C. Since Al diffusion is identified as the crucial process that prevents solderability, it has to be suppressed by an additional Al diffusion barrier. Therefore we introduce a sputtered TiN layer as an Al diffusion barrier, and a thin sputtered Ti layer is added to achieve a sufficient adhesion between Ag and TiN layers [5]. Alternatively, the TiN barrier layer is combined with a solderable NiV/Ag capping as in Ref. [6].

The TiN diffusion barrier enables soldering of a standard cell interconnector to the rear metallization with a conventional solder process even after annealing, thus enabling an industrial, state-of-the-art module integration. 2.   Experimental For the deposition of the metallization scheme an ATON 500 industrial prototype PVD machine is used. The Al layer is thermally evaporated in the evaporation chamber and in the same process sequence the solder stack TiN/Ti/Ag is sputtered in the sputter chamber that contains two targets, e.g. a Ti target and an Ag target. They can be used one by one with Ar as working gas. The TiN layer is reactively sputtered from the Ti target with additional  N2  gas in the process atmosphere. Cathode power, tray velocity and Ar and N 2  gas flows can be varied and we can therefore influence the composition of the sputtered TiN layer at a given cathode power by varying the N 2 -to-Ar gas flow ratio. Additionally, ambient air can be let into the sputter chamber through a valve. Infrared (IR) heaters are installed close to the sputter chamber to allow preheating of the samples. The deposition temperature is measured with a Datapaq logger and thermocouples which are conductively glued to the wafers.  To characterize the sputtered TiN layers, we determine their specific electrical resistivity and density. TiN layers are deposited on polished and saw damage-etched Cz Si wafers and the specific resistivity of these TiN layers is measured by sheet resistance measurements with a 4-point-probe. The layer thickness is determined by AFM measurement over a prepared step. By measuring the mass of wafers before and after TiN deposition the density is determined. SEM images are taken to gain insight into the microstructure of the TiN layers.  To investigate the barrier quality of the TiN layer we proceed as described in Ref. [5]. We deposit the PVD metallization scheme with evaporated Al and the sputtered solder stack of 100 nm TiN, 20 nm Ti and 150 nm Ag on saw-damage etched Cz Si wafers which then undergo different annealing steps in forming gas (FGA). If subsequently a soldered cell-interconnector proves sufficient adherence of >1 N/mm in a 90°-peel-test, as required by standard DIN EN 50461, we conclude that Al could not overcome the TiN barrier despite the elevated  temperature during the previous annealing step. If the solder attempt on the metallization fails due to weak wetting  376   Julia Kumm et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  374 – 381  and/or silver leaching or shows insufficient stability in the peel-test, it is concluded that Al has diffused to the Ag top layer and the barrier has failed.  The long-term stability of the solder-joints is tested by thermal ageing. The metallization schemes of stack 1 and stack 2 are deposited on saw-damage etched Cz Si wafers. Subsequently, the samples are annealed in forming gas for 2 min at 300°C and a common cell-interconnector with Cu core and a SnPbAg solder coating is soldered onto the metallization. For the accelerated ageing the soldered samples are then stored on a hotplate at an elevated temperature in N 2  atmosphere and all samples are aged for different amount of times. To investigate the aging duration at which the solder joint degrades at a defined ageing temperature, the interval between the longest time the solder-joint survives and the shortest time after which it fails is determined (and depicted in the result diagram Fig. 2). The degradation time is estimated to be in the middle of this time span. The solder-joint stability is evaluated by a 90°-peel-test, which is passed if the peel force of the solder joints is higher than >1 N/mm. Furthermore, to determine a relationship between solder-joint stability and temperature, e.g. an Arrhenius law, this is repeated with different samples at three temperatures: 130°C, 140°C or 150°C.  Additionally, the developed metallization scheme is applied to solar cells. Therefore n-type PERT (Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally diffused) solar cells are fabricated from 156 mm n-type Cz Si wafers. The cells possess a diffused p+-doped emitter on the front side and an n+-doped back surface field on the rear side. The front side is metallized and contacted by screen-printing and a fast-firing step. The passivation on the rear side is locally opened by laser ablation. Then the rear side is metallized with one of three PVD metallization schemes listed in Table 1 and forming gas annealed to improve the contact resistance. Finally, the cell efficiency is measured.

The front side metallization is conventionally screen-printed, whereas the cells’ rear sides are metallized with three different metallization schemes as listed in Table 2.

The power output of the modules is measured before and after 200 cycles of thermal cycling (TC200) between -40°C and +85°C, according to standard IEC 61215, to evaluate and compare the according power loss. Afterwards  the same modules undergo 1000 h of damp heat testing (DH1000) at 85°C at a relative humidity of 85% and then additionally 10 cycles of humidity freeze testing (HF10) with cycles between -40°C and 85°C at a relative humidity  of 85%, each according to standard IEC 61215.  3.   Barrier optimization  For the PVD metallization concept it is vital that the TiN layer is optimized regarding its barrier quality to prevent Al diffusion even during a typical annealing step. It was reported that TiN is most effective against Al diffusion when it has a dense microstructure and a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1, which coincides with the minimum of the specific resistance [7]. We can influence the composition of the sputtered TiN layer and thus the specific  resistivity by varying the cathode power and the N 2 /Ar gas flow. We obtain the global resistivity minimum of   Julia Kumm et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  374 – 381 377 58 μ �� cm at an N 2 -to-Ar-ratio of 1.40 at 30 kW cathode power under IR heating. Here the TiN layer is stoichiometric and it presents the global maximum within the process parameters of the machine. This TiN layer has a densified, columnar microstructure. In spite of the TiN process optimization, the vertical grain boundaries in the TiN layer offer relatively fast diffusion paths for vertical diffusion processes. This can be prevented by “stuffing” the grain boundaries. When oxygen is brought into the grain boundaries of the TiN layer, it forms Al 2O3  with up-diffusing Al. As Al 2O3  is known to be a very efficient diffusion barrier against Al, this stuffed TiN is a more efficient diffusion barrier than pure TiN [8]. We introduce this concept to the TiN layer in our metallization scheme (see Fig. 1) by interrupting the deposition sequence after sputtering the TiN layer. The samples are unloaded and exposed to atmosphere (‘atmospheric stuffing’) before Ti and Ag layers are added in a second deposition process. To evaluate the barrier quality of the stuffed TiN compared to the optimized, ‘unstuffed’ TiN (without process interruption), barrier structures with both TiN types are annealed under different conditions and subsequently soldered and peel tested. The results are listed in Table 3.  Table 3: Results of solder and peel tests on Al layer with solder stack 1 with 100 nm optimized, unstuffed TiN and 100 nm atmospherically stuffed TiN after different annealing conditions  TiN type 10 min 350°C 10 min 400°C �� 15 min 425°C   Unstuffed TiN ok fail   Atmospherically stuffed TiN ok ok ok  Table 3 shows, that samples with the optimized TiN barrier, deposited at 30 kW and 230°C, can successfully be soldered with sufficient adhesion after a moderate annealing step of 10 min at 350°C (denoted ‘ok’ in Table 3), but fail solder attempt or peel test after annealing for 10 min at 400°C (denoted ‘fail’ in Table 3). In contrast, the stuffed barrier is stable even after annealing for 15 min at 425°C, which confirms a highly improved barrier quality of the stuffed TiN.  Additionally, as annealing conditions of 15 min at 425°C are hardly ever exceeded in a final FGA of cell processing, the barrier quality of the stuffed TiN is considered sufficient for all common cell structures. However, the presented stuffing procedure requires an interruption of the deposition process and breakage of the high vacuum which entails considerable additional process costs in an industrial application. In order to clear this obstacle, an in-situ stuffing process within the PVD machine is developed in the following. 4.   In-situ stuffing  The stuffing procedure is simplified by installing a valve to the sputter chamber. Thus, ambient air can be let into the process chamber to make oxygen available for a stuffing process after TiN deposition in-situ (without vacuum breakage). The barrier results in Table 4 show that the in-situ stuffed barrier is more stable than the unstuffed  version, but significantly less stable than the atmospherically stuffed TiN layer. The reduction of the stuffing effect by in-situ stuffing is not surprising since the diffusion of oxygen into the grain boundaries is driven by Fick’s law and thus the concentration gradient. Table 4: Results of solder and peel tests on Al layer with solder stack 1 with 100 nm thick TiN layers (unstuffed, atmospherically stuffed and in-situ stuffed) after different annealing conditions TiN type 10 min 350°C   1 min 425°C 3 min 425°C �� 15 min 425°C   Unstuffed  ok fail    In-situ stuffed  ok ok fail  In-situ stuffed with IR heaters ok ok ok ok Atmospherically stuffed  ok ok ok ok  378   Julia Kumm et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  374 – 381  The partial pressure or the O2 during in-situ stuffing is reduced by about 5 orders of magnitude compared to atmospheric stuffing. Therefore, instead of extending the time, we accelerate the stuffing procedure by increasing  the sample temperature with the IR heaters to 250-280°C. We find that the barrier quality of in-situ stuffed TiN at elevated temperatures is sufficient to survive an annealing step for 15 min at 425°C, see Table 4. In-situ stuffing  with heating can therefore replace atmospheric stuffing and enables a similarly stable barrier quality that is sufficient  for all common cell structures. Additionally, it is an industrially applicable process. 5.   Long-term stability of solder joints  Long-term stability of solder joints is an important issue regarding industrial application, therefore common cell interconnectors are soldered on the presented atmospherically stuffed and annealed metallization stacks and their  long-term stability is estimated by a thermal aging investigation. We find that the durability of solder-joints on a stuffed Al/TiN/Ti/Ag (stack 1) metallization increases with the Ag layer thickness. Whereas a solder joint on a solder stack with 50 nm Ag starts to fail after about 20 h of thermal ageing at 130°C, solder joints on a stack with 100 nm Ag only start failing after about 100 h. The aging time until a solder-joint fails is observed to rapidly shorten for both Ag layer thicknesses by 1.5 to 2 orders of magnitude when the temperature of the aging process is increased by 20 K. We assume that similar to the procedure described in Ref. [6] the Ag top layer is consumed in an  intermetallic reaction with the solder material whose kinetics can be described by an Arrhenius law as in (1).   TkEBAekTk�Ÿ���Ÿ� /0)(    (1) The thickness of the ‘consumed’ layer  tc  is then given by (2),  tTktc�Ÿ� )(2    (2)   and we assume that the solder-joints fail when  tc  reaches the initial Ag layer thickness of 50 nm or 100 nm Ag respectively. From the peel-test results after ageing at  T  = 130°C, 140°C, 150°C we get values for k(T) which we plot in Fig. 2. The data of the 50 nm Ag stack is linearly fitted through the obtained interval and values for  k0  and the activation energy  EA  are derived.    2,3502,3752,4002,4252,4502,4752,500-5-4-3 -2 -1 ln ( k(T) [nm²/s] )1000/T [K-1 ]  Fig. 2: Arrhenius diagram with linear fit for consumed layer of 50 nm Ag layers on solder stack 1 during thermal ageing.   Julia Kumm et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  374 – 381 379 The activation energies is found to be  E A = -197 kJ/mol. If this result is convoluted with the module temperatures on a German site as in Ref. [6], we obtain a yearly silver consumption of 4.65 nm. Therefore 150 nm Ag in solder stack 1 are expected to be sufficient for a module lifetime of 30 years on a German site. Cell-interconnector that are soldered after annealing on an Al/TiN/NiV/Ag metallization scheme (stack 2) with 50 nm NiV and 15 nm Ag show a strong adhesion even after thermal ageing for 360 h at 130°C and even 150°C. Since a failure of the solder-joints has not yet been observed an Arrhenius law cannot be obtained. However, the high stability after this extensive thermal ageing is considered also very promising regarding long-term stability. 6.   Application to solar cells and module testing  To prove the applicability of the metallization scheme to industrial solar cells, n-type PERT solar cells are fabricated with both solder stacks and with a pure PVD Al reference group, see Table 1. The efficiencies  �D�‰  of all i=1..32 cells are measured and the median efficiencies of the different metallization groups are calculated. All  results are depicted in Fig. 3 in relation to the median efficiency of the Al reference group  �Dm , i.e. the difference  �û�D i =  �D i -  �D�‘  in absolute percent.   Group III  'Ref.'

Additionally, for each group the median efficiency is depicted. The results show that the efficiency of the n-type PERT cells is not influenced by an added solder stack. Fig. 3 shows that there is no significant difference in efficiency between the groups. Therefore, we conclude that an application of the solder stack to cells does not influence cell efficiency.  Additionally, demo modules with each 4 PERC cells with solderable PVD metallization and with screen-printed reference cells (see Table 2) are fabricated. One demo module is exemplarily shown in Fig. 4. Long-term stability of solder-joints on cells with the presented PVD metallization schemes is evaluated on module level by thermal cycling of respective demo modules.   380   Julia Kumm et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  374 – 381    Fig. 4: Photograph of a demo module consisting of 4 156 mm PERC cells with solderable PVD rear metallization.    Fig. 5: Fill factor (left) and power output (right) of modules with cells with solderable PVD rear metallization (see Table 2 for metallization groups) compared to screen-printed rear metallization after 200 cycles of thermal cycling in relation to initial values. All modules show relative losses < 5 % and therefore pass the thermal cycling test. Therefore, the power output at maximum power point (Pmpp) and the fill factor (FF) are measured before and after 200 cycles of thermal cycling (TC200) and the relative changes are compared to those of screen-printed references.  The ratios of the values of Pmpp and FF after TC 200 to the initial values are depicted in Fig. 5. The relative power loss of the reference module might partly be due to light induced degradation, but is however < 3 %, and passes therefore the IEC criterion which allows a relative loss of < 5 %. The relative power loss during TC200 is even < 2 % for all demo modules with PVD metallized PERC cells. The presented solderable metallization therefore shows a  good stability during 200 cycles of thermal cycling, which is a first indication that it enables a long-term stable interconnection. Also after additional damp heat and humidity freeze testing (DH1000 and HF10) the loss of each  demo module with PVD metallization is < 3 %.

Summary and conclusion A conventional, evaporated Al rear metallization layer is combined with a solder stack which comprises a solderable top layer, e.g. an Ag layer, a Ti adhesion layer and a TiN diffusion barrier. Through optimization of the TiN diffusion barrier by process optimization and stuffing of the grain boundaries with oxygen, Al diffusion is prevented even during a strong annealing step. We show that the stuffing procedure can also be executed in-situ within the process chamber of the PVD machine, without interrupting the high vacuum process sequence, if the stuffing process is enhanced by IR heating. Thus, on the optimized stack a cell-interconnector can be conventionally soldered even after a strong annealing step of 15 min at 425°C, which sets this concept apart from other PVD metallization approaches. We show on n-type PERT cells that the cell efficiency is not influenced by the solder stack compared to a reference rear metallization by plain evaporated Al. Additionally, a thermal aging investigation  predicts a long-term stability of the solder connection in a module on a German site for a duration of 30 years if a layer thickness of 150 nm Ag is used. Furthermore, demo modules are fabricated from 4 PERC cells in 156 mm format each, which show to be stable after 200 cycles of thermal cycling.  We therefore present an annealing and long-term stable PVD rear metallization scheme which is suitable for most high-efficient silicon solar cells and is industrially feasible.

The introduction of se - lective emitter (SE) technology becomes imperative to address this issue. In this study, the appropriate range of sheet resistance in the light-doped region (230–280 /sq)and the reasonable interval of the diffusion junction depth in the heavy-doped region (1.2–1.3   m) are presented. The selective emitter with a suitable doping dis - tribution is realized using the mask and etch-back method. Compared to the homogeneous emitter with a sheet resistance of 150 /sq, J 0e  of 16 fA/cm 2 , and J 0metal-front  of 500 fA/cm 2 , the optimum selective emitter results in a J 0e-light doping  of 8 fA/cm 2 , J 0e-heavy doping  of 45 fA/cm 2  and J 0metal-front  of 213 fA/cm 2 . Finally, the boron SE- TOPCon cell samples U OC  (726.5 mV), FF (84.01%), and efficiency (25.51%) are obtained, compared with the TOPCon cell with homogeneous emitter U oc  (717.6 mV), FF (83.77%) and efficiency (25.17%) of the reference. In addition, the efficiency potential of the boron SE-TOPCon cell (26.02%) at the optimal process conditions is determined based on device simulations. This study provides a feasible technical path for mass-produced TOP - Con cells to increase the efficiency to more than 26%.    1.Introduction Efficiency improvement and cost reduction are the two main goals in the photovoltaic manufacturing industry. Passivated emitter and rear (PERC) cells constitute more than 80% of the market share of main - stream photovoltaic products. However, the mass-production efficiency of PERC cells is 23.5–24% [1,2], and there is little room for further improvement. After PERC cells, there are two technical routes, tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) and heterojunction with intrinsic thin-film (HJT) cells, whose theoretical efficiencies are 28.7% and 28.5%, respectively [3–5]. At present, TOPCon has become the primary choice for the next generation of mass-production products owing to its low cost of upgrading equipment and high compatibility with traditional PERC cell production lines [6–8]. Furthermore, the conversion effi - ciency of industrial TOPCon cells is above 25%. The reduction of the emitter dark saturation current density (J 0e ) and the recombination losses under metal contact (J 0metal ) in the emitter is crucial to improving the conversion efficiency of TOPCon cell [9,10]. The introduction and development of a boron selective emitter (SE) can increase the efficiency of a TOPCon cell. Currently, boron doping mainly adopts low-pressure boron diffusion, typically divided into four steps: ①pre-oxidation, ②deposition of boron sources, ③drive-in, and ④post-oxidation [11]. Because of not using the boron SE process, the sheet resistance of TOPCon cells front boron  *Corresponding author. **Corresponding author. ***Corresponding author.

The boron diffusion depth of TOPCon cells without a SE structure typically ranges from 0.7 to 1.2   m, whereas the maximum spike depth of the screen-printed AgAl paste can extend up to 1.8   m [12]. This also suggests that the paste is likely to permeate the PN junction, which results in a high J 0metal  >500 fA/cm 2  [13,14]. Silver-aluminum spikes only begin to significantly affect J 0  within the ""key region"" of 150 nm in the vicinity of the PN junction boundary, which generally corresponds to doping concentrations larger than 1 ×10 18  atom/cm 3 12 (the ""heavy doped depths"" and ""junction depths"" in the study all refer to platform depths >1 ×10 18 ). Therefore the effect of heavy doped depths on the front J 0metal  in boron SE-TOPCon cells is significant. Solutions such as selective laser doping (laser boron SE), the mask and etch-back method, and double boron diffusion can achieve boron SE structure. Among them, laser boron SE is widely used in the industry and is based on the boron diffusion process where additional local doping is performed by laser after the drive-in step; then, a high-temperature post- oxidation is implemented to form a lightly doped zone. The advantage of laser boron SE is the simplicity of the process and the efficiency gains of 0.2–0.3% [15,16]. However, the heavily doped zone formed by laser boron SE has a higher dopant concentration of B atoms. In contrast, the surface concentration of B atoms is only equal to that of the lightly doped zone after the post-oxidation step (>1000  o C, equivalent to step ④ of boron diffusion). Hence, the heavy doping zone cannot be matched to paste with a low aluminum content. This study adopts the mask and etch-back method to achieve the boron SE structure. This method requires only one-time boron diffusion and does not require a laser. Furthermore, the method has cost advan - tages compared to the laser boron SE scheme, can address the low sur - face concentration of the heavy doping zone, and can expand the gap of doping amount between the light and heavy doping zones. However, the heavy doping depth in this scheme and the reasonable window of the light doping with needed sheet resistance need to be clarified. To address these problems, we analyzed the mass production data of a boron SE structure achieved using the mask and etch-back method and proposed an optimization scheme. The appropriate sheet resistance in the light doping zone and the optimum range of the junction depth in the heavy doping zone were determined. Using the optimized boron SE, the batch cell efficiency can achieve a gain of 0.3–0.4%. 2.Experimental details 2.1.Sample fabrication The methodology for preparing experimental samples is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Samples A1-A10 were prepared by modifying the boron diffu - sion process to achieve varying junction depths, in order to examine the impact of junction depth on J 0metal . Samples B1-B6 were fabricated as double-sided boron diffusion samples with diverse sheet resistances in order to examine the correlation between J 0e  and doping level. Fig. 1b illustrates the schematic diagram depicting the structure of the BSE cell sample. Samples C1-C3 were utilized as cell samples shows in Fig. 1b to evaluate the impact of boron diffusion concentration and junction depth on the Fill Factor (FF) performance of the cell. In the experiment, N-type monocrystalline silicon wafers with a resistivity ranging from 1 to 5  cm and dimensions of 182 mm ×182 mm ×0.13 mm were utilized. A mixed solution of KOH and H 2 O 2  was used to clean the wafers, and a pyramidal morphology of a height of ~3   m was then formed on the surface during the texturing process in the KOH solution. Boron diffu - sion was conducted in a low-pressure thermal diffusion furnace using BCl 3  gas. To prepare the samples used for testing minority carrier life - time, BSG was removed by using 30% HF solution for 1 min, followed by 3–5 nm Al 2 O 3  deposition using atomic layer deposition (ALD) equip - ment. A tubular plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) device deposited a 70–100 nm SiNx-SiOx composite film and fired after PECVD deposition to activated surface passivation. To prepare cell samples, the rear side undergoes alkaline etching using an 80  ◦ C KOH solution to achieve a reflectance of over 30%. Subsequently, low- pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and low-pressure phos - phorus diffusion were used to prepare the Poly-Si on oxide (POLO) structure on the rear side. After removing the front polysilicon and surface film layers using HF etching combined with alkali etching, the front side Al 2 O 3  and SiNx-SiOx composite films were prepared. Then 80–90 nm thick SiNx films were deposited on the rear side of the cell samples using PECVD equipment, and the contact was formed using printing sintering of the Ag/Al paste for front-side metallization and Ag paste for rear-side metallization.

X. Li et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1.43   m were prepared, and named as A1-A10, respectively. Then, the double-sided BSG was removed, followed by the double-sided deposition of Al 2 O 3  and the SiNx/SiOx passivation layer. Subsequently, single-side metal contact was conducted, as shown in Fig. 1c. The relationship between PL and J 0  was calculated through the grid-free line zone, and the changes of different metalized zones corresponding to dark saturation cur - rent density (J 0 ) were tested. The linear relationship was fitted to obtain J 0metal  [17,18].  (2) To investigate the influence of the sheet resistance of the light doping zone on implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ), five double- sided boron diffusion samples with different sheet resistances of 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 /sq were prepared, and named as B1-B6, respectively. Then, the double-sided BSG was removed, followed by the double-sided deposition of Al 2 O 3  and the SiN x /SiO x  passivation layer.  (3) Boron SE structure cell samples named C1-C3 were prepared using the mask and etch-back method (employs wax as the masking material, utilizing printing to achieve localized de - posits). After completing the boron diffusion process, the wax layer is applied by printing method to protect the heavily doped area. The buffer oxide etching solution (BOE) with a volume ratio of NH 4 F to HF of 7:1 was used to etch the lightly doped region at 21  ◦ C, ensuring that the thinning was controlled in the range of 0.3–0.8   m, while maintaining the pyramid structure of the wafer surface. The cell structure is shown in Fig. 1b. After texture preparation, the lightly and heavily doped zones of boron diffu - sion were completed. The emitter of C1 adopted the boron diffusion process with a sheet resistance of 130 /sq. In addition, the boron SE structure was applied to C2 and C3. The sheet resistance in the light and heavy doping regions of C2 were 191 and 102 /sq, respectively (the heavily doped region has the same peak concentration as C1, however, different junction depth). The lightly doped region of C3 was similar to that of C2, while its heavily doped region had a sheet resistance of 145 /sq (same junction depth as C1, however, different peak concentration). 2.2.Characterization The current-voltage (open-circuit voltage U oc , short-circuit current density J sc , fill factor FF, and conversion efficiency  ∆ ) parameters were measured using a Halm tester calibrated using a Fraunhofer Institute for solar energy systems (ISE) standard cell. The iV oc  values of the controlled samples were determined using a lifetime tester at an illu - mination of 1 sun (WCT-120 Sinton, Boulder, CO, USA). The samples’ passivated J 0e  and J 0metal  values were measured using the WCT-120 Sinton tester and extracted at an excess carrier density of 3 ×10 15  cm �3  [19,20]. The B-doped profiles of the monitor wafers were measured by the electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) device (WEP CVP21) using a 0.1 M NH 4 F solution as the etchant (The surface factor of the measurement spot was calibrated by employing ECV testing and performing sheet resistive fitting). The specific contact resistivity ( Θ c ) of the screen-printed metalized contact with different profiles was determined by the transfer length method (TLM) (GP-4 TEST) [21]. 2.3.Simulation Quokka (version 2.2.5, manufacturer, location) was used to simulate cell devices. Boron’s SE structure was used on the front side (conven - tional TOPCon structure required the same parameters in the SE region and light-doped zone). The related parameters measured in the mass- production experiment were substituted into the device simulation to confirm the corresponding improvement effect of each processing window. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Determining the appropriate boron diffusion junction depth Boron diffusion samples with different junction depths (A1-A10) were prepared based on process debugging. The doping profile is shown in Fig. 2a, and the junction depths were 0.58, 0.71, 0.80, 0.84, 0.91, 0.94, 0.98, 1.09, 1.21, and 1.43   m for A1-A10, respectively. The J 0metal  data for different junction depths are listed in Table 1. With the increase in junction depth, J 0metal  decreased gradually; how - ever, J 0e  increased gradually, and the total dark saturation current density in the heavily doped region (J 0total-heavy doped ) reached the limit gradually. Λ 0total�heavydoped =Λ 0metal × metalprintwidthsheavilydopedwidths+Λ 0e ×�1� metalprintwidthsheavilydopedwidths�(1) Based on the current industrial mass-production conditions of the TOPCon cell, the simulation calculation is conducted under the condi - tion that the metal printing finger lines and heavily doped finger lines have respective widths of 25 and 100   m (the heavily doped gate area encompasses the metal printing gate area). The J 0total-heavy doped  as a function of junction depth is shown in Fig. 2b. When the junction depth exceeded 1.1   m, the decline of J 0total-heavy doped  began to slow down. At this time, J 0e  was still increasing gradually. When the junction depth of boron diffusion reached ~1.2   m, the J 0total-heavy doped  in the heavily doped zone reached a minimum of ~95 fA/cm 2 . The optimum condition is that the junction depth ranges from 1.2 to 1.3   m. 3.2.Influence of sheet resistance of light doping zone on J 0  The boron diffusion doping profile of the cell with homogeneous emitter is represented by sample B2 in Fig. 3a. Its surface concentration was controlled at ~9 ×10 18 /cm 2 , the junction depth was in the range of 0.75–0.8   m and after the passivation the J 0e  was 16–20 fA/cm 2 , and iV oc  was 705–710 mV. The iV oc  and J 0  results for B1-B6 are shown in Fig. 3b, where iV oc  is the measured result of WCT120, and J 0  is the calculated result (single surface J 0 ). J 0  gradually decreased as a function of sheet resistance; however, the upward trend was not linear. As the sheet resistance increased, its influence on J 0  gradually weakened. The sheet resistance of sample B2 was 150 /sq, representing the recombination level of the boron-diffused emitter on the front of TOPCon solar cells, and the J 0  of sample B2 was 20 fA/cm 2 . The J 0  of sample B3 decreased from 20 to 15 fA/cm 2  as sheet resistance increased from 150 to 200 . The lower J 0  under the passivation layer benefits from a low peak concentration and a shallow junction. The sheet resistance of sample B5 increased to 300 /sq, and J 0  decreased by 2.7 fA/cm 2  compared with sample B3. At this point, the downward trend of the J 0  is no longer significant as the sheet resistance further increases. 3.3.Effect of lateral transmission and contact resistivity on Fill Factor It is known that boron diffusion with high-sheet resistance can effectively reduce the Auger recombination and J 0e . However, consid - ering the increase in the contact and lateral resistances, the fill factor (FF) will decrease as the sheet resistance increases. To study the effect of the doping profile on cell FF, C1~C3 were prepared using the mass production grids (finger width of 25   m and pitch of 1359   m). The diffusion profile is shown in Fig. 4a, and the results are shown in Fig. 4b and c. Fig. 4b and c shows measured heavy doping sheet resistance and contact resistivity, respectively. The sheet resistance of the metal contact zone of C1 and C2 is 130 and 102 /sq, respectively. The sheet  X. Li et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         resistance difference of 28 /sq is due to the different diffusion depths of the two samples. Compared with sample C1, the  Θ c  of sample C2 decreased by 0.41 m cm 2 . The peak concentration difference between sample C1 and C3 resulted in only 15 /sq sheet resistance deviation; however, the effect of  Θ c  was evident, and the difference reached 1.7 m cm 2 . According to the results,  Θ c  can be reduced by increasing the boron diffusion profile’s junction depth and peak concentration. There are similar reports in relevant literature regarding the relationship between  Θ c  and peak concentration [22]. At similar sheet resistance gradients, the difference in peak concentration significantly influences the  Θ c . The electrical properties of C1, C2, and C3 are shown in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4c, the  Θ c  of samples C1 and C2 is close. The main dif - ference is that the sheet resistance of light doping region in sample C2 reaches 200 /sq much higher than that in sample C1 (130 /sq). Analysis of the IV data shows a 0.6% lower FF when sample C2 has a 7 mV U oc  advantage compared with sample C3. This is most likely a loss due to the lateral resistance.

Li et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         From the results of sample C3, FF was reduced by 0.3% based on sample C2, and their lightly doped sheet resistance was the same, which indicates that their lateral resistance loss was consistent. Therefore, the difference between C2 and C3 is due to the difference in  Θ c . Combining the relationship of J 0  and sheet resistance, the sheet resistance of the lightly doped boron SE structure needs to be higher than 200 /sq to decrease J 0 . In contrast, the  Θ c  advantage introduced by the peak con - centration in the heavily doped region cannot compensate for the FF loss caused by the lateral resistance. The decrease in J sc  of C2 and C3 is likely attributable to the softening of the pyramid morphology on the surface of the wafer. This softening, in turn, results in an enhanced surface reflectance during the etching process using BOE solution. 3.4.Cell structure simulations The simulated open-circuit voltage U oc  of the SE structure is shown in Table 3. The result indicates that U oc  of the boron SE structure can be increased by nearly 10 mV at the optimal mass production window. When the parameters of the TOPCon cell with homogeneous emitter whose efficiency reached 25.18% (the standard mass production level) were imported, power loss was calculated as shown in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, when a dense grid (the proportion of metal area on the front of the cell increased from 1.8 to 1.95%) was introduced into the cell with homogeneous emitter, it can be concluded that the increase in FF does not compensate for the loss of J sc  and U oc . The front J 0e  and J 0metal  are the primary factors contributing to the loss of efficiency, and the main purpose of SE technology was to optimize this problem. The lower J 0metal  of the boron SE-TOPCon cell means that it can match denser meshes, and the FF significantly increased, which can effectively compensate for the loss of U oc  and J sc  and achieve improved efficiency. To investigate the influence of the boron SE-TOPCon cell parameters on the efficiency improvement, we take the cell with homogeneous emitter which achieves an efficiency of 25.18% as a baseline, and then we calculate the impact of the different settings as shown in Table 5. By only reducing J 0e  or J 0,metal , leaving other parameters unchanged, the efficiency increases by 0.31% and 0.13%, respectively. In addition, we only increase the sheet resistance of emitter from 150 to 250 /sq, or decrease  Θ c  from 1.3 to 0.8  cm 2 , the change in cell efficiency (�0.12% and 0.05%, respectively) are also listed in Table 5. Based on the analysis of Tables 5 and it can be seen that J 0e  in the light-doped area and J 0metal  in the heavily-doped area crucial to improve the efficiency of the boron SE-TOPCon cell. In contrast, lateral trans - mission and front finger line shading are the deficiencies that impact cell efficiency improvement. 3.5.Realization of process window Different from the preparation of C group, this section of cell group combined with previous experiments to explore the process window and process plan, this study adopted the wax print and etch-back method to achieve the boron SE-TOPCon cell and the superimposed screen pattern optimization to improve the FF defects for cell efficiency verification. Compared with the cell with homogeneous emitter, the efficiency was improved by 0.36%, and the combined SE cell efficiency reached 25.51% (see Table 6). The improvement of cell efficiency was due to the increase of U oc  to 9 mV; this finding is consistent with the calculated results. In addition, FF increased significantly after the SE structure was introduced into the dense gate (part of U oc  gain is given up). The J sc  of the boron SE group was lower than that of BSL, caused by the shading loss in the heavily doped zone. Compared with the tested EQE of cell, the advantage of the blue light response brought by the low concentration of the shallow junction in the light-doped zone can balance this problem; however, introducing a dense gate still leads to the reduction of current. The experimental platform used for this study is the TOPCon half- piece cell mass production line. The finger width used for screen print - ing of mass production line is 25   m, whereas the width of the finger can be 12   m using the plating technology [23,24] Stacking a 12   m finger width on the front of the boron SE-TOPCon cell improves efficiency by 0.3%. Reducing the finger width decreases the front finger shading, and also reduces the fraction of J 0metal  in the J 0total , thus improving the U oc . At this time, the U oc  of the cell has reached 730 mV, and with the decrease of the finger width, the width of the heavily doped region can also be reduced to 50   m, and the U oc  is further increased by 2 mV. Under the condition of the fingers with 12   m width, the grid density was again optimized (2.23% metal region), which increased FF by 0.4%. In this study, the minority carrier lifetime of N-type monocrystalline silicon wafers is shorter than 500   s, which is not the best level in the industry. The bulk life, set as 1 ms, was substituted into the optimized boron SE-TOPCon cell model for simulation calculation. Finally, the 26% efficiency potential of the boron SE-TOPCon cell can be reached under mass production conditions, as shown in Fig. 5. 4.Conclusions This study has demonstrated that the appropriate range of sheet resistance in the light-doped region is 230–280 /sq, and the reasonable interval of diffusion junction depth in the heavy-doped region is 1.2–1.3   m. The boron SE TOPCon cell with suitable doping distribution is realized using the wax print and etch-back method, achieving an effi - ciency increase higher than 0.3%, compared with cell with homoge - neous emitter (whose efficiency is 25.17%). The simulation results show that the change in efficiency by including J 0e , front J 0metal,  and  Θ c  in the boron SE-TOPCon cell structure is 0.31%, 0.13%, and 0.05%, respectively. The high lateral resistance caused by light doping is larger than 200 /sq results in a 0.12% effi - ciency reduction. The main reasons for the power loss of the cell are the front finger shading and lateral resistance. Stacking 12   m finger width on the front of a boron SE-TOPCon cell improves efficiency by 0.3%. Then, the width of the heavily doped region is reduced to 50   m, and the efficiency is again enhanced by 0.07%. In this way, the efficiency of the cell reaches 25.9%. Additionally, the grid density is optimized under conditions of 12   m finger width, and using the existing market silicon wafer with a high minority carrier lifetime (>1 ms), the simulated cell efficiency reaches 26.02%. This study provides the efficiency improve - ment path and scale process route for TOPCon cells.  Table 2 Comparison results of solar cell samples with and without boron SE.

Here we report a combined approach to improving the power conversion eciency of silicon heterojunction solar cells, while at the same time rendering them exible. We use low-damage continuous-plasma chemical vapour deposition to prevent epitaxy, self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth to develop doped contacts, and contact-free laser transfer printing to deposit low-shading grid lines. High-performance cells of various thicknesses  (55130µm) are fabricated, with certied eciencies of 26.06% (57µm), 26.19% (74µm), 26.50% (84µm), 26.56% (106µm) and 26.81% (125µm). The wafer thinning not only lowers the weight andcost, but also facilitatesthecharge migration and separation.It is found thatthe 57-µm exible and thin solarcell shows the highest power-to-weight ratio (1.9Wg−1) and open-circuit voltage (761mV)compared to the thick ones. All of the solar cells characterized have an area of 274.4cm2, and the cell components ensure reliability in potential-induced degradation and light-induced degradation ageingtests. This technological progress provides a practical basis for the commercialization of exible, lightweight, low-cost and highly ecient solar cells, and the ability to bend or roll up crystalline silicon solar cells for travel is anticipated. Crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells have been the mainstay of green and renewable energy3, accounting for 3.6% of global electricity generation and becoming the most cost-effective option for new electricity gen-eration in most of the world4. Although c-Si solar cells now account for more than 95% of the market for solar cells, which usually have a wafer thickness of 150180µm, their use is unfeasible in some extreme appli-cation scenarios, such as satellites, spacecraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, and there is a need for further weight reduction and flexibility of solar cells5. Thus, reducing the thickness of thec-Si wafer to much thinner than that in typical c-Si solar cells, and therebyincorporating the advantages of thin-film solar cells into c-Si solar cells, is the focus of much research1,6,7. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all of the thin c-Si solar cells (55130µm) studied have remained in the range of 23.2724.70% for decades813.Recently, front-back contact silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have become a formidable contender for the next generation of photovoltaic devices owing to their advantages in double-sided power generation, low cost and scalable production, compared to the interdigitated back contact configurations14. To further improve the performance of front-back contact SHJ solar cells on the premise of bendable thicknesses (<130µm), careful research and optimization of each technical step (passivation, doped contact layer growth, metal oxide conductive layer deposition and grid line printing), as well as effectively connecting all of the steps while avoiding unnecessary dam-age to the interfaces, are essential.Highly efficient flexible and thin SHJ solar cellsOn the basis of our research, c-Si solar cells of >26% PCE with thicknesses in the range of 55130µm, possessing features of both high PCE and flexibility, can be produced. Therefore, flexibility must be taken into consideration as an important factor. We divided the c-Si solar cells into categories according to the minimum bending radius of curvature (rb): nonflexible cells (rb>63mm) with thicknesses of >150µm; semiflexible (SF) cells (38mm<rb<63mm) with thicknesses of between 100 and 150µm; and flexible and thin (FT) cells (rb<38mm) with thicknesses of <100µm (thinner than a piece of A4 paper). Thus, we demonstrate the potential of c-Si solar cells to become a category of thin-film solar cells with remarkable flexibility and plasticity (Fig.1a), the cells can undergo various deformations, such as bending and curling. By con-trast, traditional c-Si solar cells (≥150µm) immediately break with a relatively small distortion. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06948-yReceived: 24 October 2022Accepted: 6 December 2023Published online: 31 January 2024  Check for updates 1School of Energy and Power, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China. 2LONGi Central R&D Institute, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd, Xian, Shaanxi, China. 3School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China. 4WA School of Mines: Minerals, Energy and Chemical Engineering (WASM-MECE), Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia. 5These authors contributed equally: Yang Li, Xiaoning Ru, Miao Yang, Yuhe Zheng. ✉e-mail: dfchen@just.edu.cn; jhxu@just.edu.cn; chaoyan@just.edu.cn; lzg@longi.com; xuxixiang@longi.com; zongping.shao@curtin.edu.au 106 | Nature | Vol  |  February  Epitaxy-preventing composite gradient passivationThe first step in resolving the efficiency bottleneck of FT and SF cells is to achieve good passivating contacts. For SHJ solar cells, passiva-tion is typically implemented using intrinsic hydrogenated amor-phous silicon (i:a-Si:H) or hydrogen-rich i:a-Si:H passivation layers in conventional techniques15–18, but epitaxial dendrite growth from the c-Si surface is inevitable (Extended Data Fig.1a,b). Although oxy-gen doping is considered to be beneficial in suppressing epitaxial growth, it is associated with a decrease in the electrical properties of the passivating contacts19. In this work, a two-stage composite gra-dient passivation process was adopted to resolve this contradiction (Fig.1b). In the first stage, 2–3 atomic layers of an oxygen-containing amorphous silicon subnanolayer (<0.5nm; i:a-SiOx:H(1) x10at%) were bifacially grown on c-Si by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). The ultrathin passivation layer i:a-SiOx:H(1) prevents the periodicity of the crystal arrangement of c-Si from con-tinuing outwards, while minimizing the impact of oxygen doping on the electrical properties of the passivation contacts. In the second stage, an epitaxy-free i:a-Si:H(2) passivation layer with a thickness of about 4.5nm was intentionally coated on i:a-SiOx:H(1) to strengthen the passivation effect and isolate the subsequent doping layers. The enlarged cross-sectional morphology in Extended Data Fig.1c high-lights the various regions of the composite gradient passivation lay-ers and demonstrates that the ultrathin oxygen-doped subnanolayer fundamentally prevented the formation of epitaxial silicon nanotwins. Compared with the traditional hydrogen-rich i:a-Si:H/a-Si:H, the i:a-SiOx:H(1)/a-Si:H(2) composite passivation layers increased the PCE by  0.34% (Fig.2a).Low-damage continuous-plasma CVD operationWe realized that the conventional discontinuous-plasma CVD process is not ideal, as the subnanolayer is vulnerable and highly sensitive to the plasma fluctuation and reignition (transient high-voltage surges). After being subjected to the stepwise PECVD procedure, i:a-SiOx:H(1) was found to have perforating defects distributed on its surface, and the peak roughness was 0.5nm (Fig.2b). These devastating vacancies can serve as a new foundation for c-Si epitaxial growth, impairing the passivation function of i:a-SiOx:H(1). Hence, we adjusted the commonly used step-by-step procedure to a one-step continuous-plasma CVD passivation process, so that i:a-Si:H (2) can be continuously grown on i:a-SiOx:H(1) while guaranteeing the integrity of the epitaxy-preventing i:a-SiOx:H(1) subnanolayer (Fig.2c) and the optimal passivation effect can be obtained. Notably, the continuous process produced a naturally evolving rather than abrupt interface between the i:a-SiOx:H(1)/a-Si:H (2) composite passivation layers (Extended Data Fig.1c), because of the gradual transition of the feed gases. The hydrogen content (CH) and microstructure factor (R*) are two key parameters influencing the pas-sivation quality, which need to be individualized in i:a-SiOx:H(1) and i:a-Si:H(2) owing to their differentiated functions. High CH is required for i:a-SiOx:H(1) to saturate dangling bonds, whereas tailoring CH for i:a-Si:H(2) focuses more on boosting the output. As a result, we can see from Fig.2d that the effective minority carrier lifetime (eff) climbed to  FT 84-τm cell abi:a-SiOx:H (1)x  10 at%subnanometreEpitaxial Si(nanotwins ) EpitaxypreventionLowdamagei:a-Si:H (2)Verticalgrowthnc-Si:H/nc-SiOx:Hi:a-Si:Hpassivationa-Si:H/a-SiOx:HCrystallineSi atomsEpitaxialSi atomsPassivatorSi atomsPassivatorO atomsH atomsPassivatorSi atomsn+/p+junctionnanocrystalline Si atomsn+/p+ junctionamorphous Si atomsn+/p+ junction O atomsSelf-restoringnanocrystallinesowingThinning n:c-Si (56125 ��m) i:a-Si:H (2) (4.5 nm)n+:nc-SiOx:H (15 nm)ICO (70 nm)p+:nc-Si:H (22 nm)ICO (70 nm) Ag Agi:a-Si:H (2) (4.5 nm) i:a-SiOx:H (1) (<0.5 nm) i:a-SiOx:H (1) (<0.5 nm) Gradualtransition Non-ideal passivation FT 57-τm cell Fig. 1 | Schematic diagrams of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells. a, Structure schematics and photographs of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells(166×166 mm).  b, Schematic diagrams of the continuous-plasma CVD composite gradient passivation, the nanocrystalline sowing and the vertical growth induction steps.

In terms of cell performance, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE all experienced the greatest gains under the optimal passivation conditions (Extended Data Fig.2). By contrast, under the same conditions, eff was reduced to 4.4ms through the discontinuous-plasma CVD passivation operation (Fig.2e), indicating degradation of the passivation effect and cell performance. On the basis of the above optimization, the cell performance is clearly com-prehensively improved through protective continuous-plasma CVD, and the average values of PCE, FF, VOC and the short-circuit current (JSC) can be further increased by 0.30%, 0.42%, 1.0mV and 0.22mAcm2, respec-tively, compared with those of the discrete PECVD process (Fig.2f–i).Nanocrystalline sowing and contactvertical growthThen n- and p-type carrier-selective contacts were grown by very high-frequency (VHF)-PECVD on the passivation layers, playing the roles of the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. According to the schematic in Fig.2j, in traditional nanocrystallization routes, the nanocrystals are randomly dispersed in the contact layers and not coherent in the longitudinal direction, clearly visible in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Extended Data Fig.3a, which impedes the carrier sep-aration and extraction efficiency20–23. Instead, we used a self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing technique to induce vertical growth of doping junctions on both sides, as depicted in Fig.1b, further reducing the electrical resistive loss and parasitic absorption loss in the direction of current flow (Fig.2k). We discovered that using VHF CO2 plasma to treat the i:a-Si:H(2) surface can dehydrogenate it and encourage a transfor-mation of the original amorphous state (Fig.2l) to a partially nanocrys-tallized (nc-)state, and the nanoscale crystalline seeds can be observed after the prerequisite incubation (Fig.2m). However, the trade-off is that the crystallization process is unrestricted, causing unwanted CH loss in the bulk passivation layers as a function sowing duration (Extended Data Fig.4c,d), and the cross-sectional HRTEM image (Extended Data Fig.4e) testifies that if not controlled, reverse epitaxy would occur,  0102030405060701.21.41.61.82.02.2 Crystallinity fraction [%] 01020304050607025.826.026.226.426.6 Crystallinity fraction [%] 051015202530710720730740750760770 Thickness (nm) 051015202530710720730740750760770 Thickness (nm) 57 m 84 m 125 m 01020304050607025.425.625.826.0Crystallinity fraction [%] 3.184.004.524.754.975.014.94 4.054.815.014.884.784.734.70 1015202530345��eff (ms)Hydrogen content (%) 1015202530345 0102030405060702.02.22.42.62.83.0Crystallinity fraction [%] 10–510–310–1101103Conductivity (S cm–1)  1 × 10141× 10151× 1016246810Excess carrier concentration (cm–3)  39.59 39.81 39.439.639.840.0JSC (mA cm–2) 84.73 85.15 84.684.885.085.285.4FF (%) 747.0 748.0 746747748749VOC(mV) 25.06 25.36 25.025.225.4DiscontinuousplasmaContinuousplasma 24.71 25.05 24.624.825.025.2 PCE (%) 00.20.40.60.81.01.2–0.400.4 00.20.40.60.81.0–0.400.4 aeg hf d i c b Length (m)Height(nm)lnpRandom growthkoqrs After self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing m TCOTCO T T Before self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing e– e– e–e– e– e–e– e– e–e– e–ShallowsurfaceNanoseedprelaid e–e–e–e–e– e– h+HR i:a-Si:H/a-Si:Hi:a-SiOx:H (1)/a-Si:H (2)jSelf-restoring NSVGI Length (m)Height(nm)i:a-SiOx:H (1)PCE (%)DiscontinuousplasmaContinuousplasmaDiscontinuousplasmaContinuousplasmaDiscontinuousplasmaContinuousplasmaHydrogen content (%)i:a-Si:H (2)�Weff (ms)Discontinuous plasmaContinuous plasma�Weff (ms)VOC(mV)VOC(mV) 57 m 84 m 125 mPCE (%)PCE (%) Bandgap (eV) Random growth Self-restoring NSVGI Random growth Self-restoring NSVGI Bandgap (eV)10–510–310–1101103Conductivity (S cm–1)  i:a-Si:H (2)i:a-Si:H (2) Random growth Self-restoring NSVGI Fig. 2 | Passivation and nanocrystalline contacts. a, Gain effect of i:a-SiOx:H(1)/a-Si:H(2) on the cell performance (HR, hydrogen rich). b,c, Atomic force micrographs (top) and the corresponding surface profiles (bottom) of i:a-SiOx:H(1) after the discontinuous-plasma (b) and continuous-plasma  (c) CVD processes.

As a result, we implemented a new self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing technology by introducing an effectively coordinated two-component VHF plasma of H2 and CO2. The hydrogen atoms in the bifunctional plasma can spontaneously diffuse inside to restore CH (Extended Data Fig.4c,d) while restricting the nanocrystalline sowing on the shallow surface of i:a-Si:H(2). Subsequently, the doped contact layers ger-minated and grew upwards from the prelaid nanoseeds, opening up ‘photogenerated carrier superhighways’ between the upper and lower layers, and the corresponding cross-sectional HRTEM image is shown in Extended Data Fig.3b. Ultimately, with the assistance of the self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth induction process, the carrier conductivities of the contact layers exponentially increased with the crystallinity fraction (XC), from 105Scm1 in the state with a low nanocrystalline fraction to >102Scm1 in the state with a high nanocrystalline fraction (Fig.2n,o), approximately 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those in traditional nanocrystallization routes. However, there is a trade-off for the selection of the XC values. For the front n+:nc-SiOx:H window layer, the increasing XC hampers the formation of strong Si–O bonds (8.4eV), narrowing the bandgap (Fig.2n) and limiting the incident light transmittance. Therefore, the XC of n+:nc-SiOx:H was optimized to 43.7% when the PCE was taken into account (Fig.2p), and the FF showed a similar trend with XC (Extended Data Fig.4a). By contrast, the rear junction (p+:nc-Si:H) can withstand a higher crystallinity to facilitate the hole transport because the impact of incident light does not need to be accounted for. Nevertheless, a high XC hinders the boron-dopant subbands from incorporating the intrinsic band structure, which causes a rapid increase in the bandgap of the HTL and increases the transparency for the longwave transmission (Fig.2o). Simultaneously, the moderate XC is advantageous for shortening the growth duration and maintaining the crystal coherence. Therefore, the cell performance peaked at a rear emitter crystallinity of 63.4% (Fig.2q and Extended Data Fig.4b). By comparison, the effects of the traditional nanocrystalline routes were much less, as shown in grey in Fig.2p,q. In addition, the ETL and HTL layers require certain thick-nesses to generate sufficient depletion regions for carrier separation, but excess thicknesses can result in same-polarity repelling and carrier recombination. As the window layer, the n+:nc-SiOx:H ETL needs to be thinner to allow the maximum number of photons to be incident into the active layer. Therefore, after compromising the above three conditions, the thicknesses of the n+:nc-SiOx:H ETL and the p+:nc-Si:H HTL were optimized to 15nm and 22nm, respectively, at which the VOC curves reached the maxima, indicating the optimal electron and hole separation effect (Fig.2r,s).Ce-doped indium oxide and laser transfer printingThe passivating contacts are nondegenerate semiconductors exhib-iting low lateral conductivity, so highly degenerate transparent con-ducting oxide (TCO) layers are stacked on silicon contacts to assist in collecting carriers to electrodes. Cerium-doped indium oxide (ICO) has been attracting increasing interest for solar cell applications owing to its excellent mobility and transparency24,25. In a typical sputtering process for TCO layer deposition, the plasma ions directly bombard the sample surface, resulting in degradation of the cell performance.  50607080901001101201300.81.01.21.41.61.82.0 2030405060 506070809010011012013026.026.527.0 PCE (%) 506070809010011012013040.040.541.041.5 JSC (mA cm2) 5060708090100110120130750755760765 VOC (mV) 506070809010011012013085.085.586.086.5 FF (%)Thickness (m)12108642000.20.40.60.81086420Thickness (��m)PWR (W g–1)Radius of curvature (mm) ISC = (11.013 ± 0.12) AVOC = (0.7613 ± 0.0032) VFF = (85.13 ± 0.94)%Pmpp = (7.137 ± 0.11) W�K = (26.06 ± 0.39)% ea dcgf95% condence intervalMaximum residual error: 0.11 % 12108642000.20.40.60.8Voltage V (V) 1086420Power P (W) Current I (A) 12108642000.20.40.60.8108642012108642000.20.40.60.810864207.512.510.05.02.5000.20.40.60.810.08.06.04.02.00Acell = (273.8 ± 1.1) cm2Thickness: 57 mCalmark: 002981 b Thickness (m)Thickness (m)Thickness (m)95% condence intervalMaximum residual error: 0.8 mV 95% condence intervalMaximum residual error: 0.08 mA cm–2 Current I (A) Power P (W) Current I (A) Power P (W) Voltage V (V) Voltage V (V) Power P (W) Current I (A) Current I (A) ISC = (11.234 ± 0.12) AVOC = (0.7529 ± 0.0032) VFF = (86.08 ± 0.95)%Pmpp = (7.280 ± 0.11) W�K = (26.56 ± 0.40)%Acell = (274.1 ± 1.1) cm2Thickness: 106 mCalmark: 00297595% condence intervalMaximum residual error: 0.07% ISC = (11.085 ± 0.12) AVOC = (0.7577 ± 0.0032) VFF = (85.42 ± 0.94)%Pmpp = (7.174 ± 0.11) W�K = (26.19 ± 0.39)%Acell = (273.9 ± 1.1) cm2Thickness: 74 mCalmark: 002977ISC = (11.158 ± 0.12) AVOC = (0.7558 ± 0.0032) VFF = (86.11 ± 0.95)%Pmpp = (7.262 ± 0.11) W�K = (26.50 ± 0.40)%Acell = (274.0 ± 1.1) cm2Thickness: 84 mCalmark: 002979ISC = (11.375 ± 0.13) AVOC = (0.7514 ± 0.0032) VFF = (86.07 ± 0.95)%Pmpp = (7.356 ± 0.11) W�K = (26.81 ± 0.40)%Acell = (274.4 ± 1.1) cm2Thickness: 125 mCalmark: 002896 Voltage V (V) Voltage V (V)  Power P (W)  1.90 ± 0.04Best PWR 1.47 ± 0.04 1.47 ± 0.04 1.47 ± 0.041.31 ± 0.03 1.31 ± 0.03 1.31 ± 0.031.04 ± 0.03 1.04 ± 0.03 1.04 ± 0.030.89 ± 0.03 0.89 ± 0.03 0.89 ± 0.0319.6 ± 0.5 19.6 ± 0.5 19.6 ± 0.527.6 ± 0.5 27.6 ± 0.5 27.6 ± 0.531.0 ± 0.5 31.0 ± 0.5 31.0 ± 0.538.5 ± 0.5 38.5 ± 0.5 38.5 ± 0.544.9 ± 0.5 44.9 ± 0.5 44.9 ± 0.5Fig. 3 | Parameter statistics and certification reports. a, Statistical parameters of 100 cells with various thicknesses. b–f, Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin-certified current–voltage (I–V) and power–voltage (P–V) curves of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells with thicknesses of 57µm (b), 74µm (c), 84µm (d), 106µm (e) and 125µm (f). mpp, maximum power point. g, PWR data and flexibility of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells.

Nature | Vol  |  February  | 109In this work, we deposited ICO as the TCO coating by the low-damage reactive plasma deposition method, which produced superior electri-cal performance, including much lower resistivity (2.7×104cm) and higher carrier mobility (83.1cmV1s1), when compared to those of the magnetron sputtering-derived indium tin oxide (Extended Data Table1b) and other TCOs reported elsewhere26. The TCO innovation not only contributed a 0.1% reduction in the total electrical power loss, but also played a decisive role in subsequent stability improvement. Afterwards, we strived to reduce optical loss by optimizing the con-figuration of grid lines using industry-compatible contact-free laser transfer printing (LTP) technology27. The finger width could be reduced from 40µm (typical screen printing) to 18µm, with the shading area controlled to less than 2%. Extended Data Fig.5 verifies that LTP makes a great contribution to JSC and the PCE, increasing them by 0.33mAcm2 and 0.22%, respectively.Cell performance and certificationSince Sanyo suggested wafer thinning as a strategy to maximize eco-nomic benefits, researchers have been exploring ways to improve the performance of thin-wafer c-Si solar cells12; however, it remains a great challenge to break through the 26% barrier for SF, and espe-cially FT, solar cells8,13,28. Through investigation of the above mecha-nism and technical innovation, we were able to achieve efficiencies above 26% in the full range of 55–130µm, as shown in Fig.3a, and certified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin. The certificates for the cells with thicknesses of 57µm (26.06%), 74µm (26.19%), 84µm (26.50%), 106µm (26.56%) and 125µm (26.81%) are presented in Fig.3b–f, respectively (to our knowledge, the highest values so far for each thickness), whereas the control group without the above improvement steps could achieve conversion efficiencies only in the range 24.28–24.72% (Extended Data Table1c). Remarkably, the SF cell (125µm) obtained the highest c-Si solar cell efficiency, and to our knowledge, the FT cell (57µm) achieved the highest VOC of any c-Si solar cell, 761mV. The importance of this work is also reflected in the power-to-weight ratios (PWRs) for each thickness (Fig.3g). The PWR of the FT cell (57µm) reached 1.9Wg1, which, to our knowledge, is the state-of-the-art for c-Si solar cells and more than twice that of the 125-µm SF cell (0.89Wg1). Meanwhile, the flexibility brought about by thinning was also substantially improved, allowing the cell radius of curvature to be 19.6mm. This opens up new possibilities for drones, spacecraft and other applications that require extreme weight and flexibility. The advantages of this work can also be seen in a horizontal comparison with other types of solar cell. Extended Data Table1d lists some representatives of different types of high-performance solar cell. Other current records are those set by Kaneka’s interdigitated back contact-structured solar cells (26.7%)29,30, Jinko’s tunnel oxide passivated contact solar cells (26.1–26.4%)31–33 and LONGi and Trina’s passivated emitter and rear contact solar cells (24.06–24.5%)34,35.External quantum efficiency and stabilitytestThe cell thinning brings two benefits, as evidenced in the absolute efficiency loss model using the theoretical limit (29.1%) as a benchmark (Fig.4a). First, the resistance of the silicon matrix is reduced, lowering the resistive loss from 0.37% (125µm) to 0.31% (57µm). Second, the migration distance of the photogenerated carriers is reduced, lowering the recombination probability, and the extrinsic recombination loss decreases from 0.49% (125µm) to 0.46% (57µm). As a consequence, from Fig.4b we can see that the external quantum efficiency increased with the cell thinning in the ultraviolet-to-visible (UV–Vis) region, on the basis of the shallow absorption depth (<10µm) of the UV–Vis photons. However, the absorption depths of near-infrared (NIR) light exceed the cell thicknesses (for example, 102–106µm at 1,000–1,200nm), so the external quantum efficiency in the NIR range decreased as cell thinning progressed, increasing the optical loss from 1.44% (125µm) to 2.27% (57µm), which is the main cause of the JSC drop with cell thinning. As shown in Fig.4c, the NIR loss of the FT cell (57µm) was 0.35mAcm2 higher than that of the SF cell (125µm), whereas the thinnest FT cell had the lowest blue (UV–Vis) loss, which was 0.22mAcm2 lower than  26.527.0 26.527.027.5 05010015020024.525.025.5 26.5026.3826.3426.3126.30 26.8126.7126.6426.6226.61 24.7524.6524.5824.5524.53PCE (%) Time (h) 26.527.0 26.527.027.5 05010015020024.525.025.5 26.5026.3826.4026.40 26.8126.7326.6926.71 24.7524.6224.6024.58 Accumulated irradiation (kWh) 0.590.720.770.800.812.422.482.252.192.07 57748410 61 2500.51.01.52.02.5Optical loss (mA cm2)Thickness (m)  Blue loss  NIR loss 0.130.200.130.150.050.800.810.810.820.83 57748410612500.20.40.60.81.0 BC loss SD loss 1.351.081.070.970.801.200.960.970.810.73 57748410612500.51.01.5 3004005006007008009001,0001,1001,200020406080100 EQE (%)Wavelength (nm)Integrated J (mA cm–2) 01020304050 26.8126.5626.526.1926.060.370.350.340.320.310.490.480.480.470.461.441.711.782.122.27 2526272829 ba d57 ��m74 ��m84 ��m106 ��m125 ��mAbsolute efciency loss from theoretical limit (%) Conversion efciencyResistive lossExtrinsic recombination lossOptical loss c efTraditional SHJ 150 ��m gSF 125 ��m (26.81%) FT 84 ��m (26.50%) FT 57 ��m (26.06%)  Optical loss (mA cm–2)Optical loss (mA cm–2) Thickness (m)Thickness (m) FSE lossARC loss SF 125 ��mFT 84 ��mTraditional SHJ 150 ��mSF 125 ��mFT 84 ��mPCE (%)PCE (%)PCE (%)PCE (%)PCE (%)Fig. 4 | Quantum efficiencies, loss elements and stabilities. a, Summary of loss elements for the FT and SF SHJ solar cells relative to the practical limit (29.1%). b, External quantum efficiency (EQE) of the FT (57 and 84µm) and SF (125 µm) solar cells. c, NIR and blue optical losses of the FT and SF solar cells.  d, Shading (SD) and base collection (BC) losses of the FT and SF solar cells.  e, Antireflection coating (ARC) and front surface escape (FSE) losses of the FT and SF solar cells. f, Certificated PID ageing tests. g, Certificated light-induced degradation ageing tests.

Furthermore, owing to the advanced LTP process, the shading loss was reduced to 1.7%. In addition, the base collection loss, antireflection coating loss and front surface escape loss for the 57-µm cell were also well controlled, accounting for 0.28%, 2.6% and 2.9% respectively, as shown in Fig.4d,e.To comprehensively study the cell performance, we systematically investigated the stabilities of the FT and SF SHJ solar cells according to International Electrotechnical Commission 61215:2021 (ref.36). After 96h of potential-induced degradation (PID) ageing test(Extended Data Fig.6), the power attenuation of the FT and SF cells was about 0.6% (Fig.4f), much lower than the threshold value (5%). At the same time, we also found that the anti-PID capacities of the FT and SF cells exceeded those of the conventional SHJ cells because the reactive plasma deposition-derived ICO layer exhibited electrical properties superior to those of the conventional indium tin oxide layer, as dem-onstrated in Extended Data Table1d and Extended Data Fig.7a,b. Addi-tionally, in the process of light-induced degradation ageingtests, the attenuation should not be higher than 1% after an accumulated illumina-tion of 20kWhm2. As shown in Fig.4g, the practical power attenuation of the FT and SF cells was still <0.4% after irradiation of 210kWhm2, which was lower than that of the conventional SHJ cells (0.67%) owing to the strengthened i:a-SiOx:H(1)/a-Si:H(2) composite passivation lay-ers and nanocrystalline n+:nc-SiOx:H and p+:nc-Si:H contacts (Extended Data Fig.7c,d). The results presented above demonstrate that the FT and SF cells are environmentally adaptable and durable. In addition, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: light-induced degradation followed by a degree of PCE recovery, primarily due to the rebound of VOC and FF, whereas JSC remained relatively stable (Extended Data Fig.8). The underlying causal mechanisms of the light-induced degradation are extremely complicated, and further research and in-depth study are needed. Nevertheless, according to our current research, strengthening the passivation layers and decreasing the overall amorphous degree are effective ways to reduce the impact of light-induced degradation. Another advantage of our structures is the lower cost of the raw mate-rial. According to recent SHJ solar cell cost models, every 10µm of thin-ning brought about by the FT and SF cells can reduce silicon usage by about 7% and save about 3% in overall manufacturing cost2,37–39.Online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa-ries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl-edgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06948-y.1.

The wafers were in (100) orientation with a resistivity of 1–3cm. The thin-ning process was conducted by immersing the wafers in 10% KOH-based solution for isotropic chemical etching. The etching duration was care-fully controlled from 180 to 1,500s to obtain the target wafer thick-nesses. Subsequently, the wafers were textured in KOH solution mixed with additives. Pyramids featuring (111)-orientated facets and 3–9µm in size were formed on both sides after texturing, followed by chemical removal with a 1–2% diluted hydrofluoric acid solution for stripping off native SiOx films on the wafer surface. The average thickness of each set of wafers was determined by weight measurement with an accuracy of ±0.5µm.Surface passivationThe feed gases of silane (SiH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with a flow ratio of [CO2]/[SiH4]=0.15:1 were induced by the RFPECVD (13.56MHz) sys-tem at 190°C to grow 2–3 atomic and epitaxy-preventing i:a-SiOx:H(1) subnanolayers (<0.5nm) on both sides. To avoid unwanted plasma damage during the implementation of subsequent passivation lay-ers, we installed a self-developed continuous regulation and control system (CRCS) in the CVD equipment; >5,000 diodes were integrated in CRCSas the feedback terminal for real-time monitoring of plasma bombardment intensity, particularly surface voltage, on the wholecell surface(166×166mm), cooperating with the fine adjustment from the intelligent control system in CRCS to balance the system resistance and avoid plasma fluctuations. Therefore, we found that not only can the plasma be kept uninterrupted during the feed gas switching process, but also the plasma fluctuations can be controlled at a low level during the entire passivation process, especially important in transitional peri-ods. Then, the CO2 supply was programmatically switched to hydrogen (H2) until a flow ratio of [H2]/[SiH4]=19:1; Extended Data Fig.9a veri-fies that the plasma fluctuation was controlled<±0.5% under precise CRCS adjustment. Subsequently, another approximately 4.5-nm-thick epitaxy-free i:a-Si:H(2) layer was coated onto the i:a-SiOx:H(1) subna-nolayers bifacially. The continuous-plasma CVD process produces a natural interface transition from the first passivation layer to the second passivation layer, and the entire passivation process protects the delicate amorphous layers from plasma damage.By contrast, conventional passivation relies on the step-by-step PECVD processes for depositing multiple layers, which are susceptible to contamination and defects (bombardment damage). For comparison with the continuous-plasma CVD process, we prepared the control group as follows. The i:a-SiOx:H(1) layers were grown in the same way as above; however, we found that without the rapid-response regulation of CRCS, the plasma fluctuation in the conventional CVD process was about 8% (Extended Data Fig.9b), inferring that the uniformity of the resulting passivation layers is inferior to that of those produced through the continuous-plasma CVD process. More seriously, in conventional CVD passivation, switching between different feed gases causes a sud-den change of system resistance, rendering the plasma unsustainable and the RF power to cease after depositing the i:a-SiOx:H(1) subnanolay-ers. Until the feed gases were switched to the predetermined proportion of [H2]/[SiH4]=19:1, RF plasma was reignited along with high-voltage pulses (Extended Data Fig.9c) and the power was rematched to deposit the subsequent i:a-Si:H(2) passivation layer.Doped contacts, TCO and grid linesThe doped contact layers were fabricated through self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth induction. The i:a-Si:H(2) surfaces were intentionally pretreated with a bifunctional plasma of CO2 and H2 mixture through VHFPECVD (40.68MHz) for 20–50s, with a flow ratio of [CO2]/[H2]=1:20, to sow nanocrystalline seeds and preserve hydrogen contents in the passivation layers, maintain-ing the optimal passivation effect while restricting microcrystalline sowing on the shallow surfaces and inducing vertical growth of the subsequent doped nanocrystalline junctions. On this foundation, high-quality n- and p-type carrier-selective contacts can be achieved. Briefly, a 15-nm phosphorus-doped front n-type window layer (n+:nc-SiOx:H) grew on i:a-Si:H(2) as an electron collecting layer at a high hydrogen-to-silane gas-flow ratio of [H2]/[SiH4]/[PH3]=750:5:0.1, with[CO2]/[SiH4]=0.5±0.2 to balance the crystallinity fraction and optical bandgap. For the rear junction, the hydrogen-to-silane gas-flow ratio was further increased to [H2]/[SiH4]/[B2H6]=2,700:5:0.1, imple-menting a 22-nm boron-doped p+:nc-Si:H film with an ultrahigh XC of 63.4%. The n+:nc-SiOx:H and p+:nc-Si:H contacts were grown in the same chamber at a substrate temperature of 170°C. Afterwards, a 2.8% Ce-doped In2O3 (ICO) target was applied for depositing approximately 70-nm TCO layers on both sides in a low-damage reactive plasma depo-sition sputtering tool by using high-purity Ar as the sputtering gas at a substrate temperature of 100°C, and the coating process was less than 30eV ion bombardment, without damaging the microcrystalline emit-ters and the passivation layers. The contact-free LTP was carried out for grid lines with a line width of 18µm and the aspect ratio was optimized to 0.7. For certificated cells, an 80-nm MgF2 layer was capped onto the front side in a thermal evaporation instrument (ULVAC, EI-501Z).CharacterizationCurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured by a Vision VS-6821S I–V tester under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G, 100mWcm2, 25°C). The best SHJ solar cells were certified through total area measurement by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin. External quantum efficiency spectra were measured on the entire front surface including the grid-shaded area with a Bentham PVE300-IVT system and QE-RX (Enlitech), and the corresponding opti-cal loss was analysed using SQ-JVFL. HRTEM was conducted in an FEI Titan 80–300 Berlin Holography Special TEM and TF-G20 (Thermo Fisher), for which the cross-sectional samples were prepared by a focused ion beam technique. The atomic force microscopy images and morphology features were obtained with semi-contact mode and an OMCL-AC200TS cantilever probe by Ntegra Prima. Crystallinity fractions (XC), also calledcrystalline volume fractions,were extracted by Raman spectroscopy with a 325-nm UV light generated by a He–Cd laser, using a fitting Gaussian model. The optical characteristics of the layers, including absorbance, reflectance and transmittance, were measured using UV–Vis–NIR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 950), and the bandgaps (Eg) of the layers were calculated from the Tauc plots. The minority carrier lifetime was obtained by a Sinton WCT-120 flash tester in transient mode. The vertical conductivities (y) of the doped contacts, rather than the horizontal conductivities (x), were detected by a self-built probe system, because the charges move vertically in the cells. Traditional doped a-Si:H layers are homogeneous (that is, isotropic (y=x)), and it is rational and more convenient to probe x instead of y. However, the nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth induction process induces an oriented growth, producing anisotropic doped contacts (y>x), which causes unacceptable error if x is used instead of y. A Hall measurement system (Ecopia, HMS-3000) was used to determine the carrier mobility and conductivity of the TCO layers. The hydrogen content (CH) and microstructure factor (R*) were calculated from Fourier transform infrared responses captured by a Nicolet IS-10 spectrometer according to the following formulae.

The cell models were built in the Design Modeler, with an arc length of 166mm and an initial 500mm radius of curvature in the z–x plane, and the one-dimensional 166-mm curves were extruded in the y direc-tion to form two-dimensional curved surface geometries. Inputting the parameters(density: 2,330kgm3, Young’s modulus: 187GPa, Poisson’s ratio: 0.28, yield strength: 7GPa, tangent modulus: 63.7GPa, tensile yield strength: 350MPa) to the surface geometries, which were divided into 3-mm surface mesh in the Mechanical. Following that, remote displacement constraints in the y direction were applied to each of the straight edges, allowing displacement only in the x direc-tion and rotation only in the y direction, and the two straight edges were loaded with a horizontal force towards the centre. According to the first strength theory, the solar cells fracture when the maxi-mum principal stress exceeds or equals the limit of tensile strength, at which point the deformation of the solar cells in the x and z directions was recorded and the bending angle was calculated. The flexibility measurement of c-Si solar cells was completed by using a self-made programmed symmetrical extrusion system. Servo motors were used to control the relatively slow extrusion speed (1mms1) until the cells were broken, and the corresponding bending angles and radii of cur-vature were recorded.The concept of ‘bendability’ refers to the property of being bent without breaking, which can be quantified by various parameters in different pieces of literature. In this paper, two indices are used for evaluation (that is, the maximum bending angle () and the minimum bending radius of curvature (rb), and the relation formula is as follows. r l = 360°×2×× bin which l is the length of the arc (equal to the cross-sectional edge length 166mm).Encapsulation and ageing testThe solar cells were encapsulated with the EPE encapsulant (EVA/POE/EVA=1:x:1, x=1–1.2) into the modules, followed by measuring the initial maximum power (P0). The edges of the modules were attached with conductive copper tapes for grounding. The positive and negative terminals of the modules were connected to the high-voltage output power supply (1,500V). The stability and persistence were tested in a high-temperature (85°C) and high-humidity (85%) ageing cham-ber (H8-050) for 192h. Dividing the maximum power after theageing tests(P1) by the initial maximum power (P0), the degree of attenuation can be assessed. A schematic diagram of the PID ageing process can be found in Extended Data Fig.6. All of the encapsulation materials were pre-aged in the ageing chamber (UV-plus430 and GRO-SUV1010) at high temperature (85°C) and humidity (85%) with UV illumination (280–400nm, UVB accounts for 3–10% of the whole energy). The light-induced degradation ageing tests were conducted according to International Electrotechnical Commission 61215:2021.Absolute efficiency loss analysisThe power and efficiency losses were quantified by Quokka3 simula-tion. The models of the FT and SF cells were established, and the input parameters such as TCO square resistance, line resistance, TCO/nc-Si(Ox):H/a-Si:H(2)/a-SiOx:H(1)/c-Si contact resistance, surface recombi-nation rate and so on were directly measured by experimental charac-terization. From the model and fitting variables, other parameters can be derived, including Auger recombination, radiation recombination and Shockley–Read–Hall recombination. Following convergence of the simulated and measured electrical properties, the efficiency loss components were quantified at the maximum power point. The con-cepts and calculation details of the theoretical limit and practical limit can be found in the literature30.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in theNature  Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Data availabilityAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in the paper and its extended data files.

However, the large-scale production of SHJ cells is limited by the scarcity of indium-based Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) materials. To address this limitation, this study aims to prepare SHJ cells with less Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) consumption while maintaining performance (ITO-less cells). In particular, the material properties of ITO films with varying thickness was investigated and the impact of the silicon thin-film substrate on the growth mechanism of the ITO films and contact resistance was analyzed. By employing n-type nanocrystalline silicon (n-nc-Si:H) with a high crystallinity, the series resistance of ITO-less SHJ cells was minimized. Moreover, the incorporation of a LiF x  anti-reflection layer led to the successful fabrication of an ITO-less cell with a photoelectric con - version efficiency (PCE) of 21.28 %, consequently reducing ITO consumption by 75 %. These findings contribute to advancing the industrial-scale implementation of SHJ solar cells. 1.Introduction The effective passivation contacts have enabled silicon hetero - junction (SHJ) solar cells to achieve better performance compared to diffused junction cells, appears in a high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) surpassing 750 mV and a superior fill factor (FF). For bifacial contact SHJ solar cells, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.81 % has been demonstrated on large-scale industrial-size (M6, 274.4 cm 2 ) silicon wafer [ 1 ]. In contrast to the prevailing PERC cells in the market, SHJ cells offer several advantages, including elevated con - version efficiency, high bifaciality, and a simplified manufacturing process. Currently, the average PCE of PERC cell modules which domi - nate the market were around 20 %. However, research anticipate that by 2025, the average module efficiency of cells based on passivated con - tacts will exceed 22 % [ 2 ]. This expected improvement in efficiency holds great significance in reducing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Despite these advantages, SHJ cells require transparent conductive oxide (TCO) to achieve both high light transmittance and efficient lateral carrier transport. Regrettably, the most widely used TCO materials for SHJ cells predominantly rely on Indium (In)-based oxides, and the scarcity of In reserves coupled with its high cost poses significant obstacles to the large-scale industrialization of SHJ solar cells. Recent research efforts have been directed towards two main ap - proaches to minimize the utilization of Indium in SHJ cells. The first approach involves exploring In-free TCO materials, such as zinc oxide- based [ 3–5 ] or tin oxide-based [ 6 , 7 ] TCO materials. The research  * Corresponding author.

The second is to reduce the amount of TCO, and develop a SHJ cell structure with less or no TCO. The focus is to reduce the photoelectric loss caused by the reduction of TCO. For the first route, Wu et al. utilized AZO instead of ITO to design a p-type a-Si:H/AZO contact with low contact resistance, which is similar to the cell efficiency using traditional ITO [ 4 ]. Wang et al. utilized the structure of ITO 50 %/AZO 50 % on the rear side of the cell, and the PCE loss was only 0.1 % compared to pure ITO [ 5 ]. As for the second route, Han et al. utilized 25 nm tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) and 25 nm tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) for n-contact and p-contact respectively, which reduced the contact resistivity and obtained a PCE of more than 22 % SHJ solar cells, the TCO consumption is reduced by 67 % [ 8 ]. Gageot et al. utilized an ITO/SiN:H double-layer antireflective coating allowed for an SHJ cell with 15 nm-thick front ITO to achieve a PCE exceeding 22 %, while also demonstrating that nc-Si:H exhibits better UV stability than nc-SiOx:H, providing valuable insights for the devel - opment of ITO-less cells [ 9 ]. Cruz et al. proposed SiO 2  as the double-sided anti-reflection layer of SHJ cells to make up for the anti-reflection loss caused by thinning TCO. Using double-sided 20 nm TCO obtained a PCE of 24.6 % similar to that of the 75 nm TCO reference cell, and the TCO consumption was reduced by 73 % [ 10 ]. On the other hand, Li et al. completely removed the TCO of the light incident surface of the SHJ cell, and used ozone treatment to reduce the passivation quality caused by the direct contact between the metal and the amor - phous silicon, and obtained a photoelectric conversion efficiency of >22 % [ 11 ]. He et al. further utilized alkali metal fluoride/aluminum as the electron selective contact and transition metal oxide/silver as the hole selective contact, which reduced the contact resistance, and the PCE of the prepared full TCO-free cells exceeded 22.9 % [ 12 ]. According to the analysis of existing technical routes, TCO-less cells can minimize the usage of indium oxide-based TCO without affecting PCE, and the implementation method is simple, which has greater industrialization prospects. Based on this, this study focuses on the material properties of ITO films with different thicknesses, and analyzes the influence of nc-Si:H on the growth of ITO, optimizes the contact characteristics of nc-Si:H/thinned ITO, and finally obtains a PCE of 21.28 %. ITO-less SHJ solar cells, ITO usage is reduced by 75 %. 2.Experiment details FZ n-type c-Si wafers with a <100>crystalline plane orientation, a thickness of 180   m, and a resistivity of 3–5  cm 2  were utilized for the texturing process in a 1 % KOH solution. Alcohols were employed as additives during the texturing procedure. Subsequently, the textured c- Si wafers under standard RCA cleaning, followed by a treatment with 1 % HF to eliminate the oxide layer. The wafers were then loaded into a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system to deposit the passivation and carrier transport layers. Double-sided i-a-Si:H passivation layers were deposited, along with an n-a-Si:H (or n-nc-Si:H) electron transport layer on one side and a p-nc-Si:H hole transport layer on the other side, within the PECVD system.  Table 1 presents the pa - rameters employed in PECVD processes. ITO films with different thick - nesses were deposited by thermal evaporation, followed by the deposition of a silver electrode. Finally deposited LiF x  thin films by thermal evaporation. The film thickness was determined using a surface profilometer. The vertical resistance curve was measured using a Keithley 2400. The car - rier mobility and carrier concentration of ITO samples on glass were measured by Ecopia HMS-7000 Hall effect measurement system. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of ITO samples on glass were extracted from the J.A. Woollam Co. RC2 ellipsometer measurements by fitting to a Tauc-Lorentz model. The reflectance and transmittance of ITO samples on glass were measured by Varian Cary 5000 spectropho - tometer. The sheet resistance (R sheet ) of the ITO film on flat silicon wafer was measured using an RTS-5 four-point probe system. The contact resistance (  C ) was calculated by Cox ����Strack method [ 13 , 14 ]. The test structure employed was Ag/ITO/n-nc-Si:H/i-a-Si:H/n-c-Si/i-a-Si: H/n-a-Si:H/ITO/Ag, where the Ag electrode on the n-a-Si:H side is fully covered. Seven disc electrodes with different areas (0.1 cm 2 , 0.045 cm 2 , 0.0314 cm 2 , 0.0254 cm 2 , 0.02 cm 2 , 0.0113 cm 2 , and 0.0078 cm 2 ) were utilized on the n-nc-Si:H side. The Raman spectra of the materials on glass were measured by a Renishaw inVa Raman system with a laser wavelength of 532 nm to evaluate the crystallinity. For performance characterization, the current density-voltage (J-V) curve of the solar cells under standard conditions (AM1.5, 25  ◦ C, 100 mW/cm 2 ) was measured by a dual-light source solar simulator (Wacom Class AAA). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a PV Mea - surement QEX10 system. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Material properties of different thickness ITO The photoelectric properties of ITO materials are mainly controlled by its doping concentration, grain size and content of oxygen vacancies [ 15–17 ]. Therefore, the influence of thinning ITO on its material prop - erties should be considered first.  Fig. 1 (a) shows parameters such as resistivity, mobility, and carrier concentration of ITO with different thicknesses. It is evident that when the thickness of the ITO layer is ~10 nm, the resistivity becomes excessively high, with a significant reduc - tion in both mobility and carrier concentration. Consequently, it be - comes challenging to meet the requirements for efficient carrier transport. As the thickness of the ITO increases, the electrical properties of the material improve significantly. This is because achieving an adequate doping concentration and the formation of a stable cubic crystal phase require a certain degree of vertical growth. When the thickness of the ITO layer reaches 30 nm, the material exhibits a re - sistivity of 1.01 ×10�³ cm, a mobility of 32.66 cm 2 /Vs, and a carrier concentration of 1.9 ×10 2 � cm�³. These properties essentially fulfill the requirements for carrier transport in SHJ cells. As the thickness of the ITO layer increases beyond 60 nm, its influence on the electrical prop - erties tends to be saturated.  Fig. 1 (b) presents the XRD spectra of ITO films with varying thicknesses. As the thickness increases, the intensity of the diffraction peaks exhibits an upward trend, indicating an enhancement in crystallization. Additionally, the half-width of the diffraction peak at 2 =30.5 ◦ decreases, signifying an increase in grain size. Moreover, the increase in thickness also enhances the preferential growth tendency of the film along the (222) crystallographic orienta - tion. It is generally accepted that ITO films with a (222) preferred orientation exhibit higher transmittance, carrier mobility, and doping  Table 1 PECVD system parameters for silicon thin films.

Solar   Energy   Materials   and   Solar   Cells   282   (2025)   113422   2   concentration [ 15 , 21 ]. Therefore, when designing ITO-less solar cells, the impact of reduced thickness on the electrical properties of ITO must be carefully considered. The influence of ITO thickness on the optical properties of materials is also worth studying.  Fig. 2 shows the reflectivity, transmittance, ab - sorption coefficient, optical bandgap, and parameters such as refractive index and extinction coefficient for ITO of varying thicknesses.  Fig. 2 (a) shows that as the ITO thickness decreases from 110 nm to 30 nm, the transmittance of the film decreases while the reflectance increases within the wavelength range of 300–500 nm. This phenomenon is attributed to the refractive index mismatch or interference effects vari - ation induced by the thinning of the ITO layer, which reduces the antireflection efficiency. For wavelengths greater than 500 nm, the transmittance significantly increases as the film thickness decreases. This is attributed to the reduced free carrier absorption of long- wavelength photons caused by the thinning of the ITO layer. It is worth mentioning that a measurement artifact is observed is observed at 800 nm in part of the spectrum in  Fig. 2 (a), which results from the switching of the light source. However, this does not impact the overall conclusions of the experiment.  Fig. 2 (b) illustrates the reduction in long-  Fig. 1.(a) Resistivity, mobility and carrier concentration and (b) XRD spectra of ITO with varying thickness.

Li et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Solar �� Energy �� Materials �� and �� Solar �� Cells �� 282 �� (2025) �� 113422 �� � �� wavelength absorption as the ITO thickness decreases, which further supports the behavior observed at long-wavelength region in  Fig. 2 (a).  Fig. 2 (c) displays the optical bandgap of ITO films with varying thick - nesses, showing a slight decrease in the optical bandgap as the film thickness is reduced. This phenomenon is attributed to the Moss- Burstein effect [ 18 , 19 ], where the reduction in film thickness leads to insufficient doping concentration, causing the Fermi level to shift to - wards the forbidden gap, which consequently reduces the optical band gap.  Fig. 2 (d) illustrates the refractive index (n) and extinction coeffi - cient (k) of ITO as a function of thickness. When the ITO thickness ex - ceeds 60 nm, both n and k remain relatively unaffected by further thinning. However, as the thickness decreases to 30 nm, n@633 nm declines from approximately 2.0 to 1.7. This will result in a refractive index mismatch in SHJ solar cells [ 20 ], thereby compromising the antireflection performance. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the potential degradation of optical performance resulting from ITO thin - ning in SHJ solar cells is primarily attributed to the insufficient antire - flection effect. Consequently, when designing ITO-less structures, it is essential to implement additional strategies to compensate for the loss of antireflection performance. 3.2.Influence of silicon thin film substrate on ITO In the SHJ cell, n/p-doped silicon film act as the selective contact layer, which also serves as the substrate for the ITO layer. This substrate has a substantial impact on the growth characteristics and material properties of ITO during the initial stages of deposition. Particularly at lower ITO thicknesses, the influence of the substrate on the material becomes more pronounced.  Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of ITO deposited at different thicknesses on n-type doped silicon film substrates with varying crystallinity. In this experiment, the crystallinity for low   c  n-nc-Si: H is approximately 25 %, while for high   c  n-nc-Si: H is approximately 60 %.  Fig. 3 (a)–(c) show the SEM images of n-doped silicon films with varying crystallinity. Notably, the film with high crystallinity exhibits a well-defined grain structure.  Fig. 3 (d)–(f) corre - spond to 30 nm-thick ITO films grown on n-doped silicon films with varying crystallinity. Similar to single-layer silicon films, the surface of ITO grown on silicon films with high crystallinity has a more obvious grain structure.  Fig. 3 (g)–(i) shows the growth of 110 nm ITO films on silicon films with varying crystallinity and the surface morphology of this group of samples tends to be similar. Based on the aforementioned morphological characteristics, it can be inferred that the initial state of ITO growing on the surface of the silicon film is related to the crystal - lization state of the silicon film itself, and the silicon film substrate with high crystallinity can promote the rapid crystallization of ITO, thereby obtaining a more complete grain structure at lower thicknesses. How - ever, due to the sufficient vertical growth dimension of high-thickness ITO, exhibits a reduced correlation between the surface morphology and the substrate. The XRD spectra in  Fig. S1 further corroborates the aforementioned conclusion. The mobility of ITO is related to its degree of grain boundary scattering [ 21 , 22 ]. High-mobility ITO materials require reduced grain boundary scattering; therefore, it is necessary to increase the grain size to achieve ITO films with high photoelectric performance. For thin ITO films, utilizing a substrate with a high crys - tallinity is an effective approach to facilitate rapid crystallization. The contact resistance (  C ) between silicon film and ITO is a key factor influencing the series resistance (R series ) in SHJ solar cells. Considering the degradation of electrical properties due to the thinning of ITO, it is crucial to account for the impact of varying ITO thicknesses on   C .  Fig. 4 shows the   C  between n-type doped silicon thin films of varying crystallinity and ITO layers of different thicknesses. The statis - tical results indicate that when the ITO thickness is higher, the   C  be - tween ITO and n-type doped silicon film is directly proportional to the crystallinity of the n-type doped silicon film. Conversely, when the ITO thickness is lower, the   C  becomes inversely proportional to the crys - tallinity of the n-type doped silicon film. This is attributed to the dif - ferences in the behavior of ITO on different substrates such as crystal growth and hydrogen diffusion. The research presented in the previous section demonstrates that thin ITO films grown on substrates with sili - con thin films of high crystallinity exhibit enhanced crystalline degree, which reduces grain boundary scattering, thereby improving carrier mobility. In the case of thick ITO films, Cruz et al. observed a higher  Fig. 3.SEM images of (a)–(c) n-doped silicon films with varying crystallinity (d)–(f) 30 nm ITO films deposited on n-doped silicon films with varying crystallinity (g)–(i) 110 nm ITO films deposited on n-doped silicon films with varying crystallinity.

As a result, ITO grown on nc-Si exhibits a smaller average particle size compared to ITO grown on a-Si. Moreover, nc-Si: H significantly inhibits hydrogen diffusion during annealing to a greater extent than a-Si: H, leading to insufficient hy - drogenation of the ITO film [ 23 ]. The aforementioned two factors contribute to the reduced mobility of thick ITO deposited on a silicon thin-film substrate with a high crystallinity, which consequently higher   C . 3.3.Preparation of ITO-less SHJ solar cells The established SHJ solar cell technology employs n-a-Si:H as the electron transport layer on the light-incident side.  Fig. 5 shows the J-V and EQE curves of the cell after thinning ITO on the electron transport layer based on n-a-Si:H, while maintaining a constant thickness of 110 nm for the rear ITO layer. As shown in  Fig. 5 (a), when the thickness of the ITO layer on the light-incident side decreases from 80 nm to 20 nm, the V OC  of the cell remains nearly unchanged, while the J SC  gradually decreases. The FF initially exhibits minimal variation, but gradually decreases as the ITO thickness is further reduced (refer to  Table S1 ). The observed trend in J SC  is attributed to the reduction in ITO thickness,  Fig. 4.The contact resistance (  C ) between n-type doped silicon thin films of varying crystallinity and ITO layers of different thicknesses: (a) 80 nm (b) 56 nm (c) 45 nm (d) 32 nm (e) 20 nm, and (f) statistical chart of the mean values.

Li et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Solar �� Energy �� Materials �� and �� Solar �� Cells �� 282 �� (2025) �� 113422 �� 5 �� which reduces the anti-reflection effect and results in significant light losses at the front surface. As shown in the EQE curve of  Fig. 5 (b), the optical losses are most pronounced in the 400–600 nm wavelength range. The decrease in FF is primarily due to the increase in R series , which results from the rise in   C  as well as R sheet  following the thinning of the ITO layer, as shown in  Fig. 4 and  Fig. S2 . To further reduce the usage of ITO in SHJ cells, the effect of reducing the rear-side ITO thickness on cell performance was investigated, while maintaining the front-side ITO thickness at 80 nm.  Fig. 6 shows the J-V and EQE curves of the SHJ cells, in which the thickness of the rear-side ITO layer has been reduced from 80 nm to 20 nm. It can be observed that the V OC  is minimally impacted by the ITO thickness, while J SC  experi - ences a slight reduction of 0.35 mA/cm 2 , and the FF decreases from 69.05 % to 68.24 %. In comparison to the thinning of the front-side ITO, reducing the thickness of the rear-side ITO causes less degradation to the device parameters. This is primarily due to two factors: a) From an op - tical perspective, the requirement for the rear-side ITO’s anti-reflection effect is lower than that of the front-side ITO due to the presence of a full-area silver electrode; b) From an electrical perspective, due to the utilize of a full-area silver electrode on the rear side, the demand for lateral carrier transport in the rear ITO is also less critical compared to the front-side ITO. Based on the above analysis, further optimization of the front-side ITO thinning process is essential to enhance the perfor - mance of ITO-less solar cells. The experiments in Section  3.2 have demonstrated that for ITO-less structures, substituting n-a-Si:H with n-nc-Si:H can reduce the   C  be - tween n-type silicon film and thin ITO.  Fig. 7 (a) shows the J-V curves of SHJ cells of n-doped silicon films with varying crystallinity, measured under a front ITO layer thickness of 20 nm. The elevated crystallinity of n-nc-Si:H notably enhances the PCE of SHJ solar cell, primarily attrib - uted to the reduction in R series , which aligns with the observed decrease in   C . To further minimize the R series  of the cell, a seed layer was incorporated, and the thickness of the n-nc-Si: H layer was optimized, the schematic diagram of the cell structure is shown in  Fig. 7 (b).  Fig. 7 (c)–(f) present the statistical graphs of the cell parameters for n-nc-Si:H layers with thicknesses ranging from 4 to 8 nm. There is a certain lon - gitudinal microstructure evolution in the growth of microcrystals within n-nc-Si:H. For n-nc-Si:H layers with a thickness of 4 nm, both crystal - linity and doping efficiency are low, which limits carrier transport and reduces field-effect passivation. These lead to losses in both V OC  and FF. As the thickness of the n-nc-Si:H layer increases to 6 nm, both the field- effect passivation and carrier transport properties are enhanced, resulting in simultaneous improvements in V OC  and FF. As the thickness of the n-nc-Si:H layer is further increased to 8 nm, carrier transport losses and parasitic absorption both increases, leading to a reduction in J SC  and FF. Based on the above analysis, the optimal cell efficiency of 19.75 % is achieved when the n-type doped layer combines a seed layer with a 6 nm n-nc-Si:H layer, yielding V OC  ¼729.4 mV, J SC  ¼37.32 mA/ cm 2 , and FF ¼72.55 %. Compared to the reference cell (80 nm ITO in  Table S1 ), both V OC  and FF show improvements. However, there re - mains a loss in J SC , which is attributed to an insufficient anti-reflection effect. To compensate for the loss of front-side anti-reflection due to the reduced ITO thickness, an anti-reflection layer with a refractive index between that of air and ITO is applied to the ITO surface. This creates a refractive index gradient, effectively minimizing the loss of incident light on the front surface of the cell [ 24 ]. Lithium fluoride (LiF x ), with a refractive index of around 1.4, is commonly used as an anti-reflection layer in SHJ cells. To optimize the balance between anti-reflection ef - fects and transmission performance, the impact of varying LiF x  thick - nesses on cell performance was evaluated, as illustrated in  Fig. 8 (a)–(b). The optimal PCE is achieved when the LiF x  thickness is approximately 90 nm, at which the spectral response of the EQE reaches its maximum. The incorporation of a 90 nm anti-reflection layer results in a J SC  gain of approximately 2 mA/cm 2  compared to the cell without the LiF x  anti-reflection layer. Finally, employing the structure illustrated in  Fig. 8 (c), the ITO on both sides of the SHJ cell was reduced to 20 nm, and a 90 nm LiF x  anti-reflection layer was applied to the incident light surface. The champion PCE of the ITO-less cell is 21.28 %, with V OC  ¼738.7 mV, J SC  ¼39.32 mA/cm 2  and FF ¼73.28 %. Compared to standard SHJ cells (refers to  Fig. S3 ), this configuration achieves a 75 % reduction in ITO usage, while the PCE loss is only �0.47% abs . 4.Conclusion In conclusion, this study aims to develop ITO-less silicon hetero - junction solar cells. To achieve this objective, the impact of ITO thinning on material properties was investigated, followed by an analysis of the variations in the growth mechanisms of ITO on different substrates. Based on theoretical analysis and contact resistance measurements, the benefit of using n-nc-Si:H substrates with a high crystallinity to reduce n/ITO contact resistance has been quantified. The PCE of the ITO-less cell is enhanced through the application of a seed layer and optimiza - tion of the n-nc-Si:H layer thickness. Finally, a LiF x  anti-reflection coating is applied to compensate for the optical losses resulting from ITO thinning. The champion PCE achieved by the resulting ITO-less cell  Fig. 6.(a) J-V and (b) EQE curves of SHJ solar cells with varying ITO thicknesses on the rear side (Detailed cell parameters refer to  Table S2 .).

Improvements in the optoelectronic properties of these contacts can  enable higher device eciency, thus further consolidating the commercial  potential of SHJ technology. Here we increase the eciency of back junction  SHJ solar cells with improved back contacts consisting of p-type doped  nanocrystalline silicon and a transparent conductive oxide with a low  sheet resistance. The electrical properties of the hole-selective contact are  analysed and compared with a p-type doped amorphous silicon contact.  We demonstrate improvement in the charge carrier transport and a low  contact resistivity (<5mΩcm2). Eventually, we report a series of certied power conversion eciencies of up to 26.81% and ll factors up to 86.59% on  industry-grade silicon wafers (274cm2, M6 size).Photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are one of the main renewable energy sources with zero operating carbon emissions; driven by ambitious carbon neutral policies worldwide, they are quickly becoming a main-stream energy supply. To a large extent, power conversion efficiency (PCE) determines whether a PV technology is competitive. Wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells are the dominant technology in the global PV market. Aiming at a higher PCE, technology iteration is occurring from the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells17.SHJ technology employs an n-type (p-type) doped hydrogen-ated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer, called n-a-Si:H (p-a-Si:H), as the electron-selective contact layer (ESC)hole-selective contact layer (HSC). This overlays the intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon  (i-a-Si:H) layer, providing high-quality chemical passivation and  minimizing the deficit in open circuit voltage (VOC)813. The electrical performance of the solar cells depends strongly on the net doping of both the ESC and HSC layers. This is particularly relevant to the HSC layer, which is the emitter in SHJ solar cells based on n-type wafers. A sufficiently high doping concentration produces favourable band bending, allowing holes (minority carriers) to tunnel (selective collec-tion of holes); efficient field-effect passivation, repelling electrons from the interface and mitigating the resulting interface recombination; and a reduced energy barrier when directly in contact with the n-type trans-parent conducting oxide (TCO)1416. However, doped a-Si:H layers are always limited by unsatisfying electrical conductivity (σ<10‒4Scm−1)  Received: 21 December 2022Accepted: 24 March 2023Published online: 4 May 2023  Check for updates 1LONGi Central R&D Institute, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Xian, China. 2School of Materials, Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. 3Photovoltaic Materials and Devices Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands. 4These authors contributed equally: Hao Lin, Miao Yang, Xiaoning Ru.  e-mail: yinshi@longi.com; gaopq3@mail.sysu.edu.cn; xuxixiang@longi.com Nature Energy | Voume 8 | August 2023 | 789799790 technologies because of the excellent surface passivation provided by the i-a-Si:H layers. Figure 1b illustrates the FF versus VOC of different solar cell technologies, in which one can clearly see the superior FF of SHJ solar cells as compared with that of PERC and TOPCon devices.In Fig. 1b, the lines corresponding to the Green limits36 for dif-ferent ideal factors (n) are indicated as well. The value of the ideality  factor of a c-Si cell is based on the recombination mechanism: n=2/3 for Auger recombination and n=1 for Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) and band-to-band recombination at low injection level. Combining  high-quality c-Si wafers with the superior surface passivation we  obtained, the intrinsic recombination of SHJ solar cells becomes dominant. In the case of Auger recombination at high injection level, the ideality factor value of our SHJ cells is found to be lower than one. The reduction in ideality factor causes a more square shape in the  JV curve, leading to a remarkable improvement in FF.As indicated in Fig. 1, the performance of SHJ solar cells has increased almost linearly both electrically and optically. The first SHJ solar cell from our group (LONGi) delivered a PCE of 25.26% (ref. 37), and we have now further boosted all the PV parameters. In this work, we show a PCE of 26.81%, with VOC of 751.4mV (an improvement of 2.9mV), FF of 86.07% (0.57% improvement) and JSC of 41.45mAcm2  (an improvement of 1.97mAcm2), an overall efficiency gain of 1.55%.  Note that we achieved the highest FF of 86.59% on a different device:  that is, the cell delivering an efficiency of 26.30%. Theoretical predic-tions yield a similar trend, as shown by the blue to red gradient solid  line in Fig. 1b. Radiative, Auger and surface recombinations were taken into consideration in the calculation, while additional RS and shunt resistance (Rsh) were not included. The improvement of LONGi’s SHJ solar cells follows the overall tendency apart from small deviations in practical and calculated FF, which are mainly attributed to the  advance in reduction of RS. Note that the measurement approach (Methods) excludes some RS components, such as the resistance of the grid at the rear side and of the bus bars at the front side. We found that ultrahigh FF only occurs at extremely low RS and furthermore, requires high-quality passivation: that is, high VOC. This is why LONGi SHJ solar cells possess a prominent advantage in electrical performance (VOC×FF) (Fig. 1a) over PERC and TOPCon cells. Limited by insufficient passivation, the positive effect of reduced RS on FF cannot be fully unlocked for PERC and TOPCon cells.To reveal the main contributions to the efficiency increase, two related designs with p-a-Si:H (cell 1, 25.26% PCE) and p-nc-Si:H (cell 2,  26.30%) serving as the rear emitter are investigated with the Quokka2 software38,39. For the sake of simplicity, hereafter we name cell 1 and cell 2 as p-a-Si:H cell and p-nc-Si:H cell, respectively. Numerical simula-tions and fits to experimental data of RS and power loss analysis (PLA) are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2a shows the structure of the LONGi SHJ solar cells; the parameter variations between the p-a-Si:H cell and p-nc-Si:H cell are listed in Supplementary Table 3. The two devices  are in a front and back contact architecture on an n-type c-Si (n-Si) wafer with front-sided n-type nanocrystalline silicon oxide (n-nc-SiOx:H) and a back junction (BJ). Using BJ structure alleviates the electrical requirements on the front-side TCO and metal electrodes since a  large portion of the majority carriers (electrons) can be laterally  collected via the n-Si wafer absorber40. The main difference between the two solar cells comes from the BJ stacks; the p-nc-Si:H cell features  p-nc-Si:H and a tailored TCO with a sheet resistance of 40 per sqaure, while the p-a-Si:H cell features p-a-Si:H and a TCO with a sheet  resistance of 80 per square. Due to the excellent  and Ea of p-nc-Si:H, the rear contact resistivity is reduced, which will be discussed in the next section.Figure 2b,c shows the experimental and fitted J–V curves of  their related cells. The experimental curves include the real-light J–V curve (blue triangles) and the pseudo-light J–V curve tested by a Suns–VOC measurement (blue circles). The fitted J–V curves were simulated by Quokka2 (refs. 38,39). Input parameters were determined and relatively high activation energy (Ea>250meV), which cause  high contact resistivity in SHJ solar cells17–20.In contrast to defect-rich amorphous silicon, hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) dramatically improves film crystal-linity, which straightforwardly favours the improvement of carrier mobility and effective doping concentration. However, depositing a sufficiently thin layer of highly crystalline nc-Si:H on amorphous surfaces at low temperature is challenging. Depositing p-type doped nc-Si:H (p-nc-Si:H) is even more difficult, as boron doping restricts grain growth. Sophisticated techniques from deposition engineering, including pretreatment methods, adjusting deposition parameters (pressure, temperature, power, frequency and silane dilution) and post-treatment, help to address these issues21–25. For example, researchers discovered that CO2 treatment facilitates fast nucleation for the growth of nanocrystalline silicon film26. High crystalline volume fraction  (XC)—up to 50%—has been reported by several groups through fine- tuning gas flow rates21,25. Umishio et al.27 found a clear relation between the nanostructure evolution of the p-nc-Si:H layers and their electrical  properties and resulting performance. They concluded that surface  coalescence of the p-nc-Si:H nanocrystals, rather than doping  concentration, dominantly determines the Ea of the film27. In other words, hole selectivity and hole transport through the TCO–p-nc-Si:H contact and hence, the solar cell’s VOC and fill factor (FF) are crucially influenced by the electrical contact properties between TCO and the crystalline phase at the surface of the p-nc-Si:H layer19. Based on this understanding, the contact resistivity of p-nc-Si:H-based HSCs has been reduced to about 100mcm2, yielding a series resistance (RS) of 0.65–1.3cm2 and a 23–25% PCE (Supplementary Table 1)27–31. Nevertheless, realizing the advantageous electrical properties of SHJ solar cells  over their TOPCon counterparts still poses a challenge, and the oppor-tunity to unlock the full potential of SHJ technology remains open.In this contribution, we report the successful introduction of nanocrystallization processes for fabricating cutting-edge HSCs,  which—when paired with correspondingly tailored TCO—result in improved PCEs and FFs on wafer-scale single-junction SHJ solar cells. We demonstrate a 26.30% SHJ solar cell with an FF of 86.59%; to the best of our knowledge, this FF outperforms any other silicon solar cell. By reducing the shading ratio from 2.8 to 2.0% and modifying the window layers at the front to minimize the parasitic absorption, we further boost the PCE to 26.74% by increasing the short-circuit current density (JSC) to 41.16mAcm2. Finally, by introducing an additional reflective MgF2/Ag stack at the rear side and regulating the transmittance of TCO, we achieve a PCE of 26.81% with a JSC of 41.45mAcm2. Investigation of the power and series resistance losses reveals outstanding performance of these HSCs, with reduced contact resistivity (c<5mcm2) and improved passivation (recombination current density J0=0.5fAcm2). Structural and electrical characterizations of the p-nc-Si:H indicate high XC (63%), ultralow Ea (<115meV) and excellent  (>3Scm1), which is four orders of magnitude higher than that of the traditional p-a-Si:H film32,33. HSCs endowed with these electrical improvements easily  trigger band-to-band tunnelling (BTBT) transport behaviour and induce a sharp band bending, enhancing hole extraction efficiency.Efficiency increase analysis of SHJ solar cellsIn mass production, the competition between SHJ and TOPCon techno-logies is fierce. As can be seen from Fig. 1a, SHJ solar cells feature greater electrical performance measured by VOC×FF, while TOPCon and PERC hold relatively superior JSC. The inferior JSC of SHJ solar cells can be attri-buted to the strong parasitic absorption inherent in the functional layers at the front side; PERC and TOPCon usually yield higher JSC (>41mAcm2) due to the use of conventionally diffused front junctions and optically transparent antireflective coatings34. Benefiting from the unique design of rear-sided passivating contact with an SiOx/poly-Si(n+) stack, TOPCon wins out over PERC with intrinsically improved VOC  (ref. 35). SHJ produces the highest VOC among the c-Si solar cell  Nature Energy | Voume 8 | August 2023 | 789799 791 by the measured sheet resistance of the TCO, the line resistance of the  finger, the contact resistivity and recombination of the heterojunction. A full description of these parameters is in Supplementary Table 4.  For comparison, the corresponding intrinsic light J–V curves computed from the theoretical limit in electrical performance are also shown  (grey lines). Observe that the deviation between the Suns–VOC curve  and the light J–V curve (arrows enclosed by black circles) differs between the p-a-Si:H cell and the p-nc-Si:H cell. To explain this, note  that we can define a pseudo-fill factor (pFF) from a Suns–VOC curve ignoring all resistance. Both the p-a-Si:H cell and p-nc-Si:H cell have similar pFF values, which means that the difference in FF at the maxi-mum power point (MPP) originates from a difference in the series  resistance RS. Therefore, a smaller gap between the light and pseudo- light J–V curves in the p-nc-Si:H cell indicates a smaller RS.To explore how the record FF of 86.59% was achieved, we fit the J–V curves in Fig. 2b,c to determine power loss and series resistance, seen in Fig. 2d. The losses are divided into three regions: front ESC,  bulk silicon (bulk) and rear HSC. Figure 2d also shows the series resist-ance determined from the power loss at MPP. From the p-a-Si:H cell  to p-nc-Si:H cell, the total electrical power loss is reduced from 0.41  to 0.13mWcm2 at the rear HSC alone; this is nearly equal to the  full power loss reduction, 0.3mWcm2 (from 1.01 to 0.71mWcm2). This indicates that the improvement in electrical performance comes primarily from the rear HSC (as expected). In particular, the reduction of power loss at the rear HSC is attributed to the use of p-nc-Si:H and the updated TCO, which facilitates excellent passivation and contact  performance. The series resistance analysis shows the same trend as the PLA. The total RS is reduced from 381mcm2 for the p-a-Si:H cell to 206mcm2 for the p-nc-Si:H cell (Supplementary Fig. 2a); this differ-ence mostly appears at the rear HSC, at which RS is reduced from more than 130mcm2 to less than 20mcm2 (Fig. 2d). The slightly increased power loss in the bulk seen in the p-nc-Si:H cell could be caused by a small fluctuation in wafer quality. A slightly reduced RS of the front ESC (from 47 to 41mcm2) lies in the reduction of the sheet resistance of front TCO from ~150 to ~50 per square. Note that to ensure the credibility of the RS data, we measured the total RS at MPP with four different methods41, obtaining RS=353–381mcm2 (p-a-Si:H cell) and 175–206mcm2 (p-nc-Si:H cell), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2b.Characterization of p-nc-Si:HAs discussed above, the implementation of p-nc-Si:H together with matched TCO leads to a dramatic reduction in the contact resistivity at the rear side, resulting in an efficiency increase to 26.30%. As this contact, the overall resistance depends mainly on the bulk resistance of p-nc-Si:H itself and on the contact resistivity at the p-nc-Si:H–TCO interface. Therefore, gaining the optimal p-nc-Si:H layer is of critical importance to achieve high-efficiency SHJ solar cells. We investigated p-nc-Si:H layers grown from different recipes; corresponding deposi-tion conditions and characterization results are elaborated in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5. We studied the structural properties of the p-a-Si:H and p-nc-Si:H layers by both Raman spectroscopy and transmis-sion electron microscopy (TEM). The Raman measurement was carried out with a 325-nm laser and performed on the p-a-Si:H or p-nc-Si:H layer deposited on a planar i-a-Si:H–glass substrate. The deposition process was identical to that of the fabrication procedure for solar cells. The Raman spectra were fitted with multiple (or single) Gaussian functions, as shown in Fig. 3a. For p-nc-Si:H, three Gaussian peaks are identified  with the centres at 482, 507 and 518cm1, representing separately the transverse optical phonon mode of amorphous silicon and two optical vibrational modes of nanocrystalline silicon42,43. In contrast, only one peak at 478cm1 is observed for p-a-Si:H, indicating a fully amorphous structure. XC is determined from the integrated intensities (I) of the Gaussian peaks via equation (1) as follows44,45: XC= I 510cm−1 +I 520cm−1 βI480cm −1 +I510cm −1 +I520cm −1, (1) σρβσσρτσρτσσρσρτσρβσσρβρσστστττττβσσσσσστσ 	‒‒	 	 	­ρσµ	βρ		βσµ	τ  ρσρρσρτρ ρσρρτρτρρρρρσρσρ ρρρρρρσρτρτρρτ 	­ρσµ	ρ	  	­ ab Fig. 1 | Comparison of PV parameters of high-efficiency silicon solar cells. a, Measured PCEs of different high-performance c-Si solar cell technologies, including n-type wafer SHJ solar cells (n-SHJ) reported by LONGi and Hanergy, TOPCon solar cells reported by LONGi, Jinko and Fraunhofer ISE (FhG-ISE) and PERC solar cells based on p-type wafer (p-PERC) reported by LONGi and University of New South Wales (UNSW), overlaid on efficiency curves as a  function of electrical (VOC×FF) and optical (JSC) performances and normalized by the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit of a c-Si cell under standard test conditions.

For the p-nc-Si:H sample, an XC of 63% is obtained.The cross-sectional TEM images of the HSCs based on p-a-Si:H  and p-nc-Si:H are shown in Fig. 3b,c. The samples, namely TCO–p-nc-Si: H–i-a-Si:H–n-Si and TCO–p-a-Si:H–i-a-Si:H–n-Si, were taken by focused ion beam from as-prepared SHJ solar cells. In the TEM images, each layer in the stack is identified by its thickness, which was indivi dually measured and confirmed by ellipsometry. In both samples, the thick-ness of the i-a-Si:H layer is almost same (about 6nm), while the p-nc-Si:H layer (about 21nm) is much thicker than that of p-a-Si:H (about 5nm). A thicker p-nc-Si:H layer is required for incubation and for the subse- quent phase transition from amorphous to crystalline. The higher XC of the p-nc-Si:H layer is evidenced by the observation that nanocrystal-line domains embedded in an amorphous phase coalesce laterally to  one another. No crystalline feature is observed in the i-a-Si:H and p-a-Si:H layers. To identify nanocrystalline domains, fast Fourier trans-forms (FFTs) were performed on the TEM images (insets in Fig. 3b,c). In both samples, the reciprocal spots derived from the c-Si substrate are highlighted by red circles; these include high-order spots. In the p-nc-Si:H sample, additional reciprocal spots derived from nanocrys-talline domains can be seen. We performed inverse FFT calculations on the FFT images, masking selected reciprocal spots, to identify the corresponding nanocrystalline domains in the TEM images.

A large fraction of nanocrystalline domains is observed  in the p-nc-Si:H layer, while the amorphous structure of the i-a-Si:H  layer is completely intact, ensuring a well-passivated and contacted  silicon surface. In practice, the growth of the p-nc-Si:H layer on i-a-Si:H film is a great technical challenge, especially for high-efficiency devices, where the crystalline phase should be localized within a thin layer to  balance out detrimental parasitic absorption and resistive trans-port. Here, the strategy for highly crystalline p-nc-Si:H involves fast  nucleation at the initial stage, which was facilitated by CO2 plasma  treatment on its underlying i-a-Si:H layer47,48, and selective removal of the amorphous fraction by the plasma with high hydrogen dilution. This led to the accumulation of dense crystallites into the a-Si:H matrix28.Apart from the XC, electrical characteristics such as  and Ea can reflect the quality of doped films. As shown in Fig. 3d, the p-nc-Si:H layer on glass exhibits a high >3Scm1 and a low Ea<16meV. By con-trast, the p-a-Si:H layer on glass shows values of 104Scm1 and Ea350meV, respectively. The higher  and lower Ea values are thus obtained from the p-nc-Si:H layer. We computed Ea from the equation σ��σ������������E����k��T���������� where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvin49.  The values of Ea for p-type semiconductors describe the energy  difference between the Fermi level and the valence band maximum. A lower Ea in the p-nc-Si:H layer, therefore, indicates higher effective doping and work function. Note that the test films are deposited on two types of substrates (SiO2-coated textured silicon wafer and planar glass) using the same deposition processes. Correspondingly, the depo-sited p-nc-Si:H layer on glass is about 1.7times thicker than the layer grown on the pyramidal textured surface of c-Si wafer.

Nature Energy | Voume 8 | August 2023 | 789799794 the thickness sensitivity of XC and Ea31, the much smaller Ea value of the p-nc-Si:H layer on glass than that on the c-Si wafer is caused by varia-tions in the thickness-dependent crystallization fraction. It should also  be noted that the above tests are on samples without light soaking;  the Ea plots of the samples under light soaking are shown in Supple-mentary Fig. 4. With light soaking, the Ea and  values of both films  are slightly improved, except for the  of p-a-Si:H; this increases by a factor of two to three. Although light soaking is used in final devices, it occurs at the front side of the solar cell. Thus, we assume that  the properties of HSCs at the rear side are negligibly influenced, and  the p-a-Si:H- and p-nc-Si:H-layer properties without light soaking should approximate conditions seen by real devices.To evaluate the real device performance more accurately, we chose Ea values of 110.7meV (346.8meV) for p-nc-Si:H (p-a-Si:H) tested on  textured silicon wafers as input parameters for simulated band  diagrams. Here, to fit the tested I–V curves in Supplementary Fig. 5, the simulated I–V curves in Supplementary Fig. 6 were carefully regulated by adjusting the simulation parameters so that the accuracy of the technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulated band diagrams shown in Fig. 3e,f is ensured. The p-layer change leads to adjustments from three aspects: (1) conductivity of the p layer itself, (2) band bend-ing at the c-Si surface and (3) carrier transport at the TCO–p-layer inter-face. All the three aspects have favourable influences on minimizing resistive losses in the HSC and consequently, yielding maximal FF in the devices. The relevant interpretation is elaborated as follows.First, the p-nc-Si:H layer presents a much higher dark conductivity than the p-a-Si:H layer, which is beneficial for reducing resistive loss in the p layer itself. Second, compared with the p-a-Si:H case, the p-nc-Si:H layer has favourable band bending at the c-Si surface region. This is reflected by the smaller gap between the valence band maximum and the Fermi level (E) (insets in Fig. 3e,f). The reason for this is the lower Ea, hence higher work function, of the p-nc-Si:H sample. The accumula-tion of holes at the surface of n-Si for the p-nc-Si:H sample is also much higher than that of the p-a-Si:H case, leading to a larger difference between hole and electron concentrations and thus, an improvement in electrical passivation. Moreover, this enhanced band bending at the p layer–i layer–n-Si stack provides a lower and sharper energy barrier, which favours a collection of holes through tunnelling at the HSC. Accordingly, lower J0 and c in the p layer–i layer–n-Si stack is obtained. Third, holes in the p-layer valence band recombine with electrons in the TCO conduction band. As elaborated by Procel et al.50,51, the c  variations at the interface are linked to the dominating carrier transport mechanisms and can be influenced by the energy alignment of the p layer–TCO contact. The p-nc-Si:H–TCO interface features a lower hole transport barrier than the p-a-Si:H–TCO case, as indicated in  Fig. 3e,f. According to Fig. 3f, the energy alignment at the p-nc-Si: H–TCO interface could facilitate carrier transport through dominat-ing BTBT, which is widely considered to be the most efficient carrier transport mechanism. By contrast, at the p-a-Si:H–TCO interface, trap-assisted tunnelling, which is usually a less efficient tunnelling mechanism than BTBT, is likely to dominate; this is confirmed by our  simulated results in Fig. 3e. Therefore, a higher c at the p-a-Si:H–TCO  interface is to be expected. It should be mentioned that the band  gap of p-nc-Si:H (~1.7–2eV) is simplified to be consistent with that  of i-a-Si:H because it has little effect on the simulation result (J–V) if  the Ea of the doped layer is small enough50–52.Evaluation of holes selectivityThe replacement of the p-a-Si:H layer with a p-nc-Si:H layer improves the passivation quality and reduces c values at both the p layer–i-a-Si:H–n-Si contact and the TCO–p layer interface. These posi-tive effects contribute to delivering a larger hole selectivity of the HSCs. Figure 4a shows the distributions of simulated solar cell efficiency and hole selectivity as functions of c and J0. We extract c and J0 of HSCs based on p-nc-Si:H directly from the measurements shown in Fig. 4b,c, while those of p-a-Si:H are evaluated according to the fitting parameters in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1. The selectivity values are indicated by the blue lines, with S10=log10[Vth/(J0×c)] (refs. 53,54). For comparison, the S10 values of several typical HSCs with p layers of p-a-Si:H, p-SiCx:H and p-poly-Si:H are also included. As shown in Fig. 4a, from the top right corner to the bottom left corner of the plot, solar cell efficiency increases with the increase of S10 from 13 to 17. The solar cell with a p-nc-Si:H layer features S10>16, which is higher than solar cells using the p-a-Si:H (this work), p-SiCx:H (ref. 7) and p-poly-Si:H layers55,56. Provided that an ideal ESC and our p-nc-Si:H HSC are considered, the theoretical PCE of the resultant SHJ solar cells could reach up to 29.2%. σρβττ 	σρβτττ 	ρ‒τβ‒τβ‒		τ	 ­­­­­a­­­­­­τ­τ­τ­­­τ­­­­­­­­­­ρ	 b­­­­­ρ		τ		 	­τ­τ	­  ­	­­τ	 Fig. 4 | Evaluation of the carrier selectivity of HSCs based on a p-nc-Si:H layer. a, Plot of ideal PCE as a function of contact resistivity c and recombination current density J0 for different HSCs, assuming a 110-µm-thick undoped c-Si bulk and Jsc of 43.31mAcm2 per Richter’s limiting efficiency model.

Nature Energy | Voume 8 | August 2023 | 789799 795 Three methods—the Cox and Strack method (CSM)57, the expanded Cox and Strack method (ECSM)58,59 and the transfer length method (TLM)60—were utilized to extract the c of HSCs based on p-nc-Si:H. Emphasis was placed on the ECSM, which can directly extract  the c values of the TCO–p-nc-Si:H–i-a-Si:H–n-Si stack, as shown in  Fig. 4b. The other two methods, which evaluate the c through  measuring symmetric samples on a p-type silicon wafer (p-Si), are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. The coloured lines in Fig. 4b are the dark current–voltage (dark I–V) curves of the ECSM disks with different  diameters (the same as the CSM disks shown in Supplementary  Fig. 7a but with the n-Si wafer as the substrate). The inset in Fig. 4b shows total series resistance (Rt) from different disks plotted against inverse area (1S1). From the linear fit (red dashed line), we can extract a c of 3.6mcm2. For comparison, the results extracted from  CSM and TLM are 4.2 and 6.5mcm2, respectively.A symmetric structure, shown in the inset of Fig. 4c, was used to characterize J0 for the HSC based on p-nc-Si:H. The transient mode of a Sinton measurement was used for testing minority carrier life-time, and the results are indicated by red circles. The intrinsic recom-bination mode presented by Black and Macdonald61 was used to fit the data, tuning the parameters of SRH recombination (SRH; reflect-ing the quality of silicon wafer) and J0 (representing the quality of  surface passivation). The fitted total J0 is 1.0fAcm2. Considering the symmetry of the structure, it should be 0.5fAcm2 for the J0 of the p-nc-Si:H–i-a-Si:H–n-Si HSC.The achievements in electrical performance of the p-nc-Si:H  cell (26.30% PCE) define a state-of-the-art SHJ process on which advanced optical designs can be adopted to further promote PCE.  As shown in Fig. 5a, with the same BJ processing as the p-nc-Si:H cell, reducing the shading ratio from 2.8 to 2.0% after using the laser transfer process and modifying the window layers of n-nc-SiOx:H, i-a-Si:H and TCO at the front (such as reducing the thickness of n-nc-SiOx:H and i-a-Si:H, increasing the oxygen content of n-nc-SiOx:H and decreasing the carrier density of TCO) to minimize the parasitic absorption, we achieved a higher PCE of 26.74% with the increase of JSC to 41.16mAcm2. The slight reduction of FF is mainly due to the change of front metal fingers. In addition, VOC increases by 0.9mV, possibly enhanced by the higher JSC. The external quantum efficiency spectrum and main optical loss of each layer are shown in Fig. 5b. The absorption by n-Si fits well with the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH)-certified one, and the slight deviation at short wavelength may arise from the refractive indices used in the simulation. The front grid electrode causes a decrease of 0.97mAcm2 in JSC, accounting for a shading fraction of 2.0%. In the ultraviolet range, the front TCO, n-nc-SiOx:H and i-a-Si:H dominate the loss due to parasitic absorption. In the near-infrared range, the major source of loss is the escape of  light from the front, which is attributed to reflection by the test chunk due to the limited wafer thickness. With introducing an additional reflective MgF2/Ag stack at the rear side and regulating the transmit-tance of TCO, the JSC was further improved to 41.45mAcm2 due to  the optical gain, while FF decreased to 86.07% due to the decrease  of TCO conductivity. Finally, the PCE was improved to 26.81%. The certified J–V curve of the device is reported in Supplementary Fig. 8.ConclusionThrough introducing nanocrystallization technology in the doped layer at carrier-selective contacts for both polarities, we achieve a record effi-ciency of 26.81% and on a different cell, an extremely high FF (86.59%) on M6-sized BJ SHJ solar cells. Two types of SHJ solar cells equipped with p-type transporting layers of amorphous silicon and nanocrystalline silicon are comprehensively investigated; we study their power loss, contact resistivity, transport mechanism and so on. Structural and electrical characterizations of the boron-doped nanocrystalline silicon films indicate that a higher XC (>63%), an increase in conductivity of four orders of magnitude (in comparison with p-type amorphous silicon) and an ultralow Ea (<115meV) are the main causes of its excellent electri-cal performance. Because of the low Ea of p-nc-Si:H, it is easy to enable BTBT at the n-type TCO–p-nc-Si:H interface and achieve sharp band bending at the i-a-Si:H–n-Si interface, facilitating efficient transport and collection of holes across the whole junction. Our study shows that the implementation of p-nc-Si:H together with a modified TCO greatly reduces the contact resistivity of HSC, from >100 to <5mcm2. The total series resistance of the solar cell is reduced from the original 0.37 to 0.2cm2, yielding a record FF for single-junction silicon solar cell.MethodsSolar cell fabricationIn this work, solar cells were fabricated by the commercial SHJ research and development line on LONGi M2 (the 25.26% efficiency SHJ solar cell) or on an M6 Czochralski n-Si wafer with a resistivity of 1.2–1.5cm and a thickness of 130µm in (100) orientation. The n-Si wafer was first cleaned and textured by a wet chemical process. Before subsequent deposition, the thickness of the n-Si wafer was confirmed by weight measurement. Radiofrequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition was used to prepare i-a-Si:H, and then, very high-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (40.68MHz) systems  ‒ 	 	   ±‒	   ‒‒±	­­  ± ± ±	 ±	 		­ 		­ ‒		­ 		­ 		­µ 		­ ‒		­ 		­	 		­ 		­	 		­∆ Fig. 5 | Certified SHJ solar cell with a PCE of 26.74%. a, Light I–V and power–voltage (P–V) curves of the record front–back contact silicon solar cell.  b, External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum and analysis of the optical  loss, including reflection (R) and absorption (A).

Nature Energy | Voume 8 | August 2023 | 789799796 were used to deposit n-nc-SiOx:H, p-a-Si:H and p-nc-Si:H layers during the device fabrication. For the i-a-Si:H–n-Si interface of the 25.26% cell, an ultrathin 0.5- to 1.0-nm buffer layer, rich in H content, was intro-duced to improve the passivation.12 While for that of 26.30, 26.74 and 26.81% cells, an O-terminated Si surface, grown by a self-limiting wet chemical oxidation process (using HF/H2O2 solution), was introduced to suppress Si epitaxy62–64. Before deposition of p-nc-Si:H, CO2 plasma treatment was carried out on i-a-Si:H, which forms a thin barrier layer for impeding the damage. Supplementary Table 6 shows the detail parameters of the growth process for doped layers. The TCO layers used in 25.26% cells were prepared by direct current sputtering with rotationally target, while the updated TCO layers used in 26.30, 26.74 and 26.81% cells were grown by the reactive plasma deposition tech-nique. The material of the updated TCO is 1wt% CeO2 doped In2O3, while that of original TCO is SCOT (name of commodity; manufactured by Advanced Nano Products) for the front side and conventional 10wt% SnO2 doped In2O3 for the rear side of the device. Silver grid electrodes were printed followed by annealing at 190°C for 30min. With the improvement of the metallization process, the metal fraction of the front electrode for different SHJ solar cells decreased from 3.2 to 2.0%, while the rear electrode patterning with fingers and bus bars remained basically unchanged. For the above situation of 2.0% metal fraction, laser transfer process was introduced to make the front finger. To further increase JSC, a 150-nm-thick MgF2 film was evaporated on the front TCO layer as a second antireflective coating. For 26.81% cell, an  additional 120-nm-thick MgF2/150-nm-thick Ag stack was evaporated on the rear TCO layer, which means this cell is a monofacial solar cell.  Finally, light soaking under 60 suns was carried out for 90s at 190°C.PLATwo methods were utilized for the PLA of the solar cells with PCEs of 25.26% (p-a-Si:H cell) and 26.30% (p-nc-Si:H cell). One is based on Quokka2 software (as shown in Fig. 2), and the other is referring to a simple recombination model (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). For the Quokka2 simulation, the unit cell was modelled in two dimensions to calculate the power loss in the transversal transport of carriers between two fingers. The input parameters were primarily obtained from measurements 'Characterizations'. The line resistance of the finger and the contact resistivity of the heterojunction were consid-ered as series resistance in an external circuit. The optical path-length factor (Z) was set as 4n2, and the transmittance was adjusted to match the simulated JSC to that of actual cells. The SRH of the silicon wafers was  set by adjusting the values of n, p and the defect density of the SRH defect (Nt). SRH, J01 (surface recombination) and Rs were further tuned to obtain agreement between the light J–V and the Suns–VOC curves. Richter’s  Auger mode was chosen, and the value of radiation recombination was changed to 0.4×Brad with a photon recycling probability of 0.6 (ref. 65). Other parameters in the simulation are listed in Supplementary Table 4.  It should be noted that since band gap narrowing is not considered in this model, the corresponding VOC may deviate somewhat from the experimental value. For the simulation by the simple recombination model method, we first assume a uniform quasi-Fermi level and then fit the Suns–VOC and light J–V curves by adding the formulas of intrinsic recombination, SRH recombination, surface recombination, series resistance and so on. The specific fitting parameters, consequent results and corresponding descriptions are shown in Supplementary  Discussion 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1.Electrical simulationThe band diagrams in Fig. 3e,f and the dark I–V curves in Supplementary Fig. 6 were calculated by using Sentaurus TCAD based on drift-diffusion models. The simulation structure of the testing device is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 7a but with n-Si as the substrate: that is, a stacked film of Ag–TCO–p-nc-Si:H (or p-a-Si:H)–i-a-Si:H on bulk n-Si with a disk shape on the front surface and a full-area ohmic contact on the rear surface of the n-Si substrate. Physical models, including surface recom-bination, Auger recombination in substrate and thermionic emission  at proper interfaces, are taken into consideration. Moreover, p-a-Si:H and p-nc-Si:H layers feature spatially uniformly distributed traps in the exponential and Gaussian energy distributions50. Trap-assisted tun-nelling and BTBT models are also considered at the TCO–p-nc-Si:H (or p-a-Si:H) interface. The specific film parameters are shown in Supple- mentary Table 7. The simulated results are consistent with the experi-ments (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6 and Supplementary Discussion 2).Optical simulationThe optical simulation in Fig. 5b was performed using the SunSolve software provided by PV Lighthouse. In the simulation, we use refrac- tive indices from the literature66–70 except for the TCO film, which we measured by ellipsometry. In SunSolve, ray tracing and thin-film optics were adopted with a Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling and averag-ing the absorption in each layer. Here, 1million rays with zero zenith angle and air mass 1.5G were randomly generated for better confidence of the statistics; the 95% confidence interval of cell absorption is less  than 0.01mAcm2.CharacterizationsThe light J–V curves of the solar cells were tested and certified by ISFH (Supplementary Fig. 8); goldρcoated brass chuck was used to mount the solar cells, and the resistance of the grid at the rear side and of bus bars at the front side was neglected. The pseudo light J–V curves were extracted from a Suns–VOC measurement. The Suns–VOC mod-ule of a Sinton WCT-120 instrument was used to collect the changes in voltage of the device by reducing the light intensity of the flash-light; these were computationally transformed them into Suns–VOC curves. Raman spectra were obtained with a Horiba LabRAM Odyssey  Raman spectrometer with a 325-nm excitation laser. Test films were deposited on cleaned glass substrates using the same deposition pro-cesses as the solar cells. The morphology of heterojunctions, consisting of TCO-coated doped amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon films  on c-Si bulk, was observed by TEM, and the test samples were prepared by the focused ion beam method. Activation energies were calculated from measurements of electrical conductivity as a function of test temperature. Electrical conductivities were calculated from I–V curves measured by a semiconductor analyser (Keithley 4200A-SCS). It should be noted that the 50-nm isolation layer of SiOx film was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition before the deposition of p-nc-Si:H or p-a-Si:H on the pyramid-textured silicon wafers. Contact resistivity tests were carried out using the CSM, ECSM and TLM; the details are shown in Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7. Sinton’s minority carrier lifetime test was used to characterize the passivation quality on a symmetric structure of p-nc-Si:H–i-a-Si:H–n-Si–i-a-Si:H–p-nc-Si:H (Fig. 4c). The transient mode of a Sinton measurement was used for testing the minority carrier lifetime. Pyramid-textured n-Si wafers with a thickness of about 130µm and resistivity of about 1.59cm were used as the substrates.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature  Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Data availabilityAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in the published article and its Supplementary Information.

This study presents a theoretical model of boron diffusion in silicon using molecular dynamics. The research examines the mean square displacement and diffusion coefficient of boron atoms at varying temperatures, confirming their diffusion behavior. The simula - tions indicate predominant boron diffusion in the z-direction within the silicon matrix, with the diffusion depth being temperature dependent. The optimal temperature range for boron diffusion in silicon is identified as 950  ◦ C to 1050  ◦ C. Using boron-doped silicon paste and boron trichloride as dopants, thermal diffusion experiments were conducted to fabricate the front-field PN junction (p + layer) and selective emitter (p ++ layer) by one step. Subsequent processing and performance evaluation were performed on a production line. Experimental findings reveal a decrease in boron diffusion at higher temperatures, reduced sheet resistance, increased doping con - centration, and deeper junction formation. The ideal boron concentration in the p + layer is 8.68 ×10 18  atom/ cm 3  with a depth of 0.53   m, while the p ++ layer is 2.35 ×10 19  atom/cm 3  and 0.82   m. The efficiency of the optimized TOPCon +cell production line reaches up to 25.17 %, marking an improvement of 0.23 % over the standard cell production line. This research contributes to elucidating the mechanism of boron diffusion and offers insights for enhancing the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells.    1.Introduction In recent years, tunnel oxide passivation contact (TOPCon) solar cells have attracted significant attention among researchers due to their notable efficacy in solar energy conversion [1–5]. The diffusion of boron (B) on the front surface of n-type TOPCon cells plays a pivotal role in establishing PN junctions, resulting in the formation of a lightly doped p + layer [6–8]. The concentration and depth of this diffusion layer have a direct effect on the generation and recombination of photogenerated carriers [9,10]. Concurrently, localized diffusion of high-concentration B elements beneath the printed metal electrode region leads to the creation of a selective emitter(SE), forming a heavily doped p ++ layer. This, in turn, enhances the contact between the silicon (Si) substrate and the metal electrode, thereby facilitating the carrier output [10]. The selection of diffusion concentration and depth for both the p + and p ++ layers significantly influences the electrical parameters of the TOPCon cell [11]. Consequently, it becomes crucial to conduct an in-depth analysis of the B diffusion mechanism, optimize the diffusion process, and attain the appropriate diffusion characteristics for the p + and p ++ layers [11,12]. These steps are primary for further enhancing the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of solar cells. Currently, the body of theoretical research on B diffusion, especially at the atomic scale, remains relatively limited. Babak Sadigh et al. [13] determined the diffusion path of B in Si based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) energies obtained through local-density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation(GGA). However, their study did not investigate the specific effects of the doping process on B diffusion. Kurachi et al. [14] established a physical diffusion model for the thermal diffusion of borosilicate glass films (BSG), albeit limited in its ability to visually observe atomic-level  *Corresponding author at: Hope Avenue Road 1, 224051, Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China.

Molecular dynamics, on the other hand, provides a more intuitive portrayal of the complex mechanism and patterns of B atom migration [15], which can predict B atom diffusion characteristics at the atomic scale. Therefore, molecular dynamics methods enables a deeper and more accurate understanding of the B atom diffusion mechanism. In contrast, there is an abundance of reports pertaining to the experimental investigation of B diffusion. Researchers have systemati - cally explored the mechanisms and applications of B diffusion through process optimization, analysis of influencing factors, investigation of diffusion kinetics, and implementation of surface protection measures. For instance, Wang et al. [16] achieved precise control over the rate and profile of B diffusion by altering key process parameters in B trichloride tube furnace diffusion, including driving temperature, oxidation tem - perature, and B trichloride gas flow. Consequently, they obtained peak concentrations of the prepared p ++ and p + layers, measuring 3.3 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3  and 6.6 ×10 18  atoms/cm 3 , respectively. This effectively mitigated the electron concentration at the effective surface, thereby reducing recombination. Cheng et al. [17] deposited a PECVD B-doped a-SiOx: H layer onto an n-type c-Si wafer as a doping source. Subse - quently, through the optimization of PECVD deposition and subsequent annealing/etching processes, they achieved a B diffusion zone with sheet resistance ranging from 60 to 100 / and a junction depth of 1.2–1.5   m. While the aforementioned research methodologies have yielded specific results in B diffusion experiments, they fall short in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of B diffusion. To comprehen - sively understand B diffusion, it is crucial to combine experimental data with simulation. Furthermore, the present methodology for fabricating the p + and p ++ layers is intricate, necessitating multiple B diffusion steps in both laser doping and two-step diffusion techniques, which greatly increases cost. Therefore, Li et al. [18] introduced the concept of the B SE structure through one-step diffusion method using masks and etching. By employing the optimized B SE, they determined the appropriate sheet resistance for the p + layer and the optimal range for the junction depth of the p ++ layer. Nevertheless, this technique is constrained by its intricate technological demands, exacting precision prerequisites, and substantial costs, thereby impeding its widespread implementation within the industrial sphere. In this paper, We initially simulate the diffusion process of B atoms within Si wafers at various temperatures and durations using the mo - lecular dynamics method. Through simulation, we scrutinize the diffu - sion behavior and thermal diffusion patterns of B atoms, ultimately calculating the diffusion coefficient of B in Si. Subsequently, a new method for preparing PN junction and SE are proposed. The traditional B trichloride and B-doped Si paste were used as doping sources to conduct B diffusion experiments, and then p + and p ++ layers were formed in a tube diffusion furnace by one step. The method has low cost and simple operation, can simplify the B diffusion process, and can expand the gap of doping amount between p + and p ++ layers. Then, the influence of time and temperature on the diffusion characteristics of B atoms was analyzed and an optimization experimental scheme was proposed. The appropriate sheet resistance in p + layer and the optimum range of the junction depth in p ++ layer were determined. Using the optimized one- step B diffusion process, the batch efficiency of TOPCon +solar cells can achieve a gain of 0.1–0.3 %. 2.Molecular dynamics modeling Molecular simulation [19–22] stands as a potent tool for scrutinizing the structural characteristics, properties, and physical–chemical in - teractions among nanoscale particles. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted utilizing the LAMMPS software package. The simulation employed the Tersoff [23] potential to depict the in - teractions among Si atoms, providing a commendable balance of per - formance and substantiated accuracy in simulating Si interactions. For the interactions involving B-Si and B-B, the nuclear force Yukawa [24] potential was employed. The initial configuration of the B-Si diffusion model comprised monocrystalline Si at the bottom and B-doped Si at the top. The monocrystalline Si was oriented along the (1,0,0) ideal plane, with a vacancy content of 0.01 %. To facilitate the study of B diffusion behavior, 10 % of Si atoms were randomly replaced by B atoms in the upper section of the model, creating the diffusion layer, while the Si substrate remained below it. Importantly, this simulation exclusively focuses on the diffusion of B atoms and does not consider the presence of other impurity elements. The simulation region dimensions were set at 61 Å ×61 Å ×88 Å, accommodating a total of 9417 atoms. Periodic boundary conditions were enforced in the transverse (X and Y) di - rections, effectively emulating an infinite planar Si crystalline. Addi - tionally, the bottom of the monocrystalline Si and the top of the B-Si mixture (1.6 Å thickness) were held fixed along the vertical Z direction. The simulation assumed that the initial atom velocities conformed to the Maxwell distribution, and the Velocity-Verlet algorithm was employed to calculate the Newton motion integral equation. To estab - lish equilibrium with a constant number of atoms, pressure, and tem - perature (NVT), the Nose-Hoover thermostat was utilized, relaxing the system to 300 K over a duration of 10 ps. Subsequently, the temperature was rapidly increased to the preset value and maintained for 6 ns. Throughout the entire simulation, the external pressure remained at atmospheric levels, and a time step of 1 fs was employed. Notably, B atoms can only diffuse into Si at sufficiently high temperatures. There - fore, considering the experimental process parameters, temperatures of 750  ◦ C, 850  ◦ C, 950  ◦ C, and 1050  ◦ C were taken into consideration in this study. Snapshots from the LAMMPS simulations were visualized using Ovito. The diffusion snapshots at different temperatures after 6 ns relaxation are shown in Fig. 1(To increase contrast, we zoom in or out on the size of the atoms). 3.Experimental section 3.1.B-doped Si paste preparation In this study, the controlled doping of B into Si nanoparticles was achieved through a combination of the ball milling method and thermal annealing process [25,26]. BS20 [12] was synthesized using an opti - mized ball milling procedure, and subsequently, B-doped Si paste was successfully formulated using BS20 NPS and an organic carrier.

The excellent printing characteristics of this film ensure uniform B-doping of Si wafers during the subsequent thermal diffusion process. A detailed account of the specific preparation process and process optimization can be found in prior work [12]. 3.2.Thermal diffusion experiment and TOPCON cell preparation The preparation of thermal diffusion experimental samples involved the use of Czochralski (Cz) n-type c-Si wafers with 〈100〉orientation, measuring 182 mm ×182 mm ×0.16 mm in size and possessing a re - sistivity in the range of 1–1.1 cm, which were chosen for this study. Initially, a 25 wt% NaOH (Aladdin, 99.9 % metals basis) solvent was employed to eliminate saw damage and subjected to a 15 min treatment at 85  ◦ C. Subsequently, B-doped Si paste was screen-printed onto the c-Si wafer, utilizing two distinct screen printing patterns. One pattern comprised a 20 mm ×20 mm square, with a thickness of 10   m (EOM thickness), designed for assessing sheet resistance and doping perfor - mance. The other pattern took the form of a 30   m wide, 10   m thick (EOM thickness) line intended for creating deep p ++ /n junctions in SE. Following the screen printing process, the Si paste-coated Si wafers were dried at 230  ◦ C for 30 s. Subsequently, these Si wafers were spaced at approximately 15 mm intervals and subjected to annealing at tem - peratures of 750  ◦ C, 850  ◦ C, 950  ◦ C, and 1050  ◦ C, each for durations of 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min. The heating rate during annealing was maintained at 5  ◦ C/min within a tubular furnace under a nitrogen at - mosphere. After the diffusion process was completed, the BSG and Si paste were removed by 1–––5 wt% HF (Amethyst 40 %, for analysis) and 15 wt% KOH solvent, then the B-doping performance of p + and p ++ layer were measured by ECV. The fabrication of TOPCON cells was executed on a production line with a capacity of 15 MW, owned by Jiangsu Runyang Yueda Photo - voltaic Technology Co., Ltd. The precise preparation procedure is as follows: the initial Si wafer treatment involved chemical cleaning and etching to eliminate surface contaminants and mechanical imperfec - tions. Following cleaning, double-sided texturing was performed. Sub - sequently, the application of Si paste on the front surface of the Si wafer, following the metal electrode pattern, was carried out to create a paste- coated area. High-temperature thermal diffusion was employed to induce a reaction between the paste and the borosilicate glass within the paste-coated region. This led to the transformation of BSG into a B-Si mixture. The Si wafer, arranged in a back-to-back configuration, was then placed in a tube diffusion furnace for B diffusion. This process resulted in the formation of both shallow and heavily doped B zones, with BSG forming on the B expansion surface. The Si wafer underwent B diffusion within a high-temperature annealing (20 min at 950℃) furnace to establish the final PN junction, as depicted in Fig. 2. After removing the BSG layer from the back of the Si wafer using a chain hydrofluoric acid machine. Subsequently, the Si wafer was transferred to an alkaline polishing machine, the rear side undergoes alkaline etching using an 80℃ KOH solution to achieve a reflectance of over 30 %. Following the polishing step, the rear stack comprising SiO x  (1.1–1.5 nm) and a-Si (90 ±20 nm) was fabricated utilizing low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) technology. Subsequently, the prepared sample underwent annealing in a tube furnace at 900℃ for 45 min in the presence of a mixture of POCl 3 , O 2 , and N 2  to induce the crystallization of a-Si into poly-Si, while also doping it with phosphorus. During this process, the phosphorus within the deposited phosphorus- doped poly-Si layer formed covalent bonds with Si, providing elec - trons and creating a field passivation structure. Subsequently, again cleaning the wafers and removing phosphosili - cate glass (PSG) on the back and the BSG and Si paste on the front. Then the poly-Si wraparound side was etched in inline treatment with HF and batch-type treatment with a mixed solution of KOH and polishing ad - ditives. Passivation layers were deposited on the front and back surfaces. An aluminum oxide layer (3 nm-AlO x ) was deposited on the front surface using ALD equipment for passivation, while a Si nitride layer (82 nm- SiN x ) was deposited on the front surface using PECVD equipment for antireflection. A Si nitride passivation layer (82 nm-SiN x ) was deposited on the back surface using PECVD. Electrodes were created by screen printing pastes onto the front and back surfaces. The front printed pattern of the wafer corresponds to the screen pattern of the applied Si paste, while the back adheres to the standard production line’s pattern grid design. The front metal electrode with 15–––25   m width and 5–––10   m height was screen printed above the p ++ layer, where the three dots with a diameter of 80   m as mark points were used for alignment. Finally, the Si wafer underwent optical injection processing and was subjected to testing. In comparison to the traditional TOPCon cell fabrication process, the key difference is that the B-diffusion step uses a one-step method to prepare the p + / p ++ layer, which is not present in the conventional Si wafer preparation process. A detailed overview of the preparation process is depicted in Fig. 3. 3.3.Test and analysis tools The B doping curve was tested by the electrochemical capaci - tance–voltage (ECV) method. The electrical I-V performance of the cell was characterized by a Halm tester. The sheet resistance of the Si wafer is measured by the four-point probe method. 4.Results and discussion 4.1.Modeling results 4.1.1.Diffusion of B in Si at different temperatures Fig. 4 and 5 depict the B atom diffusion process. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the position distribution of B atoms at various temperatures is shown, while Fig. 5 displays the position distribution of B atoms at different time intervals at 950  ◦ C. The quantity and depth of B atom diffusion are influenced not only by the diffusion temperature but also by the duration of diffusion. Higher temperatures and longer durations result in increased B atom diffusion from the source to the opposite side, leading to greater diffusion depth. Specifically, at 750  ◦ C and 850  ◦ C, B atom diffusion is relatively insignificant, with only a minimal number of atoms diffusing along the z-axis direction. The number of diffused B atoms is small, and the diffusion depth is shallow at these lower temperatures. In contrast, as the temperature increases to 950  ◦ C and 1050  ◦ C, the depth of B atom diffusion significantly increases, and the quantity of diffused atoms substantially increases compared to that at lower temperatures. In Fig. 5, it can be observed that after 200 ps of diffusion at 950  ◦ C, only a small quantity of B atoms diffused into the Si matrix. However, with increasing simulation time, both the number of diffused B atoms  Fig. 2.Process scheme of one step for p + and p ++ layer formation: (a) before diffusion: screen printing B-doped Si paste, (b) after diffusion: p + /n and p ++ /n junction formation.  X. Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and the depth of diffusion progressively increase. Over an extended duration, such as 6 ns, the number and depth of B atom diffusion sub - stantially increase. This behavior arises primarily due to the atomic characteristics of B, which has an atomic radius of 0.082 nm, while the Si atom possesses a radius of 0.118 nm, resulting in a mismatch ratio of 0.75. Consequently, lattice tension is generated during the diffusion process [27], leading to a slow diffusion rate and low solid solubility of B in Si. Hence, higher temperatures and longer durations are needed to facilitate effective diffusion. Typically, B diffusion behavior becomes prominent above 900  � C. In Fig. 6, the concentration variations of B atoms in the z-direction following diffusion periods of 0 ns, 1 ns, 3 ns, and 6 ns at 950  � C are displayed. It is evident from the figure that the concentration of B atoms exhibits a consistent trend with time at each temperature: the concen - tration at the initial position (the B source region) diminishes over time, while the concentration at deeper levels (the doping region) increases with time. Moreover, at the same diffusion duration, higher tempera - tures result in lower surface B concentrations and deeper diffusion depths of B atoms. This observation signifies that B atoms continue to diffuse into the Si matrix over time, and higher temperatures lead to lower surface B concentrations and greater diffusion depths. However, when temperatures reach 950  � C and 1050  � C, the differ - ence in surface B atom concentrations becomes less pronounced. Nevertheless, the diffusion depth at 1050  � C surpasses that at 950  � C. This implies that when the B source concentration remains constant, there is a critical temperature threshold beyond which the number of B atoms in Si saturates, making it challenging for B atoms from the source to further diffuse into Si. At this point, B atoms within Si continue to penetrate deeper over time. Additionally, the depth of B atom diffusion can be inferred from the concentration distribution, with the depth approximately determined based on the concentration range. As depicted in Fig. 7, at temperatures of 750  � C, 850  � C, 950  � C, and 1050  � C, the maximum diffusion depths are measured at 0.236 nm, 0.248 nm, 0.264 nm, and 0.346 nm, respectively. This result substantiates that the depth of the diffusion layer is influenced by both temperature and duration. Higher tempera - tures and longer diffusion times result in greater diffusion depths. In addition, it can be clearly seen from the figure that after the temperature reaches 950℃, the average diffusion depth increases significantly, and the maximum diffusion depth also increases significantly. This shows that 950℃ is the turning point of B diffusion. 4.1.2.Diffusion coefficient To prevent the nonphysical influence of ensemble pressure on the simulation box size, the entire system’s dynamic calculation is con - ducted using the NVT ensemble. Following an initial relaxation period, the current coordinates of the B atom are recorded. Subsequent simu - lations involve periodic calculations of the mean square displacement (MSD) of the B atom in relation to these recorded coordinates. The MSD data collected during the sampling interval are used to generate a curve depicting how MSD changes over time. When this curve exhibits a linear increase, the diffusion coefficient of the B atom can be calculated uti - lizing the Einstein formula. MSD represents the mobility of particles, in- unit Å 2 , and its calculation method is as follows: ·×∗¼h÷ 2 ð⋄Þi¼ 1±∑ ±∓¼1 �j÷ ∓ ð⋄Þ�÷ ∓ ð0Þj 2 )(1)  Fig. 3.Comparison of the TOPCon þand TOPCon battery prepara - tion processes.

Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       where 〈〉pairs should average all atoms in the group, and N corresponds to the number of atoms in the group. In this study, based on the principles of the fluctuation–dissipation theory in statistical mechanics, two equivalent formulas can be employed to determine the diffusion coefficient (D) (m 2 /s) in molecular dynamics simulation. The first method involves the Einstein relation, which is calculated using the MSD: ∗=lim ⋄ 16⋄〈|÷ ∓ (⋄)�÷ ∓ (0)| 2 〉= 16 ⊕(·×∗)⊕⋄(2) The other is the Green Kubo formula calculated by the velocity autocorrelation function. ∗= 13∫ 0 〈⊖ ∓ (⋄)ˆA⊖ ∓ (0)〉⊕⋄(3)  where r i (t), r i (0)and v i (t), v i (0)correspond to the displacement vector and velocity vector of the particle at time t and time 0, respectively. The Green Kubo formula necessitates extensive statistical integration of the velocity autocorrelation function to derive the diffusion coeffi - cient. In contrast, the Einstein formula directly relates to the MSD ob - tained from simulation results, offering a simpler and faster approach. To expedite data processing while ensuring the reliability of the calcu - lated results, the diffusion coefficient of B atoms within the Si matrix was determined using the MSD method in this simulation. According to Formula 1, the diffusion coefficient is essentially one- sixth of the slope of the MSD-t curve. Fig. 8 illustrates the relationship between the MSD of the system and time at various temperatures over a duration of 6 ns. These curves consistently exhibit a common trend: the MSD-t curve increases with both time and temperature. This observation underscores that higher temperatures lead to increased hopping fre - quencies of B atoms.

Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       These MSD-t curves were subjected to linear fitting, and the corre - sponding diffusion coefficients were computed using Formulas 1 and 3. The relationship between the diffusion coefficient of B atoms and tem - perature is presented in Fig. 9. It is evident that within the simulation system, higher temperatures lead to larger diffusion coefficients for B atoms. The findings indicate that when the temperature reaches 950  ◦ C, there is a substantial increase in the diffusion coefficient of B. Therefore, the appropriate temperature range for B diffusion should fall within 950–––1050  ◦ C. These simulation results align well with the experi - mental data, affirming their consistency with the expected trend. The dominant axis of B atoms at temperatures of 750℃, 850℃, 950℃, and 1050℃ is observed to be the Y-axis, Z-axis, Z-axis respec - tively, as depicted in Fig. S1. It is evident that the diffusion of B atoms primarily occurs along the Z-axis. The reason for not observing a pre - dominant Z-direction diffusion at 750℃ is attributed to the low tem - perature which results in a lower B diffusion coefficient. Consequently, it becomes challenging for B atoms to spread towards Si along the Z-axis. Most of the displacement of B atoms occurs only inside the B source, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). However, with the increase of temperature, the diffusion coefficient of B continues to increase, and B atoms continue to diffuse into Si along the z axis, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), (c) and (d). The simulation results indicate: when the B source concentration in the Si paste remains constant, higher temperatures result in larger diffusion coefficients, leading to a greater influx of B atoms into the Si matrix and deeper diffusion depths, and the diffusion of Z-direction is dominant. However, when the temperature exceeds 950  ◦ C, the average diffusion depth and the maximum diffusion depth suddenly increase. Therefore, the most favorable results are tentatively obtained in the temperature range of 950–1050  ◦ C. 4.2.Experimental results B powder [12] can also serve as a doping source for n-type Si. However, creating high concentrations (more than 10 19  atom/cm 3 ) of pure B doping sources with low oxygen content is challenging [28]. Moreover, when using a pure B source in high-temperature diffusion processes (above 1000  ◦ C), the resulting B-doped layer tends to be nonuniform, adversely affecting the separation of photogenerated car - riers. In the methodology employed in this study, B atoms are distributed in two primary forms. One part exists as Si-B-O bonds within the silica of BSG, while the other part is deposited on the surface of Si nanoparticles in the form of B-B and B-O bonds. During high-temperature doping, B atoms effectively diffuse, and during the thermal annealing process, B atoms from both forms further penetrate into Si nanoparticles. This approach enhances the uniformity of the doping layer and significantly increases the doping rate of B atoms. Fig. 10 (a) and (b) depict the schematic representation of the pre - pared Si paste and the schematic layout of the Si wafer used for the square resistance test after screen printing. The screen printing process of the Si paste is substantiated by results from the contour measurement image obtained via laser microscopy and the scanning electron micro - scope image, as presented in Fig. 10 (c) and (d). The square area’s di - mensions, as shown in Fig. 10 (b), measure approximately 20 mm ×20 mm. The boundary of this region is well defined, with no extensions. Following the preparation of the pretreated wafer, Si paste is screen- printed onto the front surface opening to create a densely packed linear Si paste area, as illustrated in Fig. 10 (c). The cross-section of the Si paste region is depicted in Fig. 10 (d). After drying for approximately 30 s at 250  ◦ C, the dried Si paste attains a thickness of approximately 2   m. Furthermore, the scanning electron microscope image reveals that the Si paste thickness exhibits excellent uniformity within the square area. To determine the optimal diffusion time and temperature, the sheet resistance on the Si wafer was tested using the four-probe test method under various diffusion temperature and time conditions. This testing further confirms the B concentration on the Si wafer after thermal diffusion. Si wafers processed below 750  ◦ C were not investigated since insufficient heat treatment does not effectively facilitate B atom diffusion. As depicted in Fig. 11, the sheet resistance decreases as the thermal diffusion temperature and time increase. Specifically, at a given diffu - sion temperature, increasing the time results in a lower sheet resistance. Similarly, at a consistent diffusion time, elevating the temperature leads to decreased sheet resistance. This pattern indicates a gradual diffusion of B atoms into the Si wafer. At 850  ◦ C, the sheet resistance decreases rapidly initially, but as time progresses, the surface source concentration diminishes, and the sheet resistance stabilizes until reaching 1050  ◦ C. These findings align well with the simulation results presented in Fig. 6. As the temperature rises, the concentration of B atoms, or the doping concentration, increases, elevating the carrier concentration of the Si wafer and enhancing its conductivity, resulting in decreased sheet  Fig. 9.The trend of the diffusion coefficient with increasing temperature.

Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       resistance. Fig. 12 displays the B doping curve of the Si wafer after thermal diffusion for 60 min at different temperatures, measured using the ECV. Higher temperatures correspond to higher B doping concentrations and deeper junction depths. In the junction depth range of 0.09–0.12   m, the maximum doping concentrations at 750  � C, 850  � C, 950  � C, and 1050  � C are 8.23 �10 18  atom/cm 3 , 5.45 �10 19  atom/cm 3 , 4.32 �10 20  atom/ cm 3 , and 9.17 �10 20  atom/cm 3 , respectively. The experimental results in terms of doping concentration closely mirror the trends observed in Fig. 6. Combining the simulation results and doping performance, the optimal conditions for preparing the p � /n junction involve thermal diffusion at 950  � C for 20 min. After the removal of the BSG layer, the relationship between the B concentration and the depth of the p � layer and p � layer was estimated using ECV, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Within the junction depth range of 0.09–0.12   m, the maximum doping concentrations for the p � and p � layers are 8.68 �10 18  atom/cm3 and 2.35 �10 19  atom/cm 3 , respec - tively. The corresponding sheet resistances measure approximately 108.69 / and 83.12 /, respectively. The junction depths of the p � /n and p � /n junctions are 0.53   m and 0.82   m, respectively. These results highlight that the use of B-doped Si paste, coupled with an appropriate thermal diffusion process, can significantly enhance the performance of B doping. The temperature and duration of B diffusion have a significant effect on the fill factor (FF) of the cell. Precisely controlling the temperature and duration of B diffusion can ensure that B diffuses to the appropriate depth on the cell’s surface, thereby enhancing the FF [3,16,29,30]. Specifically, the temperature of B diffusion has an effect on the filling coefficient. Appropriate B diffusion temperature can promote the interfacial reaction between metal electrode and Si substrate, which contributes to the formation of low contact resistance. Secondly, the duration of B diffusion also affects the contact resistance between the metal electrode and the Si substrate. Appropriate B diffusion time can ensure that the interface between the metal electrode and the Si sub - strate forms a uniform and low contact resistance, which is conducive to the transport of electrons and the improvement of the filling coefficient. Additionally, selecting the appropriate B doping concentration is crucial for improving the cell’s FF. Excessive B doping concentration can result in an excessive surface dose and increased current loss in the cell. Conversely, a B doping concentration that is too low may not effectively enhance the FF. The high B surface doping concentration increases the contact resistance between the metal electrode and the Si substrate. In solar cells, the surface recombination rate refers to the speed of recombination of photogenerated carriers after reaching the surface. The higher surface recombination rate leads to an increase in the loss of photogenerated carriers. The increase of B doping concentration on the surface of the solar cell increases its recombination rate, resulting in more loss of photogenerated carriers when they reach the surface, thereby increasing the current loss in the solar cell. In addition, the high surface B doping concentration will also affect the electric field distri - bution on the surface of the solar cell, thus affecting the carrier transport and collection efficiency on these surfaces, resulting in an increase in current loss. To further substantiate the benefits of this specific process condition (screen-printed Si paste and thermal diffusion at 950  � C for 20 min), a comparison was conducted between the I-V data of TOPCon �cells fabricated using this process and TOPCon cells produced via the stan - dard production line procedure using the same batch of wafers. A summary of this comparative analysis is provided in Table 1. In general, TOPCon �cells with printed Si paste under appropriate thermal diffu - sion conditions exhibit higher efficiency than TOPCon cells without printed Si paste. This technology increases the efficiency of TOPCon cells on the normal production line by an average of approximately 0.12 % and up to 0.23 % in the most significant cases. A substantial portion of the improvement in cell efficiency can be attributed to a noteworthy  Fig. 11.Sheet resistance on Si substrate at different temperatures and different diffusion times.

Liu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       increase in the FF of TOPCon cells, reaching up to 0.41 %. This enhancement is primarily attributable to the use of appropriate thermal diffusion conditions and B-doped Si paste to improve the FF. SE structure has been reported to offer advantages such as reduced Auger recombination, decreased contact recombination, and lower contact resistivity [12,18,31,32]. When the B emitter is formed in the solar cell with reduced doping concentration, it results in diminished Auger recombination and improved solar cell characteristics, particu - larly the short circuit current density (J sc ) and FF. Voc is mainly affected by the doping concentration of bulk Si and pn junction(p�/n). However, in this study, the sheet resistivity of p�/n layer is 108.69 /, which is similar to standard process TOPCon cell(100–120 /). So the change of Voc is relatively small. The SE structure (p�/n) shows a greater impact on contact resistivity in this study, which affects the Jsc and FF more obviously. The improvement in FF observed in this study is mainly attributed to the use of screen-printed Si paste and the appropriate thermal diffusion process. These processes enhance the quality of the PN junction, create a uniform and effective B-doped layer on the Si wafer surface, and reduce defects on the PN junction surface. Additionally, this process reduces the series resistance in the PN junction region and minimizes current losses within the solar cell, thus improving the FF. It is important to note that this study has only conducted limited foundational research on B diffusion through molecular dynamics simulation. Further work is needed to develop and refine the theoretical model, optimize the thermal diffusion curve, and adjust the doping concentration of the B emitter. These efforts will contribute to further enhancing the performance of TOPCon cells. 5.Conclusions In this study, the atomic-level diffusion behavior of B-doped Si was elucidated through molecular dynamics methods. The diffusion char - acteristics of B in Si, dependent on temperature and time, were suc - cessfully identified. The simulation results reveal that only a limited number of B atoms diffuse into Si along the Z direction during the diffusion process. The quantity and depth of B atom diffusion are contingent on temperature and time, with higher temperatures resulting in more B atoms diffusing deeper into the material. The experimental results of thermal diffusion are consistent with the simulation findings. As the temperature increases, the sheet resistance decreases, and with higher doping concentrations, the junction depth increases. Considering the practical challenges and cost implications of the process, one-step B diffusion was carried out using BCl 3  and B-doped Si paste as the B source. The thermal diffusion process at 950  � C for 20 min was selected to achieve the desired p � /n and p � /n doping concentrations and connection depths, resulting in an efficient Topcon �cell. The maximum B doping concentrations for the p � and p � layers are 8.68 �10 18  atom/ cm 3  and 2.35 �10 19  atom/cm 3,  respectively. The connection depths of p � /n and p � /n are 0.53   m and 0.82   m, respectively. Ultimately, the I-V performance test demonstrated an efficiency improvement of 0.23 %, primarily attributable to the 0.41 % increase in the FF. This method has the potential to optimize the B diffusion curve and serves as a valuable tool for enhancing the conversion efficiency of Si-based solar cells.

The wires are attached to the SHJ cells via discrete pads of conductive paste, enabling direct current extraction from the indium tin oxide (ITO) layer and facilitating transport to sequentially connected cells. We describe the DWB fabrication process and demonstrate its potential by comparing its performance to that of traditional SHJ modules. Our test devices show that DWB modules achieve competitive efficiencies, 0.03 % abs. higher in experiments than the 0BB and multi-wire solutions—while significantly reducing material consumption. In the study we give an outlook on the possible improvement in efficiency. The economic analysis further demonstrates that DWB can reduce produc - tion costs to as low as 18 % of the cost of other SHJ metallization and interconnection techniques. These initial results suggest that DWB is a cost-effective solution that addresses both economic and material scarcity chal - lenges in the photovoltaic industry. 1.Introduction Amid the pressure of the climate crisis, nations worldwide have agreed to the Paris Accords [ 1 ] to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. As a promising renewable energy source, photovoltaic power is considered a viable alternative to traditional energy sources and is widely utilized in power plants. By 2023, global photovoltaic shipments reached approx - imately 400 GW, with PERC technology maintaining its dominance in the industry, as depicted in  Fig. 1 . Under the greenhouse gas emissions requirements of the Accords, the ITRPV predicts that annual photovol - taic production will reach terawatt level by 2030, resulting in the phase out of less efficient passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) technology in favor of the emerging tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and SHJ technologies [ 2 ]. However, this rapid growth and new cell tech - nologies could lead to shortages of raw materials for photovoltaics, potentially causing price fluctuations. Based on the current silver (Ag) usage for the new cell concepts, particularly for SHJ solar cells, it is predicted that the industry will consume about half of the annual silver supply once production reaches the terawatt era [ 3 ]. Besides silver, bismuth (Bi) as the key element in the low temperature solder particular for interconnection of SHJ solar cells is also a concern. Even if only SHJ solar cells adopt bismuth-based soldering in 2034, the photovoltaic in - dustry could consume about 25 % of the global annual bismuth supply in 2034, assuming a rate of 13 mg/W [ 3 , 4 ]. Therefore, reducing con - sumption of silver paste and rare elements for interconnection is crucial for the photovoltaic industry, particularly for SHJ solar cells. In the traditional SHJ photovoltaic production process, solar cells are initially metallized to laterally enhance current transport. Once elec - trical carriers accumulate at the busbars from fingers on the cell, they are collected via soldered copper wires or ribbons for the electrical transport to the next cell. This study explores the possibility of direct extraction of current from the ITO layer of SHJ solar cells using conductive paste applied in discrete pads, subsequently transported via thin, highly conductive copper wires. Additionally, the wires extending  * Corresponding author. IMD-3: Photovoltaics, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Wilhelm-Johnen Straße, 52425, Jülich, Germany. ** Corresponding author.

Therefore, this method has the potential to eliminate the need for low-temperature solder and minimize the use of silver. Maximizing the device’s power output is critical, necessitating careful design of the front electrode with wires and pads. We, therefore, model the module with Direct Wire Bonding (DWB) using PVMOS [ 6 ] and calculate the optimal pitch of pads and wires. To compare with another metallization scheme and analyze power dissipation, modules with wires interconnection at 0.828 cm pitch and ribbon interconnections at 1.65 cm pitch are simulated as references. Finally, the DWB module, optimized with specific parameters, demonstrates performance compa - rable to the reference method in the experiment. Since there is no requirement for optical shading in the metallization and interconnection on the rear side of solar cells, making implementation easier, this paper will exclusively focus on direct wire bonding (DWB) on the front side of solar cells and compare it to traditional metallization and interconnec - tion methods. 2.The fabrication of the device All solar cells used in the experiment are from the same batch of M2commercial metallization-free SHJ solar cells. Initially, the cells are screen-printed with a 0-busbar metallization layout featuring 250 fingers on the rear side. The cells are cut into 5 5 cm squares from the edge, leaving only three non-passivated edges leading to some efficiency losses. After attaching copper wires with a diameter of 30   m to both ends of the cell, silver coated copper paste is dispensed in tiny dots along the wires at a specified pitch by a dispensing robot. During dispensing, the cone-shaped nozzle with a 150   m opening is aligned with the wires, 50   m above the cell. Electrical loss and optical shading in the device are inversely affected by the wire diameter, wire pitch, and dot pitch, necessitating careful optimization of these variables by simulation, which will be detailed in the next section. After connecting six 250   m diameter copper (Cu) tabbing wires coated with low-temperature solder wires with a pitch of 8.28 mm for the back contact, the cell is laminated in a module in a size of 20 20cm at 150   C for 1060 s, during which the paste is annealed, as shown in  Fig. 3 (a). For comparison, the metallization-free M2SHJ solar cells are screen-printed with 96 fingers on the front side and 250 fingers in the same arrangement as DWB samples on the back. After cutting, six tab - bing wires the features described previously are bonded to both sides of the 5 5 cm cells, corresponding to 18 tabbing wires on an M2solar cell as depicted in  Fig. 3 (b). To mimic the common 9 busbars inter - connection layout on M2solar cells, three 1 mm wide Ag-coated Cu ribbons are attached to the printed busbars of the cut cells using elec - trically conductive adhesive dispensed in dots with a pitch of 1.65 cm shown in  Fig. 3 (c). 3.Device simulation and optimization Table 1 shows the contact and line resistances of metallization and interconnection as measured in the experiment. The line resistance of the Cu wire is about six times lower than that of an Ag finger, and 13 times lower than that of fingers from Ag-coated Cu paste, meeting the requirements for longer-distance current transport on cells and poten - tially substituting tabbing for the scale of cells in the experiment. In addition to line resistance for lateral current transport, vertical electrical loss at the contact points between wires and ITO is also critical. The Ag- coated Cu paste exhibits a slightly lower (3.35 m cm 2 ) contact resis - tance than the Ag paste used in the experiment. This is probably due to the 2.4%wt higher solid content or the particle size distribution in the Ag-coated Cu paste. Combining the benefits of Ag-coated Cu paste at the contact points with the lower line resistance of Cu wires, DWB is promising in achieving performance comparable to traditional metalli - zation and interconnection methods. The slight difference in contact resistance may be attributed to the different measurement structures used. Contact resistance of wires to ITO in DWB samples is measured using the Cross Bridge Kervin Resistor (CBKR) method, whereas the contact resistance of paste is characterized using the transmission line measurement (TLM) structure [ 7 ]. Since all devices are benchmarked against the performance of reference modules with six tabbing wires on each side in the experiment, simulating and optimizing the DWB structure requires accounting for the optical and cell conditions of the reference. Typically, our solar module without anti-reflection coating on the front glass can achieve 20.9 % module efficiency using the M2SHJ solar cell with 23.5 % efficiency, when measured with an aperture to prevent light collection from the surrounding white backsheet, resulting in a short circuit cur - rent (J sc ) of 36.06 mA/cm 2 . For this study, we cut the solar cells into 5 5 cm 2  pieces, resulting in a decrease in fill factor (FF)and open-circuit voltage (V oc ), leading to a reduction in average efficiency from 23.3 % to 22.5 %. The modules are measured using a 5 5 cm 2  aperture due to the aforementioned reasons, leading to a J sc  of 35.66 mA/cm 2  for the reference six-wire solar modules. The pads of the DWB device are printed using dispensing technology. The final dot dimensions are highly sensitive to the nozzle-to-surface gap, wire alignment (influenced by wire straightness and table levelness), and dispenser robot precision. This sensitivity leads to printed pads with varying shapes (ranging from circular to square) and sizes (200–300   m), as shown magnified in  Fig. 3 Fig. 1.The forecast of different cell technologies in the PV market and ship - ment is shown in a stacked area chart, with corresponding Ag consumption for PV (red line) and Bi consumption if all SHJ use Bi-based low-temperature solder (blue line) [ 2,3,5 ].

Because these variations are difficult to predict precisely, we modelled the dots as 300   m squares in our simulations to maintain simplicity and consistency. Simulated efficiency of the DWB module as a function of wire pitch and number of contact pads is illustrated in  Fig. 4 . The DWB method achieves a maximum efficiency of 20.19 % with a wire pitch of 1.4 mm and 34 contact pads per wire, compared to the reference module, which achieves 20.43 % efficiency in simulation with six tabbing wires on front side. Increasing the number of wires or contact pads enhances the fill factor, though it results in performance loss due to optical shading. Similarly,  Fig. 5 plots the maximum efficiency that optimized DWB modules can achieve with varying wire diameters.

However, when wire diameters are less than 40   m, device efficiency is significantly limited by wire conductivity, whereas the efficiency decrease from shading with diameters exceeding 40   m is less pronounced. 4.Experiment result and analysis Using the optimized parameters for DWB modules, the actual and simulated performance of modules with various metallization and interconnection methods was compared, as shown in  Fig. 6 . All solar modules in the experiment demonstrated efficiencies of approximately 20.5 % in  Fig. 6 (a) (the rather low efficiency is related to the light guiding effect of the glass when using relatively small solar cells). The DWB modules exhibited an average efficiency approximately 0.03 % abs higher than modules with six tabbing wires and 0.1 % abs higher than those with three tabbing ribbons on the front side. However, simulation results suggest that DWB modules should perform between the modules with six tabbing wires and 3 tabbing ribbons interconnection scheme. The discrepancy between simulation and experimental results is also evident in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) in  Fig. 6 (b), which follows the same trend. While the simulated Jsc for all devices is approximately 35 mA/cm 2 , the DWB modules achieved the highest experimental Jsc of 36.02 mA/cm 2 , which is 0.37 mA/cm 2  and 1.02 mA/ cm 2  higher than the modules with six tabbing wires and three tabbing ribbons, respectively. The underestimation of short-circuit current in the simulation can be attributed to two factors. First, the simulation did not account for light reflection caused by the reddish wires[ 8 ] and cone-shaped dots, as shown in  Fig. 3 (a). Secondly, as mentioned in the simulation section, some pads may be smaller than those in the model, likely leading to an overestimation of the shading effect of the dots. In addition, a difference of 0.7 mA/cm 2  in Jsc was observed in modules with three tabbing ribbons between experiment and simulation. It can be attributed to the surface structure which scatters the light of the 1 mm interconnection ribbons. In contrast, open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), depicted in  Fig. 6 (c) and (d), show close agreement between simulation and experiment. The Voc remained consistent from cell to module, with all modules measuring approximately 735 mV. As calculated by PVMOS, the primary limitation of the DWB device is its fill factor (FF), which is approximately 2.5 % absolute lower in simulation and 0.7 % absolute lower in experiments compared to the other two other schemes. This is attributed to the longer current transfer distance within the ITO layer to reach the contact dots, compared to other designs. Given further trade- off between current and ohmic loss is still possible in the DWB device, the use of a more conductive, but less transparent, ITO layer may be an effective strategy for performance enhancement. 5.Silver usage and cost analysis The weight of the paste used in the experiment is determined by measuring the volume of the metallization with a confocal microscope and multiplying by the density, then expressed in mg/W, based on the assumption of modules with 20 % efficiency. The usage of paste on the front side of modules in this study is illustrated in  Fig. 7 alongside the levels of different cell technologies in the industry. The paste applied in the 0BB layouts is close to that observed in industrial SHJ solar cells and marginally higher than PERC cells on the front side, which have the lowest Ag consumption. The busbars in the 3BB samples are dispensed with a greater thickness than is typical of industrial busbars. Conse - quently, the paste consumption in the 3BB samples is 3.7 mg/W higher than in 0BB solar cells. The weight per dot in the DWB sample is measured in the way about 0.002 mg, which corresponds to 4.25 mg/W, lower than in the 0BB layout, at 3.09 mg/W. Moreover, the Ag-coated Cu paste used in the DWB solar module contains 40 % copper, leading the silver usage in the DWB module is only 2.55 mg/W about one third of that in the 0BB module design. As this is the first demonstration of the concept, the amount of paste used in the DWB can be significantly reduced by employing smaller dots. Moving forward, if the dots are printed with a diameter of 150   m and a thickness of 15   m—achievable through screen printing or jet dispensing—the paste consumption could be reduced to 2.8 mg/Wp, and the mass of silver on the front side of the modules could drop to 1.7 mg/W. Assuming the paste usage on the front is about 58 % of the paste on the back as traditional SHJ metallization layout, total Ag usage could be reduced to 4.63 mg/W, meeting the in - termediate goal 5 mg/W for silver usage [ 3 , 9 ]. The material cost analysis of metallization and interconnection on the front side is shown in  Fig. 8 . PERC and TOPcon, as high-temperature solar cells, enable the use of traditional soldering processes. In contrast, the SHJ industry employs conductive gluing or low-temperature sol - dering processes, such as Smartwire interconnection. Since the Smart - wire used in the 0BB solar module is not commercially available due to patent issues, the cost data for interconnection in this experiment are from literature [ 9 ]. The wires in the DWB design can also be used for series interconnection of the solar cells; thus, the DWB costs include only the paste and Cu wires. The DWB benefits from using Ag-coated Cu paste, which costs about 350 euros/kg—approximately 44 % of the price  Fig. 4.Simulated efficiency of the DWB module varies across different wire pitches and numbers of contact pads. Under the optical conditions of the reference modules, the maximum module efficiency can reach 20.19 %. Fig. 5.Maximum efficiency of optimized DWB modules versus varying wire diameters. Y.

Solar � Energy � Materials � and � Solar � Cells � 282 � ������������ � 113412 � 4 � of conventional Ag paste. Moreover, the 30   m wires used in the DWB cost about 70 euros/kg, ten times less than Ag paste. Generally, the cost of SHJ solar modules is higher than that of TOPcon and PERC, due to higher Ag paste usage and more expensive interconnection methods. However, the DWB method avoids the cost of additional interconnections, which require costly bismuth or indium in low-temperature solder, or even larger amounts of silver (Ag) in elec - trically conductive adhesives (ECAs). Consequently, it achieves a cost that is up to 18 % of the cost of other SHJ interconnection solutions, at 0.30 euro cents/Wp. With projected improvements, the cost could decrease to 0.24 euro cents/Wp, making it even more cost-effective than  Fig. 6.a) The Efficiency b) Fill factor c) Short circuit current density and d) Open circuit voltage of modules using different metallization and interconnection methods measured with aperture.

The paste used in this structure is cured at low temperatures during the lamination process, making it suitable for SHJ and perovskite-Si tandem solar cells. As a proof of concept, we have achieved module efficiency higher than those of the 6-wire and 3-ribbon interconnection schemes on a 5 5 cm SHJ solar cell by optimizing the design through simulation. In terms of paste consumption, it is comparable to modules with the lowest usage 0BB solution. However, the DWB offers superior cost savings by eliminating the need for interconnect material. Looking ahead, the op - timum could shift in favor of DWB by using a TCO with higher con - ductivity or by minimizing the diameter of pads and correspondingly increasing their number and wires. Additionally, the cost of DWB could be further reduced by adopting printing techniques that thin the pads of paste. Moreover, since the paste in DWB primarily serves as the interface between the wires and ITO, using a less conductive paste, like carbon paste, that still maintains low contact resistance could be feasible, potentially further reducing costs. As this is an initial exploration of DWB, industrial-scale implementation remains to be fully explored. However, as the device is scaled up, the optimal wire thickness is ex - pected to increase to accommodate higher current flow. For stringing, we propose the following strategy: After wires are applied on both sides of the solar cells using screen printing or jet dispensing, the wires on both sides are individually connected to two thin metal ribbons at either end of the solar cell. The final stringing can be afterwards simply ach - ieved by overlapping and connecting these ribbons in series. This Direct Wire Bonding approach presents a promising pathway for cost reduction and performance enhancement in next-generation solar cell modules.

The double-sided TOPCon structure is composed of (p) poly-Si/SiO x /(n) c-Si/SiO x / (n) poly-Si, where the silicon oxide (SiO x ) layer is formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD). With a 0.6 �0.1 nm- thick SiO x  layer, an 18.8 %-efficiency solar cell is fabricated, where an excellent short circuit current above 39 mA/cm 2  is confirmed for a front grid structure. The solar cell performance is improved by optimizing the boron and hydrogen diffusion profiles near the p-side SiO x /c-Si interface.    1.Introduction The tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells gains much attention recently since it exhibits a high photoconversion efficiency over 25% with a relatively simple structure using front and rear ohmic contacts, easily transferable at industrial scale [1]. This TOPCon, also called poly-Si, SIPOS [2], or POLO-IBC [3, 4], is composed of a doped polycrystalline Si (poly-Si)/silicon oxide (SiO x ) stack. The thickness of the SiO x  layer should be below ~1.5 nm to allow the tunneling transport of photocarriers [5]. The ultrathin SiO x  layer is prepared by wet chemical oxide [5,6], dry oxide [3], or UV-O 3  [7], which yields an excellent passivation for the polished c-Si surface. However such passivation is strongly degraded for the textured surfaces [6,8]. Besides, the passivation is known to be weakened by the (p) poly-Si/SiO x  stack, compared with the (n) poly-Si/SiO x  stack for n-type Si wafer [8–18]. Therefore, the surface passivation of a textured c-Si wafer for the p-side is crucial for further development of high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells. Recent works already mention the use of front and rear TOPCon solar cells [6,12,15,19], some have only the front side textured used with the (n) stack [6,19]. The fabrication of TOPCon solar cell involves a high temperature (high-T) annealing about 850  � C, where the dopants diffuse from the doped poly-Si layer to the SiO x  interface creating a field effect passiv - ation and also inside the c-Si wafer generating a junction. The high-T annealing also induces the effusion of hydrogen from the SiO x /c-Si interface, and thus a hydrogenation step is necessary to terminate chemically the dangling bonds [5]. The dopant diffusion and hydrogenation phenomena are highly dependent on the SiO x  thickness, the dopant concentration in the poly-Si layer [20], the hydrogenation method, and the surface morphology, which complicate the process optimization of TOPCon solar cells. In this study, double-sided, front (p) and rear (n), TOPCon solar cells on textured wafer are presented. This structure consists of (p) poly-Si/ SiO x /(n) c-Si/SiO x /(n) poly-Si. The SiO x  layer is formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD), which yields excellent conformal coverage over the textured surface. The ALD technique also yields the thickness control of the SiO x  layer at atomic level [10]. Here, we particularly concentrate on the surface passivation of the p-side over the textured c-Si. The boron and hydrogen distributions near the (p) poly-Si/SiO x  stack are controlled by the boron doping rate in the precursor film of hydroge - nated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The solar cell characteristics are dis - cussed in term of boron and hydrogen distributions, measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). 2.Experimental 2.1.Wafer texturing and cleaning Floating zone (FZ) silicon wafers (n-type phosphorus-doped, 1–5 cm, 280   m-thick, 100- oriented, and polished double sides) are textured by KOH chemical etching at 80  � C for 15 min, removing about 10   m on front and rear surfaces cumulated [21]. Then, the wafers are cleaned by our standard cleaning process [22] to remove the native oxide and the impurities on surface. This process consists of (i) native  *Corresponding author. **Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: mickael.lozach@aist.go.jp (M. Lozac’h), s.nunomura@aist.go.jp (S. Nunomura).

Between each process, the cleaned wafers are transferred into a vacuum box to reduce the oxidation and contamina - tion. The H-termination surface of silicon wafer is stable up to 30 min under ambient air [23,24]. 2.2.Silicon oxide, a-Si:H deposition, and post annealing The ultrathin SiO x  layer is deposited by means of plasma assisted ALD (Oxford Instruments FlexAL® system). The deposition temperature is set at 300  � C for the full ALD process. The tris(dimethylamino)silane (3DMAS) precursor is used as a silicon source. An oxygen (O 2 ) plasma is used as an oxygen source, generated by an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) with 13.56 MHz radio frequency (RF) power of 250 W at an O 2  pressure of 15 mTorr for 3 s. The thicknesses are controlled by adjusting the number of ALD cycles and the sources exposure time (3DMAS and O 2  plasma). For polished surface wafers, the SiO x  thickness is monitored by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in situ using a Cauchy model. The c-Si wafers are then transferred into plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system in a down-flow configuration for the deposition of a-Si:H precursor films. Here, the p-type precursor film is composed of the (p)/(i) a-Si:H stack, where the boron concentration in (p) a-Si:H layer is varied. This (p)/(i) a-Si:H stack allows us to control the dopant concentration and distribution after the high-T annealing, as described in the next section. For the n-type poly-Si precursor, the phosphorous doped (n) a-Si:H is used without (i) a-Si:H layer. The p- and n-type a-Si:H are deposited at 140  � C with a mixture of SiH 4 , H 2  and B 2 H 6  flows, and SiH 4 , H 2  and PH 3  flows, respectively. The B 2 H 6  flow is changed in a range of 5–200 sccm to control the boron doping. The i- type a-Si:H is deposited at 165  � C with a mixture of SiH 4  and H 2  [25]. The thicknesses of these a-Si:H layers are determined from SE assuming a Tauc-Lorentz model. Next, the samples are annealed in a furnace at 820  � C for 1 h under vacuum condition. The temperature ramps are set as low as 100  � C/h for the annealing and the cooling down to prevent blistering effect on sur - face [26,27]. 2.3.Hydrogen plasma treatment During the high-T annealing step, the hydrogen atoms effuse from the material, resulting in a poor passivation property of the poly-Si/SiO x  stack [10]. Thus, a hydrogenation step is necessary to terminate the defects such as dangling bonds in the material [28]. In this study, the hydrogenation is performed by hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) in capacitively-coupled discharge at 300  � C for 1 min [29,30]. The pressure inside the chamber is set at 0.5 Torr, the power density at 60 mW/cm 2 , and the frequency at 85 MHz. The distance between the electrodes in a parallel-plate configuration is about 2 cm. 2.4.Characterization of the passivation The effective lifetime ( � eff ) of minority carriers, the implied open- circuit voltage (iV oc ), and the saturation current density (J 0 ), are measured on symmetric structures and non-symmetric structures on polished and textured c-Si surfaces. The passivation is characterized at room temperature by using the quasi-steady-state photoconductance method (QSSPC, Sinton WTC-120) [31]. The passivation property is evaluated by the effective lifetime of minority carriers at an injection level of 1 �10 15  cm �3 . A high  � eff  reflects a high-quality passivation. 2.5.Solar cell structures The solar cell structure fabricated in this study is Ag (3.6   m)/ITO (70 nm)/(p) poly-Si (22 �1 nm)/SiO x  (0.6 �0.1 nm)/(n) c-Si (~270   m)/SiO x  (0.6 �0.1 nm)/(n) poly-Si (22 �1 nm)/ITO (70 nm)/Ag (0.7   m), as shown in Fig. 2b. The cell size is ~1.0 �1.0 cm 2  over a 5.0 �5.0 cm 2  substrate wafer. As described in the introductory part, the (p) poly- Si/SiO x  stack plays an important role in the passivation property. So, the dopant concentration in (p) poly-Si is controlled by the precursor film of the (p)/(i) a-Si:H stack, where the boron concentration is changed, as described above. The double-sided TOPCon structure as deposited is (p) a-Si:H (2 �1 nm)/(i) a-Si:H (20 �1 nm)/SiO x  (0.6 �0.1 nm)/c-Si/SiO x  (0.6 �0.1 nm)/(n) a-Si:H (22 �1 nm). After high-T annealing at 820  � C, the (p)/(i) a-Si:H stack is converted to a single (p) poly-Si layer with the same thickness. The (p) poly-Si layer is about 22 nm to minimize the ITO sputtering damage [32]. Hereafter, we denoted the (p) and (n) poly- - Si/SiO x  stacks as (p) and (n) stacks, respectively. After high-T annealing and HPT steps, ITO films are deposited by sputtering technique at the front and rear surfaces as an anti-reflective and conductive coating. A low temperature post annealing step is widely used to recover from the ITO sputtering damage [12,33,34]. In this study, a low temperature post annealing is performed at 160  � C for 2 h. Then, the front and rear Ag contacts are deposited. The current-voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells are per - formed under the standard AM 1.5G (100 mW/cm 2 ) irradiance. The illuminated area, used for the measurement of the short-circuit current (J sc ) and thus the photoconversion efficiency, is measured at 1.045 cm 2 , which includes the active area (1.017 cm 2 ) and the grid shadowing (0.028 cm 2 ). The contact resistivity  � c  with the (p) poly-Si layer is measured by the transmission line method (TLM) on a specific front line patterned beside the solar cells from the same c-Si wafer. 3.Experimental results 3.1.Conformal coverage by ALD The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images in Fig. 1 present the principal advantage of the plasma assisted ALD technique: the conformal thicknesses of SiO x  deposited on both polished and textured surfaces are excellent with no thickness variation. Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b correspond to TEM images of (p) a-Si:H/SiO x  stack as-deposited and after thermal annealing at high-T, respectively, deposited on polished c- Si surfaces. For the samples on polished surfaces, the SiO x  layer is pre - pared using 3 ALD cycles with a source time exposure of 3 s corre - sponding to a thickness measured at 1.0 �0.1 nm. After high-T annealing, Fig. 1b underlines clearly the poly-crystalline (poly-Si) na - ture with some areas presenting well-organized atomic plans and some other areas remaining amorphous. Figs. 1c and d present the diffraction patterns of the poly-Si compared to the one of the bulk c-Si, the poly-Si does not present a clear organization such as the bulk, which confirms the “not completely” crystallized nature of the poly-Si layer [18]. Fig. 1e and Fig. 1f show the (p) stack after high-T annealing on textured c-Si surfaces. Here, the main advantage of the ALD technique is underlined with a uniform SiO x  layer even at the bottom of the textured valley (Fig. 1e). The magnification (Fig. 1f) underlines also a poly-Si nature with random and well-oriented atomic plans. For this specific sample, the SiO x  layer is prepared using 3 ALD cycles with a source time expo - sure of 10 s corresponding to a thickness measured at 2.4 �0.1 nm. The deposition conditions for the (p) a-Si:H layer are identical for the pol - ished and textured c-Si, which results in a well-known ~ 30% thinner layer for the textured samples. A top view of the textured sample is also presented that confirms the micron-sized pyramid texture (Fig. 1g). 3.2.Solar cells performance depending on the boron concentration Fig. 2a shows the solar cell characteristics as a function of the B 2 H 6  M. Lozac�h et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 flow during the deposition of the (p) a-Si:H precursor layer. For a B 2 H 6  flow between 50 sccm and 200 sccm, the V oc , the pseudo V oc  (pV oc ), and the implied V oc  (iV oc ) are almost constant about 638 mV, 650 mV and 655 mV, respectively. On the other hand, these parameters quickly dropped once the B 2 H 6  flow is reduced below 50 sccm, which is also observed in other work using trimethylboron (TMB) as dopant flow [35]. The short-circuit current J sc  is measured above 39 mA/cm 2  at any flow. The implied fill factor (iFF) is about 0.84 for a B 2 H 6  flow at 200  Fig. 1.TEM images of a) (p) a-Si:H/SiO x  on polished surface as deposited, b) (p) poly-Si/SiO x  on polished surface after high-T annealing.

M. Lozac�h et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 sccm, about 0.85 at 50 sccm, and drop quickly for lower flow, while the measured FF has a maximum about 0.71 at 50 sccm and drop for lower and higher flows. So, the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) displays a maximum at 17.8% for a B 2 H 6  flow at 50 sccm. The corresponding pseudo PCE (pPCE) reaches 20.8% under the optimized condition. The solar cell performance is improved by the insertion of an addi - tional DHF step of 30 s prior to the ITO sputtering, shown in Fig. 2a (star points). This DHF step is used to etch a possible oxide layer and/or defective layer at the surface of the poly-Si. The iFF and pFF are measured at 0.84 and 0.81, and the FF reaches 0.78. This yields an improvement of the PCE at 18.8% even if the pPCE decreases about 20.1% due to the iV oc , pV oc , and V oc  that slightly decrease about 645 mV, 630 mV, and 622 mV, respectively. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) are presented in Fig. 2c for the solar cells with B 2 H 6  flows at 5 sccm, 50 sccm, and 200 sccm. It is clearly shown that the EQE spectra exhibit an excellent response over a wide wavelength range from 400 nm to 1100 nm. For the EQE at 5 sccm, the short wavelength responses from 480 nm to 800 nm slightly de - creases compared to the optimized condition at 50 sccm. The EQE at 200 sccm is lower over a large spectral range from 480 nm up to 1050 nm compared to the optimized condition at 50 sccm. 3.3.SIMS analysis The depth profile of the boron (B) and the hydrogen (H) are analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). These depth profiles are presented after high-T and HPT steps. For comparison, two reference samples are prepared; one is the (p) a-Si:H (22 nm)/SiO x  stack as the “as- deposited” reference, and the other one is the (p) poly-Si (22 nm)/SiO x  stack as the “high-T annealed” reference, both without the (i) a-Si:H precursor layer. Fig. 3a presents the depth profiles of the boron concentration. The as- deposited (p) a-Si:H reference profile, denoted by the (p) a-Si:H (22 nm) curve, shows no boron diffusion into c-Si, where the boron concentra - tion is measured at 10 21  at/cm 3  for the first 22 nm and steeply decreases to 10 16  at/cm 3  at 40 nm depth. After high-T annealing and HPT, for the heavy doped (p) poly-Si (22 nm)/SiO x  reference, boron accumulates at the surface and at the SiO x  interface [13,15], with a peak at 2.8 �10 21  at/cm 3 , and the boron concentration diffused inside c-Si is measured about 2 �10 19  at/cm 3  with a junction depth about 150 nm, as shown by the (p) poly-Si (22 nm) curve. The insertion of (i) a-Si:H layer (20 nm) with a thin (p) a-Si:H layer (2 nm) for the formation of (p) poly-Si significantly decreases the boron accumulation at the interface with SiO x  and also the junction depth. Only the front stack precursors (p) a-Si: H (2 �1 nm)/(i) a-Si:H (20 �1 nm)/SiO x  (0.6 �0.1 nm) are used for the solar cell devices. For B 2 H 6  flows at 200 sccm, 50 sccm, and 5 sccm, the boron concentrations at SiO x  interface are measured at 1.8 �10 20  at/cm 3 , 1.3 �10 20  at/cm 3 , and 1.8 �10 19  at/cm 3 , respectively, with a junction depth about 120 nm, 100 nm, and 60 nm. It should be emphasized that a high concentration of boron is detected at the surface of the (p) poly-Si about 5 �10 21  at/cm 3  for the sample at 200 sccm. Fig. 3b shows the depth profiles of the H concentration. The peaks of H concentration, i.e., the H accumulation, appear for the as-deposited films at the surface and at the SiO x  interface about 10 22  at/cm 3 . Within the (p) a-Si:H film, H is measured about 8 �10 21  at/cm 3 . For all annealed and HPT samples, the remaining H is accumulated at the surface and at the SiO x  interface. The H concentration at the SiO x  interface decreases by one order of magnitude, showing about 1.2 �10 21  at/cm 3  - 2.0 �10 21  at/cm 3 , for these three cases. For the heavy doped (p) stack, the H concentration peak at SiO x  interface decreases by two orders of magnitude about 4.0 �10 20  at/cm 3 . Due to the effusion during the high-T annealing, the H concentration inside the (p) poly films is much lower: the H concentration is measured at 1 �10 20  at/cm 3 , 1.5 �10 20  at/cm 3 , and 4 �10 20  at/cm 3 , for (p) poly- Si using 200 sccm, 50 sccm, and 5 sccm, respectively, and at 4 �10 19  at/ cm 3 , one order of magnitude lower, for the heavy doped (p) poly-Si film. 4.Discussions The advantages of the ALD technique are well underlined in Fig. 1 with an excellent conformal SiO x  layer, even at the valleys of the tex - turization. Interestingly, we do not observe any pinhole in the TEM images, which can suggest a current flow via tunneling effect through the SiO x  layer [36]. Another advantage of the ALD technique concerns the precise control of the film thickness at atomic scale, which is necessary to reach a good passivation property. Indeed, we observe that an ultrathin SiO x  deposited with only one ALD cycle and a source exposure time below 10 s is necessary to reach  � eff  above 1 ms for (n) stack symmetric structure on textured surface. The solar cell characteristics present a clear dependency on the boron concentration with an optimum at 50 sccm, where the photoconversion efficiency is improved (Fig. 2a). For a B 2 H 6  flow lower than 50 sccm, the PCE decreases due to a voltage loss in V oc , pV oc , and iV oc . The pV oc  is consistently slightly lower than the iV oc , likely due to the additional passivation losses induced by the ITO and Ag sputtering processes required to finish the cell fabrication [37], and the measured V oc  of finished cells is lower than the pV oc  due to the series resistance effect [38]. The losses in iV oc , pV oc , and V oc  are attributed to the low boron concentration for the p-n junction [35]. As observed in Fig. 3a, the boron concentration profile inside the c-Si from the (p) stack at 5 sccm is below 6 �10 17  at/cm 3  with a junction depth about 70 nm. Such weak p-n junction is not sufficient for the Fermi level splitting resulting in poor  Fig. 3.SIMS profiles of a) the boron (B) concentration and b) the hydrogen (H) concentration for the front structures with different B 2 H 6  flows denoted (p) poly-Si 5 sccm, 50 sccm, and 200 sccm. For references, the heavy doped (p) a-Si:H as-deposited, and (p) poly-Si are also shown. The thickness of p-layer is 22 �1 nm for all.  M. Lozac�h et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 iV oc . Thus, a heavier doping concentration is necessary to increase the PCE. The optimum profile in our study for the (p) stack at 50 sccm has a boron concentration inside the c-Si about 5 �10 18  at/cm 3  and a junction depth about 100 nm. For B 2 H 6  flows stronger than 50 sccm, the PCE decreases due to the FF (Fig. 2a). Here also, the pseudo FF (pFF) is consistently slightly lower than the implied FF (iFF) because of the additional passivation losses induced by the ITO and Ag sputtering processes [37]. At 200 sccm, the FF strongly decreases to 0.53 while iFF and pFF remain at 0.84 and 0.81, respectively. This suggests a problem related to the series resistance, and thus the ohmic contacts. Regarding the depth profile of the B 2 H 6  flow at 200 sccm (Fig. 3a), a very high boron concentration at 5 �10 21  at/cm 3  is measured, higher that the limit of solubility into a silicon matrix [39], which can suggest the presence of a defective layer that can increase the series resistance. The FF of the fabricated solar cells are still relatively low at 0.71 for the optimized B 2 H 6  flow. Thus, a DHF of 30 s is performed prior to the ITO deposition to remove the possible defective layer. The solar cell property with DHF step underlines a clear improvement of the FF at 0.78 with an enhanced PCE at 18.8% (Fig. 2a). Transmission line measure - ments (TLM) for the front contact with (p) poly-Si layer shows a contact resistance  � c  at 3 cm 2  for solar cell structure without DHF step, and 0.9 cm 2  with DHF step. Thus, the DHF step is clearly beneficial to reduce  � c . It is worth noting that such DHF step may also decrease the iV oc , pV oc , and V oc  about 10 mV and consequently the pPCE is measured at 20.1%. The recombination current density prefactor J 0  for our best cells is measured at 298 fA/cm 2  by QSSPC at high injection level [40]. The PCE of 18.8% for double TOPCon-type solar cell structure on textured sur - faces is plotted in Fig. 4 from J. Melskens et al. [41], with  � c  as a function of J 0  from various c-Si solar cell concepts. The advantages of such structure is underlined with a high J sc  measured above 39 mA/cm 2  considering a front contact structure and the grid shadow, with the EQE showing excellent response at short and long wavelengths (Fig. 2c). Indeed, the EQE at short wavelengths at 500 nm is excellent compared to conventional heterojunction solar cells using a (p) a-Si:H layer [42]. The EQE at 5 sccm has a lower response from 480 nm to 800 nm than the optimized condition due to the weak junction, while the EQE at 200 sccm underlines a loss for broader spectra from 480 nm to 1050 nm due to a stronger parasitic absorption within the (p) poly-Si layer. Concerning the SIMS measurements, the boron is more soluble in the SiO x  than in the Si, making a concentration peak at the (p) poly-Si surface and at the SiO x  interface [43]. Interestingly, the insertion of a (i) layer is beneficial not only to decrease the diffusion profile of the boron dopant, but also to decrease the H effusion from the SiO x  interface and from the (p) poly-Si. Moreover, the H concentration inside the (p) poly-Si layers is decreasing with higher B 2 H 6  flow. The concentration of H remains one order of magnitude higher at SiO x  interface about 2.0 �10 21  at/cm 3  and inside the (p) poly-Si layer about 1.5 �10 20  at/cm 3  for the best condition, enhancing the implied open circuit iV oc  at 655 mV (Fig. 2a). It is known that the accumulation of H concentration at the SiO x  interface enables higher iV oc  values [44]. Other group also reported a hydrogen and deuterium accumulation at the SiO x  interface about the same order at 10 21  at/cm 3  at the SiO x  interface in (p) stack, with a H concentration within the (p) poly-Si layer about 10 21  at/cm 3  enabling an iV oc  about 712 mV on polished surface [45]. For the front and rear TOPCon-type structure on double side textured surface, a PCE of 21.4% seems achievable by increasing the amount of H within the (p) stack targeting a V oc  at 700 mV with measured J sc  at 39.2 mA/cm 2  and FF at 0.78. Furthermore, such structure uses only one high thermal annealing step with standard front and rear ohmic contact that could be easily transferable at industrial scale. 5.Summary The photovoltaic performances of a double-sided, front (p) and rear (n), TOPCon solar cell using textured wafer are presented. The ultrathin SiO x  layer is deposited by ALD to keep an excellent conformal thickness on textured surface. The photoconversion efficiency reaches 18.8% with a short circuit current above 39 mA/cm 2  for a front grid structure, and a fill factor at 0.78. An optimized boron concentration for the front (p) stack has been underlined with a boron concentration about 1.3 �10 20  at/cm 3  at the SiO x  interface and a junction depth about 100 nm by SIMS measurements. The boron diffusion is controlled by the precursor (p)/(i) a-Si:H stack. The H concentration at the SiO x /c-Si interface is a key to the Si surface passivation. For the 18.8% efficiency cell, it is about 2 �10 21  at/cm 3 , improving the implied open circuit to 655 mV. We underline that the use of higher B 2 H 6  flow presents a defective layer at the surface of the (p) stack generating series resistance. A DHF step prior to the ITO sputtering increases the fill factor to 0.78 by decreasing the contact resistance below 1 cm 2 .

A f ront - side paste   comprising   silver,  metallic  aluminum ,   and  inorganic   frit was  design ed   to contact  p +   boron - diffused   Si emitter   surface s   with SiN x :H - Al 2 O 3   antireflection - passivation layers .   A  rear - side paste   comprising  silver and  inorganic   frit was  designed to contact  n +   phosphorous - d iffused   Si   surface s   with tunnel - SiO x /n + poly - Si/SiN x :H   layers .   Solar cell electrical   data suggests efficiency is being limited  primarily  by the front - side metallization   paste .  The final front - side  meta llization   microstructure shows isolated metallic  aluminum   particles surrounded by  solidified  glass within the bulk sintered  silver   conductor line.   The  front - side  conductor  metal - p +   boron - diffused   Si   emitter  contact  region  shows  continuous   interfacial  film s   decorated with  silver   colloids   located  between the bulk  conductor metal and  Si   emitter   surface .   A microstructural model  suggests electrical contact for the front - side  contact region occurs  by a tunneling mechanism though the residual interfacial films.

I NTRODUCTION   Tunnel  o xide  p assivated  c ontacts  ( TOPCon )   cell  technology has become   the leading next - generation  choice   after  mono PERC.   Compared   to   technologies such as HJT and IBC,  TOPC on   architectures can be achieved by upgrading  current  industrial  PERC or PERT   manufacturing   line s which means a  lower capital  expenditure   is needed for existing PERC or PERT  manufacturers who  want to   upgrade their existing production  lines .   We investigated  n - type TOPCon  since n - type silicon  wafers have inherent advantages  over p - type   silicon  such as  higher minority carrier diffusion length   and less sensitivity to  metal impurities, and n - type cells don’t have boron - oxygen  (BO)   related light   induced   degradation (LID)   [ 1 - 3 ] .   A  TOPCon  structure   offers a gain in cell  efficiently   of ~1% absolute   compared to previous generation technologies   [ 4,5 ] .    I ndustrial  solar  cell manufactures utilize screen - printable  metallization pastes as a  cost - effective   metallization solution   because of their low cost, high throughput, and relatively high  performance .  Among   the challenges  for   introduc ing   a   TOPCon   architecture   to  industrial solar cell manufacturing  is utilizing  cost - effective screen - printable metallizations t hat   effectively  cont act both the front - side (FS)   and rear - side   (RS)   surfaces of  the solar cell  in a single metallization firing step  while   maintaining the benefits of the TOPCon architecture   [6] .   W e explore   both  F S and RS   state   of the art  screen - printable  metallization   pastes   on  an   industrial  n - type TOPCon  bifacial  structure   shown in  Fig.   1 .  It  has   a  FS   p +   boron   d iffused   emitter  and a  RS   n +   phosphorus diffused  passivating contact, with  screen - printed  conductor  finge r line s on both  the front and rear  sides to obtain bifaciality.    The challenge for  screen - printable pastes is to etch - through  the SiN x :H  and passivation layers on both the front and rear   sides   at the same time  during the  metalli zation  firing  process   to  make  electrical  contact with the underlaying semiconductor  surfaces  without damaging the contact regions   under the  metallization lines ,  which  can  increase the J 0   recombination  current density   and  reduce the   final solar cell V OC .   Electrical  c ontact is further made  complicated   by  oxide  passivation layers  on the FS (Al 2 O 3 ) and RS (SiO x ) which  are more difficult to  etch - through to establish contact.

Pastes were   roll milled to a   fineness of  grind (FOG) of  ~ 5   m m in accordance with ASTM Test Method D 1210 - 05.  P aste s   w ere   adjusted to a final viscosity between 200 and 450   Pa - s.  at  10   rpm.   Paste   solar cell   performance  was  evaluated on  commercially available industrial processed   bifacial  n - type  TOPCon  mono c - Si pseudo - square (156   mm   ��   156   mm)   random pyramid solar cells. The cell fabrication process  included alkali texturing, p +   boron diffusion (BBr 3 ), rear p +   removal (single side HF/HNO 3   etching), thermally deposited  SiO x   and intrinsic po ly - Si film s   (LPCVD), n +   phosphorus  diffusion (POCl 3 ), front n +   removal (single side etching), and  double sided SiN x :H (PECVD)   deposition . For the  metallization, a n industrial Baccini screen printer was used to  print front   and rear surface  five   busbar H - patter ned  conductor  lines. The fired  FS   conductor line mean width was ~ 30  �� a�d  height   was   ~1 5  �� . The fired RS line mean width was ~50  ��   and height   was   ~12   �� .  A n   industrial  9 - zone Despatch   furnace  was used to fire the screen - printed wafers.  The final screen - printed TOPCon cell configuration is shown in  Fig. 1 .    An industrial Berger I - V tester was used to measure  solar  cell efficiency (Eff), fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (V OC ),  shor t circuit current (I SC ) and series resistance (R S ).  E lectrical  data  values  are median   and standard deviation values for about  ten cells. Specific contact resistivity ( r c ) was measure using the  transfer length method (TLM)  [ 7 ]  on 1.0   cm wide strips cut  from   fired cells.  r c   values are median and standard deviation  values for fifty TLM measurements.   D G   values were determine  using F actSa g e ��   Microstructure   sample  preparation and  characterization was performed  on a  Auriga 60 CrossBeam  (FIB/FE - SEM) .   III.     R ESULTS AND  D ISCUSSION   A critical  challenge for the introduction of a  TOPCon   architecture  to industrial  scale solar cell  manufacturing   is the  implementation of  cost - effective   screen - printable  metallizations on both the front and rear side s   of the  TOPCon   solar cell.  Ea ch surface presents  unique   paste development  challenge s . The front  surface   requires   a past e   optimized for   contac t to   a p +   doped Si  surface, the rear surface  requires   a pas te   optimized for contact to a  n +   doped Si  sur face . Electrical contact  must  occur   with minimal  damage   to   the semiconductor surface  under the metallization lines.    A thick - film, screen - printable paste  typically  consists of an  organic phase, metallic silver particles, and an inorganic solid - state frit.   The  paste   is printed on the  wafer   surface   and   rapidly  fired at relatively high temperature ( � 780 � C).   During the firing  process the frit   forms a  liquid   phase flux that  helps   sinter the  silver particles to high  bulk  density and  etch es - through the  SiN x :H   antirefl ective coating ( ARC )   and passiva tion layers  to  allow   the  sintered  conductor line to  make electrical  contact   to  the underlaying  semiconductor   surface , ideally  without  damaging the surface. Sintering  the silver particles  to  high   density  reduces   conductor line  resistance   which r e du c es  solar  cell  R S .  Effecti ve  contact   to   the  semiconductor   surface  minimizes   the metal - semiconductor   contact   res is tance which  again  reduces   R S . Contact   to   the  underlaying   semiconductor  surface with out  damag e to   the surface  reduces   J 0   in the conta ct  region  which increases V OC .    S creen - printable   pastes  designed to  contact n +   surfaces  currently  contain   telluride - based  frits   [ 8 ] .  These pastes are  relatively   well established   as  FS   paste s   for p +   base  wafers with  n +   emitters . Paste s   designed  to  contact p +   surfaces are less well  established  and   contain  aluminum   metal  particle   additions   to  accomplish   contact ,   but   which  suffer  high  emitter damage and  relatively   high contact  resist ance   and conductor line resistance  c ompared to  pas t e s   for n +   surfaces.   Oxide s urface   passivation  layers (on both front and rear sides) further complicate  the  ability   for a paste to make effective  contact   to the underlaying  semiconductor   surface .    In this work  the   RS   paste, designed to  make electrical  contact  to  phosphorous doped   n +   Si  surf ace s , contained  silver   metal and  a  telluride - based frit.   Telluride - based frits form a  liquid phase flux during the firing process that oxidizes and  etches - through the SiN x :H ARC layer which allows the silver  conductor line to make electrical contact with t he underlaying  n +   surface [9].   The  F S   paste , designed to contact  boron doped  p +   Si  surfac es ,  contained  silver   metal,   a lead - silicate  based  frit ,   and  aluminum   (Al)  metal  particles .   Metallic  Al   is  required to  contact  p +   surface s .   The  Al   metal  is  thought   to  promote  electrical contact by  reacting   with and  penetrat ing into   the  p +   doped  Si surface  during the firing process   [ 10 ] .   The paste  must contain b oth frit and  Al   metal  for  good  contact. Paste  comprising   frit   sans Al metal or  comprising  Al metal   sans frit   were both tested and   result ed   i n   solar cells with  high  r C   and  poor  J V characteristics ( E ff   < 1%).    TABLE I   S CREEN - P RINTED  N - TOPC ON  C ELL  J V   D ATA     T able  I   lists  J V   data   for  n - TOPCon   bifacial  cell s   printed  with   front and rear - side metallization   pastes   showing median  and  ��est �e���   values   for the FS and RS of the cells.  The  bifacial  cell s   ha d   a FS median Eff   of   22. 19  � 0.10 %  and   a  maximum   Best Cell  Eff   of 22. 27 % , and a  R S median Eff of  18.27   � 0.18 %   and  maximum   Best Cell   Eff of 18.54 % .   The  median  bifaciality  Eff  factor  is   82 . 3 % according to the   ratio of  the RS illumination efficiency to the   F S  illumination   efficiency   (Eff - rear /Eff - front ) .   Since the front and rear sides have similar  V OC   and FF, the bifaciality  Eff  factor is  comparable   to the bifaciality   J SC   factor ( J SC - r ear /J SC - front   = 83.8 % ).   The FS ha d   a median  specific   contact resistivity ( r C )   of 2. 72   � 0. 38   m W - cm 2 .  This  value is   ~3x  higher   than  is   typically  achieved by  state - of - the - art  screen - printable pastes for contact to phosphorous doped  surfaces   [ 9 ]   indicating a need to improve FS  r C .   In addition  to   a  n eed to  improve   FS  r C , Al metal in the FS paste increases  conductor line  resistance and exacerbates emitter damage under  the metallization.   The electrical data suggest s   solar cell  Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Central Florida. Downloaded on June 12,2025 at 04:44:18 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Improvements in the base wafer quality can also improve cell  performance.    Fi g .   2  is an SEM  micrograph  of the  FS   contact region.  The  FS has  a  boron   doped  p +   emitter coated with an Al 2 O x   layer and  PECVD SiN x :H   ARC.   The   light contrast  area   (top portion) is  the  sintered  bulk silver conductor   metal  and   the dark  area   (bottom portion) is the bulk silicon emitter.   A n  interfac ial  (IF)  film   is observed  at the interfac e  between the  bulk silver  metal  and  silicon emitter.   During the  paste  firing process ,  the  inorganic frit  in the paste forms a   low viscosity   liquid   phase   which  migrates   to the silver - silicon interface region where it  enables the oxidation,  dissolution and removal of the SiN x :H  layer .  The  final  IF   film   is decorated with silver colloids  from  precipitation of silver  ions  dissolved in t he  IF  liquid phase   ac cording   to  the following   reaction :   Si 3 N (4 - x) H x   (solid)   + 6Ag 2 O   (IF liquid)   =  3SiO 2  (IF liquid)   + 12Ag   (solid) +  (2  -   0.5x)N 2 (gas)   + (0.5x)H 2 (gas) ,   D G  =  - 4 77   kcal .   It is not surprising to observe silver colloids along the interface  considering the large negative  D G   for this reaction .    Fig. 2. SEM cross section micrograph of the final fr ont - side  fire - through metallization interface region.   A   microst ruct ural model suggests  the silver   colloids   along  the  interface   participate in elect rical   contact  between the emitter  and bulk silver  by a tunneling mechanism   through the IF film  during cell op eration   [ 1 1 ] .   The   microscopy observation   show s   the   IF  film   to be   continuous   along the interface and  relatively  thick   with   no directed contact between the bulk silver and  emitter layer. If direct contact does occur, it is intermittent   and  spotty , and not within the observed area.   The SiN x :H and Al 2 O 3   layers appear to be dissolved/removed along the interface.    V oids , pockets o f  solidified liquid , and   a n isolated   metallic   Al   particle   are observed in the bulk silver .  The  alumin um   particle is surround by  solidified liquid   phase  decorated   with   silver colloids   that  form   during firing   according to  the  following  reaction   from silver dissolved in the liquid phase  frit .     4Al   (solid)   +   6Ag 2 O   (liquid)   =  2Al 2 O 3  (solid)  + 12Ag   (solid ) ,   D G  =  - 695 kca l .   It is not surprising to observe silver colloids surrounding  the  metallic  Al   particle   considering   the  large  negative  D G . The  isolated Al  metal  particle is not in contact with the surrounding  bulk  silver;   therefore,   i t   does not contribute to electrical  conduction and increases conductor line resistance   since it is  inherently less con d uctive tha n  Ag .  Metallic   Al   particles   and/or   Si - Al   eutectic   reaction products  are   not o bserved  directly  along  the interface   or in direct contact with the emitter  surface .  I f  these do   occur,   they are   sporadic   and  outside   the cross - sectional  view ing area,  or  they  may occur at firing temperatures  different  from  this study.  S ilver   crystallites   a re   not observed  along the  interface .    IV.     C ONCLUSIONS   In the development of an  industrial n - type  Topcon  solar  cell ,   cost - effective  fron t   and rear - side screen - printable  metallization  pastes  were investigated  resulting in a median  bifacial  cell  efficiency of  22.19  � 0.10%  and a maximum efficiency of  22 .27 % .  The bifacial  electrical  data  indicates   efficiency   is being  limited  primarily  by  the  FS metallization   paste .  The final  FS   metallization microstructure shows iso lated metallic aluminum  partic les surrounded by solidified glass within the bulk sintered  silver conductor line. The front - side conductor metal - p +   boron - diffused Si emitter contact region shows continuous interfacial  films decorated with silver colloids located between the bulk  silver  conductor metal and  silicon   emitter surface. A  microstructural model suggests electrical contact for the front - side  contact region occurs by a tunneling mechanism though the  residual interfacial films.   Future work will include a detailed  examination of the   RS contact region microstructure and an  analysis of the front and rear - side J 0   parameter s in the contact  regions .  Future paste development is focused on improving FS  metallization  pastes .   R EFERENCES   [1]   J. Benick, B. Hoex, M. C. M. Van De Sanden, W. M. M.

Further improving the quality of physical contact has become a focus of ongoing research. The film blistering issue has been identified as one of the major bottlenecks for the polysilicon (poly-Si) films deposited by the PECVD approach. In this study, we investigated how the in-situ phosphorus (P) doping level within the poly- Si films contributes to the occurrence of blistering. Our investigations into the film blistering mechanisms reveal that a high in-situ P-doping suppresses hydrogen release levels and reduces the accumulation of residual stress during annealing, which leads to the blistering-free appearance, especially observed in heavily P-doped poly-Si films. However, as excessive P-doping could weaken the interfacial passivation quality, we propose a bi-layer structure of P-doped poly-Si films which allows the doping profile to be tailored and maintain good quality passivating contacts. Based on the bi-layer structure, we fabricated industrial-sized tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells, which attained an average efficiency of 23.84%. Our work not only presents a promising strategy for improving the performance of passivating contacts via the PECVD approach but also underscores the significant potential for its widespread implementation in industrial TOPCon solar cell manufacturing.    1.Introduction Tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells have gained widespread acceptance among mainstream industrial solar cell manu - facturers owing to their passivating contact structure, which effectively reduces carrier recombination loss at the cell’s rear-side metal contact [1,2]. Typically, the superior surface and chemical passivation effects of the passivating contact structure in TOPCon cells are attributed to the presence of a heavily doped poly-Si layer and a very thin tunnel SiO x  layer (generally 1.4–1.5 nm), respectively [3,4], which results in low recombination current density (J 0 ) of <5 fA/cm 2  and low contact re - sistivity (  c ) of <10 m cm 2  [5,6]. Recently, fabricated TOPCon solar cells have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.8% on n-type c-Si [7], 26.0% on p-type c-Si [8], and 26.1% on IBC [9] solar cells. These values are close to the theoretical PCE of 28.7% calculated for a bi-facial TOPCon solar cell [10]. Poly-Si films can be fabricated by various methods, including plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) [11–15], low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) [16–19], atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) [20], hot-wire chemical vapor deposition  *Corresponding author.

Based on cost and perfor - mance considerations, the industry predominantly adopts two methods: PECVD and LPCVD. Presently, LPCVD edges out PECVD as the preferred method of choice in the industry due to the more mature technology of LPCVD. Nevertheless, in comparison to LPCVD, the PECVD method possesses desirable qualities such as higher thin film deposition rates, minimal wrap-around deposition, and reduced consumption of equipment-related consumables [26]. Consequently, tube-PECVD tech - nology, which is capable of integrating the tunnel SiO x  and in-situ doped poly-Si deposition processes, has significant potential for industrial mass-production of TOPCon solar cells [27]. Doped poly-Si deposited through PECVD followed by a thermal annealing process for crystallization presents an alternative route that detours drawbacks compared to the LPCVD approach. However, the a-Si film deposited by PECVD is susceptible to poor passivated contacts while the blistering phenomenon occurs in the film during the subsequent annealing process, both of which lead to a significant degradation in device performance [28]. The crystallization of a-Si films induces interfacial stress accumulation and rapid hydrogen (H) release, identi - fied as the primary contributors to the blistering phenomenon [29,30]. Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue. One com - mon strategy involves implementing slow thermal processing to grad - ually release hydrogen during annealing, thus preventing its excessive accumulation at the film/SiO x  interface [31]. Another strategy is to change either the temperature, reduce the H 2 /SiH 4  flow ratio, or use Ar instead of H 2  to control the film’s H content or porosity [31–34]. Additionally, modifying the surface topography and adjusting the poly-Si thickness have been identified as beneficial for suppressing blistering [35]. However, one of the most successful strategies in pre - venting blistering is to incorporate the elements of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) into the poly-Si film during deposition [36–39]. Lin et al. [36] investigated doping poly-Si film with C and attributed the reduced crystallization fraction of poly-Si along with the inhibited level of hydrogen release to the suppression of blistering. Similarly, Yang et al. [37] fabricated N-incorporated Si films without film blistering, also linking this to the reduction of poly-Si crystallization. Zhou et al. [38] studied O-incorporated Si films, achieving blistering-free films with moderate O doping. Finally, Sharma et al. [39] compared different PECVD-grown Si-rich amorphous films doped with adequate amounts of C, N, or O, and then demonstrated that the absence of blistering was due to the low intrinsic stress in the films. They concluded that O-incorpo - rated films were the most suitable for SiO x -based passivating contacts due to their high excess Si content and crystallization. Although incor - porating small molecule elements like C, N, and O can solve the issue of blistering, a side-effect of this doping causes the conductivity of the poly-Si film to decline, which greatly affects the electrical performance of the cells. Therefore, maintaining a blistering-free PECVD-grown poly-Si film while ensuring the performance of cells has become a focus of research on industrial TOPCon solar cell fabrication. In this work, we present a simple, effective, and industrially viable method utilizing the PECVD technique to implement in-situ P-doping poly-Si films, thereby addressing the concerns of blistering while also imparting high electrical conductivity within the poly-Si film as required by TOPCon solar cell applications. Investigations into blistering mech - anisms indicated that in-situ doped P could suppress hydrogen release levels and reduce residual stress during annealing, primarily accounting for the blistering-free appearance of P-doped poly-Si films. Furthermore, we propose a bi-layer structure of P-doped poly-Si, i.e., the inner layer adjacent to SiO x  is lightly P-doped and the remaining outer layer is heavily P-doped, with the goal of tailoring the doping profile within the poly-Si film, and further enhancing the passivation contact quality. Observations of surface morphology revealed the absence of blistering for the bi-layer structure of poly-Si film, with subsequent passivation and contact tests confirming the optimal performance. Finally, we fabricated industrial-sized TOPCon solar cells based on the bi-layer structure with 800 pieces of 182 ×182 mm 2  Si wafers, achieving an average efficiency of 23.84%, which is 0.26% higher than that of heavily P-doped poly-Si counterparts (23.58%). The results of this work un - derscore the tremendous potential of our developed in-situ P-doped PECVD poly-Si film with a bi-layer structure for the industrial manufacturing of high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells. 2.Experimental methods To evaluate the performance of P-doped poly-Si films, we fabricated the rear passivation layers on the industrial Czochralski (Cz) n-type silicon wafers with a size of 182 ×182 mm 2  (M10), thickness of 150 ±20   m, and resistivity of 0.3–2.1  cm. Appropriate characterizations were performed on the polished wafer to investigate the film’s perfor - mance. The polished wafer mentioned in this work was fabricated as follow: the n-Si substrate was first cleaned and textured, and then pol - ished by alkaline solution. The surface morphology of polished wafer used in our experiment was consistent with the actual rear-side of TOPCon on the production line, which made our work more practical and meaningful. 2.1.Fabrication of PECVD P-doped poly-Si films Fig. 1 illustrates the manufacturing process involved in fabricating the rear passivated contact structure for TOPCon solar cells. Before the deposition of the passivation layers, the polished wafer underwent RCA cleaning to eliminate contaminants. The tube-PECVD (ZR5000, Lead - micro) with a direct radio frequency (RF) plasma source operating at 40 kHz was used to sequentially deposit both the interfacial ultrathin SiO x  and in-situ P-doped a-Si. The deposition was conducted at 400  ◦ C with different precursor gases (SiO x : N 2 O; P-doped a-Si: PH 3 , SiH 4 , H 2 , respectively). In this work, to facilitate the comparison of the effect of different P-doping levels in poly-Si, the same thickness of SiO x  was used in all samples by fixing the SiO x  deposition time at 3 min. Different P- doping levels in a-Si were achieved by separately setting the flow rates of PH 3  at 0 sccm, 500 sccm, 2000 sccm, and 3500 sccm to obtain undoped, lightly doped, moderately doped, and heavily doped a-Si, respectively, corresponding to the respective sample groups of Baseline, G1, G2, and G3. The thickness of poly-Si for all groups was set to 140 nm. Following that, an annealing process was carried out under nitrogen (N 2 ) atmo - sphere (XH10000A, Leadmicro) at a temperature of 900  ◦ C for 45 min to transform a-Si to poly-Si and simultaneously activate the dopants. Lastly, a hydrogenation step was executed by depositing a 70 nm SiN x  capping layer via PECVD at 450  ◦ C (PD-405C, S.C.). 2.2.Fabrication of TOPCon cells To investigate the film’s performance at the device level, the manufacturing process of TOPCon cells underwent the following steps on the production line as shown in Fig. 2(b): (1) The n-type wafers were first saw-damage etched (SDE) in potassium hydroxide (KOH) then subjected to an alkaline texturing on both sides of the wafer, resulting in a pyramid size of ~2   m. After cleaning, boron diffusion was performed in a tube furnace using boron trichloride (BCl 3 ) as a dopant source to form a p +layer. Subsequently, an inline single-side etch (SSE) was performed to remove the wrap-around p +doping, and then the rear surface was polished by alkaline solution; (2) the SiO x  and in-situ phosphorus-doped a-Si: were deposited by the tube PECVD (ZR5000, LeadMicro); (3) the annealing process was carried out under N 2  atmo - sphere (XH10000A, Leadmicro) at the temperature of 900  ◦ C for 45 min, and the edge wrap-round deposition of poly-Si was removed with hot KOH solution; (4) the front side was capped by a 3 nm thickness of AlO x  with tube-ALD (Leadmicro) and the both sides were deposited a 70 nm thickness of SiN x  with tube-PECVD (PD-405C, S.C.) sequentially; (5) the electrode pattern was fabricated by screen printing (Softline-DL-SP, Maxwell) Ag–Al paste on the front and Ag paste on the rear, followed by  S. Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        belt-furnace firing (CFSeries, Despatch) to form the metal contacts and activate H atoms. 2.3.Characterizations X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD) was per - formed to investigate the effects of the different doping levels within poly-Si films on the chemical bonding states of the Si–P. The refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of different poly-Si films were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). X-ray diffraction (XRD, ARL Equinox 3500) was used to characterize the crystallographic phases of poly-Si with different doping levels. The surface morphology of the samples was investigated by optical microscope (OM, Leica DM 4000) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol JSM-7800F). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker Vertex 70) was used to analyze the chemical bonding in the deposited films. The active dopant was characterized by electrochemical capacitance-voltage profiling (ECV, WEP CVP21). Samples with symmetrical structures were prepared to investigate the effective minority carrier lifetime (  eff ), which was measured by a quasi-steady-state photo conductance method (Sinton Instruments WCT-120) at an injection density of 1 Θ10 15  cm �3 . The single-side J 0  was determined according to the high-injection method proposed by Kane and Swanson [40]:  1  eff � 1  Auger � 1  SRH � 2J 0 �N d � n�qn i W where   eff : the measured effective carrier lifetime of the sample,   Auger : the intrinsic Auger lifetime [41],   SRH : the defect-related Shock - ley-Read-Hall bulk lifetime, N d : the bulk doping concentration, n: the excess carrier density, q: the elementary charge, n i : the intrinsic carrier concentration, and W: the sample thickness. The contact resistivity (  c ) was measured by the transfer length method (TLM, Ai-shine). The elec - trical parameters of TOPCon solar cells were measured by Halm 3600 under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G spectrum, 25  δ C). 3.Results and discussion Examination of the changes in chemical bonding states is crucial for discussing dopant pile-up and redistribution in the near-surface region of the poly-Si films after annealing. In this study, XPS analysis was employed to investigate the chemical bonding states in poly-Si films with different P-doping levels. In Fig. 3(a), the XPS survey scans of poly- Si films revealed peaks corresponding to Si 2s, Si 2p, O 1s, and C 1s, which was consistent with previous reports [42]. Fig. 3(b) presents a magnified image of the binding energy range of 50–200 eV, where a closer view of the peaks in this region could be visualized. The P 2p peak position of ~129 eV as expected in the literature is indicated in the figure [42]. To explore the chemical characteristics of P 2p bonding in the P-doped films, we performed high-resolution XPS scans focusing on the P 2p core level region. For a quantitative analysis, curve fitting of the high-resolution P 2p spectra was performed using Gaussian-Lorentzian components after Shirley-type background subtraction. The fitted spectra were divided into three well-resolved contributions (plasmon loss peak of Si 2p, P 2p 1/2 , and P 2p 3/2 ) as depicted in Fig. 3(c)–(f). The broad peak located at 134.0 eV for all samples is primarily attributed to  Fig. 1.Fabrication process for n �poly-Si/SiO x /c-Si contacts, beginning with RCA cleaning and followed by PECVD deposition of tunneling oxide and P-doped a-Si, annealing, and hydrogenation.

Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        the plasmon loss peak of Si 2p photoelectrons, but could also have a minor contribution from P–O bonding [43]. The constituent peaks at binding energies of 129.9 and 129.0 eV are attributed to the P 2p 1/2  and P 2p 3/2  components of P bonded with Si, respectively [44,45]. These two corresponding peaks have an area ratio of 1:2, and the spin-orbit split - ting between them was 0.90–0.95 eV, with reasonable full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of less than 1.0 eV, which was in good accordance with the literature value of 0.99 eV [46]. Without P-doping in poly-Si (Fig. 3(c)), the corresponding P 2p 1/2  and P 2p 3/2  peaks did not appear, as the intensity of the single peak corresponding to Si–P bonding was not strong enough to be split into P 2p 1/2  and P 2p 3/2  peaks, consistent with previous findings [47]. As the P-doping concentration increased, the P 2p 1/2  and P 2p 3/2  peaks appeared and their intensities increased accordingly as expected. These results demonstrate that the P atoms are incorporated into the silicon lattices during PECVD in situ P-doping poly-Si. The experimental observations by XPS serve as clear evidence of the incorporation of P into Si lattices after PECVD in-situ doping and demonstrate the increase of Si–P bonds with the augmentation of the PH 3  flow rate. Due to the narrow band gaps and considerable absorption co - efficients of materials utilized in existing passivating contact structures, such as a-Si and poly-Si, significant parasitic absorption losses may be introduced compared to other c-Si/Si alloys with equivalent thickness but a larger band gap. These optical losses are particularly significant in poly-Si films, hence limiting their use in the passivating contact struc - ture. Therefore, the study of the optical loss of these films is very important as well. With the aid of spectroscopic ellipsometry, the refractive index (n) and optical extinction coefficient (k) of different groups of samples in the wavelength range of 300–1000 nm can be extracted, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. Since the poly-Si films are commonly used on the rear surface of TOPCon solar cells, their optical performance in the long wavelength range of 600–1000 nm is particularly critical. The long wavelength n and k values of Baseline and G1 had little difference, indicating that the lightly P-doped poly-Si did not significantly reduce the parasitic absorption of the film. When the doping concentration increased to the moderate level (G2), the  Fig. 3.(a) Full-range XPS spectra and (b) the magnified image of the P 2p core-level region for poly-Si films with different P-doping levels.

Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        corresponding n and k values increased at the long wavelength range, revealing that the parasitic absorption of the poly-Si film layer could decrease above a certain level of P-doping concentration. Compared to the G2 group, heavy P-doping (G3) could further reduce the parasitic absorption of the film. To further investigate the effect of P-doping on the optical absorption of the poly-Si film, we input the n and k values from ellipsometry into OPAL2 simulations to calculate the reduction in the current density ( J SC ) absorbed in the films, as shown in Fig. 4(c). For different P-doping concentrations, the parasitic absorptions in a device-relevant stack of air/poly-Si (140 nm)/c-Si on a textured wafer were computed. The equivalent  J SC  was then measured by integrating the product of absorption and photon flux (standard AM 1.5 G spectrum) within the wavelength range of 600–1000 nm. From this method, we obtained a potential total J SC  reduction of up to 5.11 mA/cm 2  (600–1000 nm) for the heavily P-doped poly-Si film (G3). The above results verified that when the P-doping concentration exceeds a certain level, the parasitic absorption of the poly-Si film starts to decrease. The XRD patterns of the films are presented in Fig. 4(d). Three main Si peaks are observed, corresponding to the orientations of (111), (220), and (311), respectively. The well-known reflections of the crystalline poly-Si film along the (111), (220), and (311) orientations were obtained at 2 =28.4 ◦ , 47.3 ◦ , and 56.2 ◦ , respectively [48–50], whereas the forbidden peak for Si (002) at 2 =33.1 ◦ was reported to arise due to multiple diffractions [51]. The XRD spectra clearly showed that the intensities of the main three diffraction peaks were simultaneously enhanced with the increase in the P-doping level in the poly-Si film. This result suggests that P-doping could increase the crystallinity of a-Si during annealing, which is related to the passivation effect of the poly-Si film. The issue of film blistering poses a significant challenge in the manufacturing of TOPCon devices, particularly when utilizing the PECVD method. It is widely recognized that the occurrence of blistering is primarily attributed to hydrogen-rich precursor gases and the condi - tions of deposition. The “hydrogenated"" a-Si thin film releases its hydrogen content of 10 20 ~10 22  cm �3  during high-temperature anneal - ing [29]. At the interface between a-Si and SiO x , a portion of the released hydrogen accumulates, ultimately leading to the formation of blisters. Additionally, the presence of a thin SiO x  layer between the Si substrate and poly-Si film in the passivating contact structure contributes to the poor adhesion of the SiO x  layer with the Si substrate or poly-Si film, resulting in the blistering phenomenon as observed on the polished c-Si surface. The underlying mechanism can be attributed to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between the SiO x  layer and poly-Si film, leading to the accumulation of residual stress after thermal annealing [32]. Due to the inhomogeneity of the film morphology and the elongation of the lateral transport channel, blisters form, signifi - cantly diminishing the TOPCon device performance [52]. In this study, the SiO x /poly-Si passivation layer was prepared on the rear side of the polished c-Si substrate with varying P-doping levels corresponding to the Baseline, G1, G2, and G3 samples. To examine the poly-Si surface morphology of the samples after annealing, OM and SEM were employed to observe the surfaces of the samples at magnifications of 800 ×and 1500 ×, respectively, as displayed in Fig. 5(a). From the images, it is evident that the surface of the Baseline sample exhibited severe film blistering after annealing. However, when poly-Si was lightly P-doped (G1), film blistering only appeared in localized areas. With a gradual increase in P-doping, film blistering on the poly-Si surface was no longer observed. These observations demonstrate that film blistering can be significantly suppressed by in-situ P-doping poly-Si via the tube  Fig. 4.Refractive index (a) and extinction coefficient (b) of samples extracted by spectroscopic ellipsometry as a function of wavelength.

This assessment is conducted for p-type silicon solar cells as they are intrinsically more resistant to radiation defects. By rigorously calibrating recombination parameters, radiation- induced defect profiles, and other pertinent details, a robust basis is established for an in-depth comparison of the performance characteristics displayed by both architectures under space conditions. The investigation reveals that when utilizing substrates with high doping levels, both PERC and TOPCon cells exhibit nearly identical beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-life (EOL) performance. However, with lower substrate doping concentra - tions, both technologies show improved BOL efficiency. Notably, this enhanced BOL efficiency does not translate into superior EOL efficiency. This distinction in EOL efficiency can be attributed to two primary factors triggered by radiation exposure. Firstly, the emergence of defects leads to a reduction in open-circuit voltage. Secondly, dopant compensation contributes to an increase in series resistance. Specifically, for PERC cells, the challenge of elevated series resistance is further exacerbated by the requirement for majority carriers to traverse both vertically and laterally to reach the rear metal contact. When a robust defect recovery mechanism or resilient cover glass is absent, substrates characterized by lower doping levels display increased susceptibility to the adverse effects of radiation-induced defects and the subsequent dopant compensation. Under these circum - stances, the TOPCon technology demonstrates a significant advantage over PERC, particularly for high electron fluence due to its full area contacts for both minority and majority charge carriers.    1.Introduction Solar cells play a vital role in enabling numerous space applications, including satellites, space probes, space stations, and planetary rovers. They provide long-lasting power for scientific experiments, communi - cation systems, propulsion, navigation, and other critical functions. Without solar cells, the feasibility and sustainability of space missions would be severely compromised. Only two photovoltaic technologies have been used beyond proof-of-principle testing for space power sup - ply. Triple-junction InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs solar cells have been used almost exclusively for space applications for the last 20 years. Prior to that, the USA and Europe utilized silicon solar cells to power spacecraft [1–3], while the Soviet Union pursued III-V photovoltaics from the outset [4]. The choice of solar cell technology depends on mission re - quirements, budget constraints, and specific performance criteria. Recently the increased popularity of short-duration space missions has led to a revival in interest in silicon based solar cells as the principal power source. This has re-opened the discussion on the relative merits at cell and array level of an inexpensive, low-efficiency technology over a more expensive, higher-efficiency technology [5]. Silicon solar cells, especially p-type silicon cells, have been extensively used in space missions for several decades and have a proven track record of success [6]. The current mainstream industrial crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell technology is the Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC). By inserting a dielectric layer between the substrate and the rear contact, PERC cells  *Corresponding author. E-mail address: b.hoex@unsw.edu.au (B.

The PERC technology has been widely adopted by manufacturers since 2017. PERC cells have undergone significant development in recent years, with a mass production average cell effi - ciency of 23.5 % in 2021 [7]. As the bulk lifetime of c-Si wafers has improved over time, the recombination of charge carriers at the cell surfaces and contacts has become a major obstacle to further enhancing cell efficiency. In this regard, the Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) technology has been proposed as a solution for the next-generation industrial high-efficiency silicon solar cells [8]. The TOPCon contact significantly reduces recombination losses for minority carriers while providing a low resistance for majority carriers. The TOPCon technology is also designed to be compatible with existing solar cell manufacturing lines, facilitating its rapid adoption by solar cell manufacturers. Both commercially available p-type PERC cells and n-type TOPCon (n-TOPCon) cells are readily accessible. While cost considerations play a pivotal role, it is equally vital to determine the most optimal technology concerning both beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-life (EOL) perfor - mance, particularly for space applications. In pursuit of this assessment, numerical simulations were conducted utilizing real-world industrial PERC and n-TOPCon cells as the basis. The recombination parameters were carefully calibrated per the measured performance characteristics of these cells under standard test conditions. To ensure a fair and equitable comparison between the two distinct technologies, the struc - ture of the n-TOPCon cell is systematically transformed into a p-type TOPCon (p-TOPCon) configuration, designed to possess comparable performance parameters. Afterwards an investigation into radiation- induced defects was undertaken, encompassing the replication of measured characteristics associated with p-type substrates from litera - ture sources. Employing precisely calibrated configurations, both cell architectures undergo comprehensive examination, incorporating various doping concentrations and a range of 1 MeV electron fluences. The results presented in this work are worst-case results as they do not take any bulk defect recovery mechanism into account, so their actual performance may be significantly better. 2.Simulation setup The Sentaurus TCAD software package [9] was utilized to perform comprehensive optical and electrical simulations on both the PERC and TOPCon solar cell structures. In the domain of optical simulations, the methodology involved the establishment of three-dimensional (3D) unit cells, characterized by a regular upright pyramid texture, within the simulation environment. Light trapping strategies were assessed through the implementation of the raytracing technique, encompassing considerations of both front antireflection coating (ARC) effects and rear diffuse reflection. The settings for the front ARC and rear diffuse reflection were determined by reflectivity measurements. Subsequently, the 3D distribution of absorbed photons, following calibration, was transformed into a one-dimensional (1D) optical generation profile, a format suitable for utilization in subsequent two-dimensional (2D) electrical simulations. To ensure accurate predictions, state-of-the-art models were employed during the electrical simulation phase [10]. A summary of typical settings, encompassing the modelling of fixed charge density and intrinsic surface recombination velocity (SRV) across diverse dielectric passivation schemes, is presented in Table 1. Moreover, the tunnel oxide was set to 1.2 nm and the electron and hole tunnelling masses were set as 0.42 m 0  and 0.33 m 0  [11], respectively, with m 0  signifying the rest mass of a free electron. The parameters governing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination [12] were meticulously calibrated to replicate the measured characteristics of commercially available PERC and TOPCon cells under standard test conditions. Given the level of front and rear passivation for current solar cell architectures, the efficiency potential for p-type solar cells is commonly constrained by the bulk minority carrier lifetime. This is particularly relevant for boron-doped substrates, where the interplay of boron and oxygen concentrations imposes an upper boundary on the minority carrier lifetime. This upper limit emerges due to the prevalence of the boron-oxygen (BO) defect complex [13], whose characteristics govern this restriction. Notably, the electron lifetime (  n0 ) was observed to exhibit an empirical dependency on boron concentration (N A ) and ox - ygen interstitial concentration (O i ), with the relationship articulated as follows:   n0 =7.675×10 39 N �0.824A O �1.748i (1) The capture cross section for electrons is estimated to be tenfold that of holes. Consequently, the hole lifetime (  p0 ) is ten times   n0 . The BO defects were eventually brought under control, and a viable avenue for their permanent deactivation was established via carrier injection at elevated temperatures [14]. As an alternative, the utilization of gallium (Ga) doping for p-type substrates emerged as a viable strategy to circumvent BO defects [15]. In the absence of BO defects, the maximum achievable lifetimes were found to be mainly dependent on the sub - strate’s doping concentration [16]. Under the circumstance where the excess carrier density (n) equals 10 % of the hole concentration (p 0 ), the bulk lifetime (  b ) within a p-type substrate can be described through the following empirical parameterization [16]:  1  b = 15500  s+ p 20 5×10 35 cm �6  s(2) The bulk lifetime depends on the interplay of SRH, Auger, and radiative recombination mechanisms within the substrate. Following the successful permanent deactivation of BO defects, the manifestation of SRH recombination can be effectively captured through the modelling of a mid-bandgap defect, characterized by an electron-to-hole capture cross-section ratio of 12. This relationship implies that   p0  is twelve times higher than   n0 . The representation of the SRH lifetime (  SRH ) can be simplified, as described in Ref. [17], in the following manner:   SRH =  n0 +  p0 nn+N A (3) At an injection level of 10 % of the hole concentration, Equation (3) can be further simplified to   SRH = 23  p0 132(4) From the relationship between   SRH  and   b , the hole lifetime can be determined as  1  p0 = 23132  SRH = 23132( 1  b � 1  Aug � 1  Rad )(5)  where the Auger lifetime (  Aug ) can be evaluated employing the Richter parameterization [18], whereas the radiative lifetime (  Rad ) is inter - connected with the radiative recombination coefficient of 4.73 ×10 �15  cm 3 /s. Table 2 provides a comprehensive compilation of the parameters for varying boron concentrations ranging from 10 14  to 10 16  cm �3 , after the achievement of permanent BO recovery at a temperature of 25  ◦ C.

Solar cells deployed in low Earth orbit (LEO) are exposed to an array of environmental factors. Among these, a prominent factor is the continuous barrage of high-energy particles, primarily encompassing electrons ranging from 40 keV to 7 MeV and protons spanning from 100 keV to 400 MeV [20]. The slowing of these particles within the active semiconductor creates displacement damage and hence the generation of point defects. This computational study considers the detrimental consequences of high-energy particle irradiation on p-type silicon solar cells. 1 MeV electron irradiation was considered since damage is rela - tively uniform throughout the thickness of the solar cell device and it is also one of the standard energies for which detailed characterization are performed. Particularly, defects under 1 MeV electron irradiation were characterized by Yamaguchi et al. through deep-level transient spec - troscopy (DLTS) measurements [21], revealing the presence of two donor defects and three acceptor defects. The energy levels and capture cross-sections associated with these defects were directly adopted within simulations as listed in Table 3. Additionally, the introduction rate of each defect was rigorously calibrated by modelling a 50   m space cell [3]. A simplified modelling approach for the back-surface field and reflector (BSFR) structure was adopted as described in Ref. [22]. The specification of introduction rates and defect profiles was achieved through the process of reproducing spectral response and short-circuit current density J sc , as a function of electron fluence. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Modelling PERC solar cells A comprehensive suite of characterization techniques, encompassing reflectivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE), and light current density voltage (LJV) measurements, was conducted across a dataset comprising over 20 M4 size PERC solar cells, featuring five busbars and 106 front fingers. The results from a representative PERC cell were employed for subsequent modelling. Due to the inherent symmetry of solar cell structures, the optical simulation unit cell was reduced to a 3D domain, encompassing just one-quarter of a pyramid. Furthermore, for electrical simulations, the unit cell was further simplified into a 2D domain, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The optical simulation phase was initiated with the aim of accurately replicating the reflectivity curve, thereby facilitating the determination of photon absorption within the solar cell. Through in-depth analysis of reflectivity data spanning the range of 400–1000 nm, the ARC layer, comprised of hydrogenated sili - con nitride (SiN x :H), was found to have an optimal thickness of 80 nm with a refractive index of 1.99 at a wavelength of 600 nm. Furthermore, by leveraging reflectivity data from 1000 to 1200 nm, the diffuse reflection emanating from the rear surface was effectively characterized using a Phong factor of 50 and an associated broadband reflectivity of 96 %, which is consistent with reference [23]. Electrical simulations were systematically conducted to replicate the EQE and LJV curves of the measured solar cell, utilizing the photo - generation profile derived from the earlier optical simulations. The substrate’s resistivity was determined to be approximately 1 cm. In alignment with the parameters established in Ref. [24], the profiles for the front emitter and the rear local BSF were conservatively set at 107 /sq and 10 /sq, respectively. Detailed specifications for the dielectric passivation on both the front and rear sides can be referenced from Table 1. From the EQE data presented in Fig. 1(b)–a front-side metal fraction of 3.79 % was established, which in turn accurately reproduced the measured J sc . In the pursuit of replicating the measured open-circuit voltage V oc , it became evident that a hole lifetime of 1.86 ms for the substrate was required, a value notably lower than the 9.51 ms calcu - lated in Table 2 after complete BO deactivation, likely resulting from residual SRH bulk defects. 3.2.Modelling TOPCon solar cells Similarly, the method employed in the preceding analysis was extended to a representative n-TOPCon solar cell. In this context, 3D optical simulations were conducted, considering a front structure characterized by a regular upright pyramidal configuration and a rear surface modelled using a Phong factor of 15 coupled with a broadband reflectivity of 88 %. Within the ARC stack, the optimal thickness for SiN x :H was determined to be 80 nm, with a refractive index of 1.96 at a wavelength of 600 nm in combination with a hydrogenated aluminium oxide (AlO x :H) with a thickness of 10 nm, as determined through a detailed analysis of reflectivity data spanning the range of 400–1000 nm as shown in Fig. 2(b). For the subsequent electrical simulations, a 2D unit cell, depicted in Fig. 2(a), was employed. The n-type substrate was found to have a resistivity of approximating 1.3 cm. The front boron emitter profile was set at 88 /sq. The experimental phosphorus diffu - sion profile within the n + poly region was characterized using the electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) technique and the thickness was found to be 220 nm. By effectively reproducing the EQE results as depicted in Fig. 2(b), alongside the corresponding LJV curves, the appropriate front metal fraction was determined to be 3.4 %. Further - more, to replicate the measured V oc , a hole carrier lifetime of 2.23 ms was found for the substrate. P-type silicon solar cells have demonstrated enhanced resilience to radiation when compared to those fabricated on n-type substrates [2] and this explains their dominance in early space missions as well as for terrestrial solar cells. In order to establish an equitable comparison against the PERC structure, the configuration of the n-TOPCon cell shown in Fig. 2(a) underwent slight modifications to transform it into a TOPCon configuration on a p-type substrate, as depicted in Fig. 3(a).

The metal fraction remained con - stant at 3.4 %. Parameters such as substrate resistivity and SRH lifetimes were aligned with the values for PERC. On the rear side, the boron concentration within the p + poly region was set to 6 ×10 19  cm �3  and the in-diffusion profile followed a Gaussian distribution as in Ref. [25]. The resulting sheet resistance was 76 /sq, the same as phosphorus doped poly. Subsequent electrical simulations were carried out  Fig. 1.(A) sketch of 2D unit cell of the PERC cell and (b) reasonable agreements between measured EQE and R curves and simulated results.

Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    following these adaptations, revealing that the p-TOPCon performance exhibited similarity to its n-TOPCon counterpart, as indicated by the LJV outcomes illustrated in Fig. 3(b). The observed 8 mV reduction in V oc  was attributed to a substantially lower minority carrier lifetime in p-type vs n-type silicon. The measured and simulated figure of merits are listed in Table 4 for both PERC and TOPCon cells. 3.3.Higher bulk lifetime Both the PERC as well as the TOPCon structures hold the potential for high efficiencies. As deduced from the preceding two sections, the pre - vailing loss mechanism in both cell types stems from SRH recombination in the bulk. Subsequent elimination of BO defects led to a quintupling of the electron lifetime, a value that can be further increased by increasing the substrate resistivity, as outlined in Table 2. Advances in technology have ushered in cost-effective Ga-doped substrates devoid of the BO defect. It may be reasonably assumed that Ga-doped substrates boast identical bulk lifetimes to their B-doped counterparts, post-permanent BO deactivation. Higher substrate lifetimes facilitate superior performance at BOL conditions. Concurrently, intrinsic recombination losses diminish as substrate resistivity decreases, leading to higher efficiencies. However, it’s imperative to optimize the finger pitch to keep the series resistance sufficiently low. To conveniently gauge the influence of enhanced SRH lifetimes coupled with lower doping concentrations across both archi - tectures, Suns-V oc  simulations were undertaken, thereby mitigating the influence of series resistance. As evident from Fig. 4, initial limitations in both PERC and p-TOPCon cells stemmed from BO defects, suggesting the potential for efficiency enhancements through improved bulk minority carrier lifetimes. With an electron lifetime increased by fivefold post BO deactivation, the pseudo efficiency increased by 0.7 % absolute for both PERC and p-TOPCon. This incremental trend persisted for J sc , V oc  and FF as substrate resistivity increased, aligning with expectations. At a doping concentration of 10 14  cm �3 , a pseudo efficiency increase of 1 % absolute was observed for both PERC and p-TOPCon configurations. 3.4.Radiation-induced defects Solar cells deployed in space are subject to degradation induced by high energy particles from the solar wind, comprising primarily protons and electrons of varying energy levels. The displacement damage dose (DDD) methodology, pioneered by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) [26], is well suited to the analysis of silicon solar cells since the Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) for silicon is well known, allowing the full radiation response of a solar cell to be determined for both protons and electrons to be made from measurements of one proton energy and two electron energies [27]. Assumptions regarding uniform defects triggered by 1 MeV electrons, and the identification of five such defects has been derived from DLTS measurements [21]. Building upon the simulation methodology applied to the PERC and n-TOPCon architectures, a 2D unit cell configuration representative of the 50   m back surface field region (BSFR) space cell [28], illustrated in Fig. 5(a), was established within the simulation environment. Following the simulation approach by Hamache et al. [22], the current study also embraced a simplified approach. On the front side, the emitter was characterized by a constant doping concentration of 10 19  cm �3 , accompanied by a junction depth of 150 nm. The rear BSF layer main - tains a constant doping level of 5 ×10 18  cm �3 , with a junction depth extending to 550 nm. The substrate, doped with boron, exhibited a concentration of 10 15  cm �3 . A substrate lifetime of 30   s was stipulated as reference [22]. The dielectric passivated front side was modelled incorporating a SRV of 10,000 cm/s, complemented by a zero fixed charge density. The solar cell in question exhibits exceptional internal quantum ef - ficiency, surpassing 95 %. Analysis of the BOL EQE, as displayed in Fig. 5 (b) [3], indicates that the optical characteristics of the cell are instru - mental in reproducing the EQE profile. However, detailed insights into the light management strategy for this particular cell are somewhat limited. An exploration of the TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3  ARC stack through optical simulations suggests that the front side of the cell was not planar; otherwise, achieving a J sc  of 40 mA/cm 2  would be unattainable. Yet, it is very likely that the front surface was partially planar and partially textured with inverted pyramidal structures as indicated in Ref. [29]. From a design standpoint for space applications, adopting a fully textured front surface may lead to higher in-orbit operating tempera - tures, potentially counteracting the optical benefits derived from light trapping. This presents a supplementary uncertainty concerning the texture ratio. The distinctive concave trend observed in the EQE data between 400 and 800 nm is likely linked to the ARC stack. A decline in EQE response beyond 800 nm suggests limited photon absorption (associated with high photon rejection) for longer wavelengths. This behaviour aligns with the design of BSFR, which effectively reflects longer-wavelength photons back into space. The absence of critical information about the light trapping strategy hampers the ability to achieve a precise alignment with the BOL EQE. Additionally, the shape of the BOL EQE influences the EQE profile following an electron fluence of 4 ×10 16  cm �2 . By fine-tuning the introduction rates of the five identified defects, it was established that the introduction rate of the donor defect positioned 0.18 eV below the conduction band (E c ) needed to be an order of magnitude higher than that of the acceptor defect located 0.18 eV above the valence band (E v ). Furthermore, it became evident that there was no constant introduction rate capable of yielding consistent agreement across all EQE curves for varying electron fluences. Usually, the defect generation profile is assumed to be uniform in the substrate after electron irradiation. However, it was found that a uniform defect generation profile failed to yield satisfactory alignment with EQE values between 800 and 1000 nm for the solar cell that was exposed to a 1 MeV electron fluence of 5 ×10 16  cm �2 . This discrepancy implies that fewer defects were generated on the rear side, which is justified as electrons gradually lose their energy in the substrate. A plausible supposition is that defect generation followed an exponential decay from the front to the rear side. With this assumption, favourable concordance with all EQE results was achieved, as depicted in Fig. 6(a). The depth factor characterizing the exponential function was estimated to be approximately 960   m. Given this relatively large depth factor, the defect density at a depth of 50   m is only 5 % lower than that at the front surface. This finding aligns with the conventional assumption of a uniform defect distribution throughout the substrate. It is important to note that consistent introduction rates capable of reconciling all EQE curves for different electron fluences remained elusive, hinting at significant sample-to-sample variations. By manipu - lating the front metal fraction, the simulated cell achieved the same J sc  of 40 mA/cm 2 , V oc  of 605 mV, fill factor (FF) of 78, efficiency of 14 % under 25  ◦ C and AM0 conditions. Through careful adjustments of the introduction rates, the observed abnormal J sc  behaviour was success - fully reproduced, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). Table 5 lists the carrier capture cross section values (  ) and intro - duction rates (  ) from previous publications together with the values used in this work. These values have discrepancies even from the same authors.

Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    degradation behaviour as well as EQE curves [3]. However, they did not reveal their approach and the relevant details. Hamache et al. simulated the J sc  degradation with all the traps and found it was necessary to in - crease the uniform introduction rate of the donor trap (�0.20) to 0.04 cm �1  [22]. Neither did they reproduce EQE curves, nor did they adjust introduction rates of the rest traps to fit the J sc  degradation data. In this work, capture cross section values from DLTS measurements [21] were adopted while all introduction rates were treated as fitting variables. As explained earlier, it was necessary to assume a nonuniform introduction of traps, which was modelled using an exponential decay function with a depth factor of 960   m and the introduction rates in Table 5 were calculated from the front surface. The introduction rates of deep traps (+0.56, �0.71) were reduced considerably as they have high effects on SRH recombination.

It is noteworthy that these two cells displayed comparable temperature coefficients, namely 0.349 %/ ◦ C for PERC and 0.344 %/ ◦ C for p-TOPCon. The investigation into the impact of space irradiation encompassed the incorporation of five exponential decay defect profiles, as shown in Section D, into the substrate. This integration maintained the original SRH lifetimes without BO defects. The intro - duction rates for these five defects were kept constant, ensuring a linear scaling of defect densities with electron fluence. The resultant perfor - mance characteristics, following exposure to various fluence levels during 1 MeV electron irradiation, were normalized with respect to their BOL counterparts. Illustrated in Fig. 7, a gradual degradation in all performance characteristics was observed with increasing electron flu - ence. Notably, deviations from expected behaviour in J sc  were absent due to the substantial substrate doping levels. As discussed in Section D, a fluence exceeding 10 17  cm �2  was required to induce significant ma - jority carrier removal and even substrate inversion. Within the investi - gated fluence range, both cell configurations demonstrated nearly identical patterns of performance degradation. As explained in Section C, both TOPCon and PERC can enhance their BOL performance by adopting lowly doped substrates with optimized pitch. It is of notable interest to investigate whether the utilization of lightly doped substrates could also translate into improved EOL per - formance. To this end, the acceptor concentration within the substrate was varied from 10 14  to 10 16  cm �3  for both configurations. Three discrete electron fluence levels, namely 1 ×10 14 , 5 ×10 14  and 1 ×10 15  cm �2 , were examined. Within an LEO environment, these fluence values correspond approximately to anticipated operational periods of around one, five, and ten years, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 8, the EOL efficiency of both cell types exhibited a marked reduction with decreasing substrate acceptor doping levels, with the effect being more pronounced in the case of the PERC architecture. Notably, the variation in EOL J sc , although not shown, exhibited marginal increments with increasing substrate resistivity, thereby discounting its contribution to the observed EOL efficiency trends. The pivotal factors responsible for the observed EOL efficiency behaviour were narrowed down to the EOL V oc  and FF. Evidently, the V oc  response of the PERC cell shown in Fig. 9(a) exhibited similarity to that of the p-TOPCon cell depicted in Fig. 9(b) concerning the effects of substrate doping and electron fluence. How - ever, the PERC cell displayed a more pronounced decline in FF compared to the p-TOPCon cell for lightly doped substrates. These behaviours can be attributed to the creation of SRH defects and the removal of majority carriers, as discussed in Section D. The former primarily governs vari - ations in V oc , while the latter predominantly influences FF behaviour. A higher electron fluence resulted in a higher radiation-induced defect density, which explains the V oc  difference between electron fluences at the same acceptor concentration. With a decrease in substrate doping level, there was an observable rise in the minority carrier concentration, leading to an increased SRH recombination due to radiation-induced defects, despite identical defect profiles (e.g. 1 ×10 14  cm �2 ) at each acceptor concentration, thereby yielding a comparable V oc  response. The dopant compensation (majority carrier removal) is directly proportional to the magnitude of electron fluence. Consequently, substrate resistivity changed as a function of electron fluence with a relatively higher impact for lightly doped substrates. In comparison to the p-TOPCon configu - ration, the PERC cell has a higher series resistance, as the majority carriers must diffuse laterally to the localized contacts according to Fig. 1(a). 4.Summary For the context of space applications, a comprehensive numerical evaluation is undertaken to assess the viability of both c-Si PERC and TOPCon solar cell technologies. Commencing with industrial PERC and n-TOPCon cells, meticulous calibration procedures are implemented, primarily concerning recombination parameters, by aligning them with the experimentally determined QE and I–V characteristics under stan - dard test conditions. Next, the parameters derived for the n-type TOP - Con cell were used to simulate a p-type TOPCon cell as it is well known that p-type silicon is less sensitive to radiation damage compared to n-  Table 5 Capture cross section values and introduction rates from previous publications together with this work.

Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    type silicon. The p-type silicon bulk is simulated assuming no recom - bination due to boron-oxygen complex by using gallium as the dopant. The effects of electron irradiance on solar cell performance are deduced from replicating literature values reported for a 50   m BSFR cell [3], leading to the derivation of defect profiles and introduction rates per - taining to radiation-induced defects. Specifically, the defect generation profile was identified to conform to an exponential decay pattern, characterized by a relatively high depth factor of 960   m. Next, these defects are introduced in the p-type PERC and TOPCon solar cells and their performance is modelled for wide range of acceptor densities and electron fluences. Across a substrate doping range spanning from 10 14  to 10 16  cm �3 , both PERC and p-TOPCon cells exhibited improved BOL power con - version efficiency with substrate resistivity. However, this enhanced BOL efficiency did not necessarily translate into superior EOL efficiency. This performance gap could be attributed to two predominant effects stemming from electron irradiation: the formation of SRH defects, leading to a reduction in V oc , and the removal of majority carriers, resulting in an increase of series resistance. Specifically, for PERC cells, the challenge of increased series resistance was accentuated by the requirement for majority carriers to traverse not only vertically but also laterally to reach the bottom metal contact. In scenarios where an effective defect recovery mechanism or a robust cover glass is lacking, substrates characterized by low doping levels proved to be more sus - ceptible to the detrimental influences of radiation-induced defects and the ensuing majority carrier removal. Within this context, TOPCon technology shows a slight advantage over PERC due to its full area contact for both minority and majority carriers. For substrates charac - terized by high doping concentrations, the EOL performance of both cell types was quite similar.

Typically, achieving excellent field-effect passivation and low contact resistivity in doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) requires heavy phosphorus doping. However, this approach can lead to a predicament wherein excessive phosphorus diffuses into the silicon (Si) substrate during annealing, consequently causing recombi - nation losses. In response to this challenge, a structure incorporating an intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si (i)) layer within the passivation layers has been introduced. The primary objective of this structure is to retard the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate. This study entails comprehensive characterizations to delve into the underlying mechanisms of films with the integrated a-Si (i) layer, including surface microscopy, active dopants profile, crystallographic structure, elemental distribution, and electrical properties. Finally, we have fabricated the industrial-sized TOPCon solar cells with an average efficiency of 23.83 %, which is 0.25 % higher than that of Baseline counterparts (23.58 %) on the production line. The above results have demonstrated the introduction of a-Si (i) film can be a buffer layer, retarding the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate and obtaining a better passivation effect, enabling us to further tailor the doping profile for high-efficiency solar cells. Our work highlights a promising strategy to improve the performance of TOPCon solar cells, showcasing the substantial potential for implementation in industrial manufacturing.    1.Introduction Due to the characteristics of renewability and sustainability, solar energy has gradually become a suitable alternative to traditional energy sources [1]. Benefiting from cost advantage, crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell technology has dominated the photovoltaic (PV) industry in the past 20 years [2]. Many cell structures have been steadily developed to date, yielding two mainstream technologies for the past few years, i. e., tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) [3] and heterojunction technology (HJT) [4]. The fabrication of TOPCon can be upgraded from the existing passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) production lines, resulting in a record efficiency of 25.8 % on n-type c-Si [5], 26.0 % on p-type c-Si [6], and 26.1 % for an IBC [7] solar cell. Therefore, TOPCon has been considered the next-generation cell technology after PERC [8], which is expected to dominate the PV market in 5 years [9]. The featuring rear passivation layer of TOPCon composed of a heavily doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) layer on ultra-thin silicon oxide (SiO x , Tox) interlayer has shown superior surface passivation and carrier selectivity by suppressing the recombination at the metal-silicon inter - face [10] and thus achieving significant efficiency gain [11]. As we know, the excellent surface passivation effect of TOPCon solar cells is attributed to ultrathin SiO x  and heavily doped poly-Si layers,  *Corresponding author. **Corresponding author.

The key to obtaining the high performance of TOPCon is the preparation of the high-quality tunnel SiO x  and heavily doped poly-Si. In terms of Tox, there have been many reports on the methods of preparation, including thermal oxidation [13–16], wet-chemical oxidation [16–18], ozone oxidation [16,17], plasma-assisted oxidation [2,19,20], and plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (PEALD) [21], resulting in the saturation current density (J 0 ) of <3 fA/cm 2  [22,23]. However, most of the above methods cannot be used in industrial production except for thermal oxidation and plasma-assisted oxidation, corresponding to the low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor depo - sition (PECVD) methods, respectively. Compared to the LPCVD method, the PECVD approach has advantages in high thin film deposition rate, less wrap-round deposition, and equipment-related consumables [22]. The tube PECVD technology integrated with in-situ tunnel SiO x  and in-situ doped polysilicon has demonstrated great potential for the mass-production TOPCon in industry [24]. However, amorphous Si (a-Si) film deposited by PECVD is suscepti - ble to poor passivated contacts while the blistering phenomenon occurs during the subsequent annealing process, leading to a significant degradation in device performance [25]. In general, the a-Si film is a technologically important semiconductor for solar cells [26,27], which offers a low defect density and tunable conduction type [28,29]. These optoelectronic advantages strongly rely on configurations of hydrogen and silicon in the three-dimensional space, and thus precise control of its microscopic structure is a critical factor in achieving good devices [30]. While PECVD deposited a-Si often contains a large amount of hydrogen (20 atomic (at.) % and more) from the silicon precursor gas, such as SiH 4  and H 2  [31]. Unfortunately, the deposited a-Si film on oxidized Si is strongly prone to blistering, both during deposition and thermal annealing, due to some of the hydrogen from the film accumulating at the film/SiO x  interface and growing into pressurized pockets causing the blistering. Blistering deteriorates the properties of the poly-Si/SiO x  interface due to the blistered areas being severely hampered, leading to the prevention of charge-carrier collection. In the worst case, blisters may rupture from the surface of poly-Si, resulting in direct contact with the metal electrodes, and thus leading to high recombination loss [32, 33]. In summary, the blistering tendency and severity of the a-Si film depend on its H content, thickness, deposition temperature, thermal processing, surface roughness, and cleanliness [32–36]. In addition, interfacial stress accumulation induced during the crystallization of a-Si film has also been related to the occurrence of blistering [37]. Moreover, while adopting the PECVD approach to fabricate TOPCon solar cells, passivating contacts are produced via high-temperature annealing in the range of 850–1000  ◦ C with a dwell time of several tens of minutes to transform the doped a-Si phase into a doped poly-Si phase [38], which guarantees a high field passivation effect. During the annealing process (particularly during the dwell time), dopants in the heavily doped poly-Si layer can diffuse into the c-Si substrate, forming a buried dopant region (called in-diffusion dopant) near the c-Si interface. Although the existence of in-diffusion dopants is beneficial for metal contact to a certain extent and thus reduces contact resistance, however, excessive dopants could severely weaken the interfacial passivation quality. To control dopant diffusion into the Si substrate and attain an optimal equilibrium, it’s essential to precisely manage and optimize the dopant concentration within the poly-Si film following the annealing process. Several works [39,40] have investigated the effect of additive intrinsic a-Si layer between SiO x  and doped a-Si (p) on the performance of p-TOPCon, indicating that the insertion of intrinsic a-Si layer could effectively regulate the doping distribution in the c-Si/SiO x /doped poly-Si structure, thereby improving the passivation performance of cells. However, it remains to be verified whether this method can achieve similar results for industrialized n-TOPCon. In this paper, we have introduced a structure with an additional a-Si (i) film to the rear passivation layers of TOPCon solar cells, aiming to control the phosphorus (P) diffusion into the Si substrate, resulting in a tunable phosphorus doping profile to further improve passivated contact cell performance. Detailed characterizations are carried out to investi - gate the underlying mechanisms of the films with the introduction of a- Si (i), including surface microscopy, active dopants profile, crystallo - graphic structure, elemental distribution and electrical properties. The morphology of the poly-Si film has been investigated by scanning elec - tron microscope (SEM) and optical microscope (OM) with different thicknesses of introduced a-Si (i) film, revealing the blistering phe - nomenon occurs when the thickness is 30 nm and above. The active dopant profile results by electrochemical capacitance-voltage profiling (ECV) show that the in-diffusion dopant can be tailored by the intro - duced a-Si (i) layer. Passivation and contact performance of TOPCon solar cells have been investigated under different thicknesses of a-Si (i) film, and then confirmed the optimal electrical properties at the thick - ness of 20 nm. Lastly, we have fabricated the industrial-sized TOPCon solar cells with an average efficiency of 23.83 %, which is 0.25 % higher than that of Baseline counterparts (23.58 %) on the production line. These above results have demonstrated the introduction of a-Si (i) can be a good buffer layer, retarding the diffusion of phosphorus towards the Si substrate while enabling us to fine-tune the doping profile and obtain a better passivation effect. Our work has great potential for the mass- production TOPCon solar cells in industry. 2.Experimental methods To evaluate the performance of TOPCon solar cells with the intro - duced a-Si (i) layer, we fabricated the rear passivation layers on the industrial Czochralski (Cz) n-type silicon wafers with a size of 182 ×182 mm 2  (M10), a thickness of 150 ±20   m, and a resistivity of 0.3–2.1  cm. Characterizations were used to analyze and understand the per - formance of TOPCon solar cells with different thicknesses of a-Si (i) film. 2.1.Fabrication of rear passivation layer Fig. 1 describes the fabrication processes of the rear passivated contact structure of TOPCon solar cells. Before the deposition of passivation layers, the n-Si substrate underwent the RCA cleaning to remove the dirt, aiming to ensure final passivation performance. The interfacial ultrathin SiO x , intrinsic a-Si, and in-situ phosphorus-doped a- Si were deposited by a tube-type PECVD system (ZR5000, LeadMicro) at 400  ◦ C with different precursor gases (SiO x : N 2 O; a-Si (i): SiH 4  and H 2 ; a- Si (n): PH 3 , SiH 4 , and H 2 , respectively). A direct radio frequency (RF) plasma source operating at 40 KHz was used. The plasma time of the SiO x  process was fixed at 3 min. The total thickness of a-Si was fixed at 140 nm in this study, and the thickness of a-Si (i) and a-Si (n) varied with the respective process time. The annealing process was carried out under nitrogen (N 2 ) ambient (AS-300E, S.C.) at the temperature of 900  ◦ C for 45 min to transform a-Si to poly-Si and activate the dopants. Lastly, a hydrogenation process was implemented by capping a 100 nm SiN x  layer deposited through the PECVD system at 450  ◦ C (PD-405C, S.C.). 2.2.Characterization The surface microscopy of samples was investigated by OM (LEICA DM 4000) and SEM (JSM-7800F). The active dopant depth profile was measured by ECV profiling (WEP, CVP21). Samples with symmetrical structures were prepared to investigate the effective minority carrier lifetime, which was measured by a quasi-steady-state photoconductance method (WCT-120, Sinton Instruments) at an injection density of 1 ×10 15  cm �3 . The single-side J 0  was determined according to the high- injection method proposed by Kane and Swanson [41,42]. The iV OC  was tested at 1-sun. The contact resistivity (  c ) was measured by the TLM (Ai-shine). The structural and chemical composition of the c-Si/SiO x /poly-Si interface was investigated by high-resolution trans - mission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Talos F200X G2).  S. Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, HP EliteDesk 800 G3 TWR) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS, GAIA3) were used to detect related element distributions and intensity for the passivation layers, respectively. The electrical parameters of TOPCon solar cells were measured by Halm 3600 under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G spectrum, 25  � C). 3.Results and discussion In this study, we have introduced the a-Si (i) film as a barrier layer situated between SiO x /a-Si (n) layers. The main purpose of this addition is to retard the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate, mitigating the recombination loss that arises from excessive phosphorus diffusion during the annealing process, as previously reported [39]. While the tunneling oxide also contributes to preventing phosphorus diffusion, it’s important to note that the passivation contact performance of TOPCon solar cells is highly sensitive to the thickness of the oxide layer. To strike a balance between these competing factors, we have maintained a constant thickness for the tunneling oxide layer throughout this study. Fig. 2 illustrates the phosphorus diffusion that occurred during the annealing process, considering varying thicknesses of the a-Si (i) film. In this study, the total thickness of the a-Si film was fixed at 140 nm. The specific thicknesses of the a-Si (i) film were set at 0 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm, corresponding to the Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4 groups respectively. Throughout the annealing process, the a-Si film transformed into poly-Si, and the doped phosphorus became active. After that, the phosphorus atoms initiated diffusion into the Si substrate. As this diffusion progressed deeper, the concentration of phosphorus began to decline after the phosphorus atoms traversed the tunneling oxide layer, and the blocking effect became more potent as the thickness of the a-Si (i) film increased. When incorporating the a-Si (i) film into the rear passivation layers of TOPCon solar cells, it’s crucial to address the blistering issue, particularly when employing the PECVD method. In this study, the samples were prepared on the polished c-Si substrate with different thicknesses of a-Si (i) film by tube PECVD method, and the rear passivation structure corresponded to the groups of Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4. To gain insights into the surface characteristics of the  Fig. 1.Fabrication processes for poly-Si/SiO x /c-Si contacts doped with phosphorus, including the RCA cleaning, PECVD deposition of tunneling oxide, intrinsic a-Si and in-situ phosphorus-doped a-Si, annealing and hydrogenation (deposition of SiN x ).  Fig. 2.Sketch of phosphorus diffusion into Si substrate during the annealing process with different thicknesses of a-Si (i) film. The thickness of a-Si (i) film was 0 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm, corresponding to the groups of Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively.  S. Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        samples before and after the annealing process, OM and SEM were used to obverse the surface microscopy of samples with the magnification of 800 and 1500, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. Observing the images, it was evident that the Baseline, G1, and G2 groups did not exhibit any instances of burst phenomena, suggesting that the presence of phos - phorus doping close to the c-Si interface played a role in preventing the a-Si film from bursting during the annealing process. However, as the thickness of the a-Si (i) layer reached a certain value (G3), the surface began to manifest unevenly sized bubbles, which indicated the occur - rence of poly-Si film cracking or peeling off from the Si substrate. Comparing the appearance of the film before and after annealing, it was apparent that the annealing process exacerbated the burst phenomenon, leading to larger bubble sizes, which could be attributed to the release and escape of hydrogen (H) during the high-temperature annealing process. When the thickness of the a-Si (i) film was further increased (G4), the size of the burst area was noticeably larger even before annealing. These observations indicated that while heavy phosphorus doping in the a-Si layer could prevent bursting to some extent, the sit - uation changed when the thickness of the a-Si (i) layer exceeded a specific threshold. Beyond this point, the burst phenomenon occurred and worsened as the film’s thickness increased. As reported in the literature, the crystallization of a-Si film leads to the accumulation of interfacial stress and rapid release of hydrogen, which are thought to be the main causes of film blistering [43,44]. Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate this problem, including implementing a slow heat treatment to gradually release hydrogen during the annealing process [34], using Ar instead of H 2  to control the H content or porosity of the film [33,35,45], and combining the elements carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and phosphorus (P) into the polysilicon film during deposition [2,37,46–48]. To evaluate the influence of the poly-Si with different thicknesses of a-Si (i) film on the TOPCon solar cells, characterizations were conducted on the rear passivation layer. Firstly, we used the ECV method to mea - sure the concentration of active phosphorus within the poly-Si film as shown in Fig. 4(a). It could be seen from the figure that the concentration of active phosphorus within poly-Si was close to 6E20 cm �3 . Compared with the group of Baseline, the group of G1 had a similar C–V curve, revealing its analogous blocking effect on phosphorus diffusion. While the thickness of a-Si (i) further increased, the decline curve became steeper, indicating the more obvious blocking effect on phosphorus diffusion. The aforementioned observations substantiated that the doping profile could be accurately regulated through the incorporation of the a-Si (i) layer. To gain a deeper understanding of the performance of the rear passivation layer with varying thicknesses of a- Si (i) film, we conducted investigations into the passivation and contact properties of the TOPCon solar cells. Fig. 4(b) illustrates the symmetrical structure (I) used for testing the iV OC , J 0 , and lifetime. Additionally, the semi-manufactured structure (II) designed for measuring contact re - sistivity (  c ) using the TLM was presented in the figure. The corre - sponding results of passivation and contact properties were displayed in Fig. 4(c) and (d), respectively. As seen from Fig. 4(c), when the thick - nesses of a-Si (i) increased from 0 nm to 20 nm, the corresponding iV OC  increased from 726.1 mV to 736.6 mV, the lifetime increased from 1028   s to 1729   s, and J 0  decreased from 11.1 fA/cm 2  to 4.3 fA/cm 2 , i.e., the passivation performance of the samples increased in turn. This could be attributed to the few phosphorus atoms diffused to the Si substrate with the increased thickness of a-Si (i), which aligned well with the ECV re - sults. As the thicknesses of a-Si (i) further increased to more than 20 nm, the passivation performance began to slightly decrease, revealing the best result was acquired at the thicknesses of 20 nm. This might be related to the blistering phenomenon of poly-Si film as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4(d), the contact performance of TOPCon solar cells with different thicknesses of a-Si (i) was measured by TLM. The top views of the structures of samples (III) were illustrated in the figure. It could be seen from the figure that when there was no a-Si (i), the measured contact resistivity achieved the minimum value, showing the best con - tact performance. When the thickness of introduced a-Si (i) increased to 20 nm, the contact resistivity slightly increased, while the thickness exceeded 40 nm, the contact resistivity increased significantly, which could be due to the low concentration of the in-diffusion phosphorus as  Fig. 3.OM photograph and SEM images of the samples before and after annealing. The thickness of a-Si (i) film was 0 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm, corresponding to the groups of Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively.  S. Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        shown in Fig. 4(a). Considering both the passivation and contact per - formance, it had been established that the TOPCon solar cells achieved the optimal performance with the introduced a-Si (i) of 20 nm. These research outcomes underscored the value of introducing the a-Si (i) film as a buffer layer, which effectively retarded the diffusion of phosphorus into the Si substrate, leading to enhanced passivation effects.

The samples were fabricated with different thicknesses of introduced a-Si (i) film, and the thickness was 0 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm, corresponding to the groups of Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively.

Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        strategic addition allowed for fine-tuning the doping profile, ultimately contributing to the development of high-efficiency solar cells. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of the introduced a-Si (i) on the microstructures of poly-Si/SiO x /c-Si contacts, HR-TEM ana - lyses were conducted on both the Baseline and optimized G2 groups after the annealing process, and the results were presented in Fig. 5. In the micrographs, the interface tunneling oxide layer displayed a uniform thickness acquired through the PECVD method, and the thickness range of 1.3–1.4 nm for the SiO x  film was further confirmed by local HR-TEM images. The pronounced crystallization patterns in the poly-Si film were corroborated by distinct diffraction spots evident in the Fourier trans - form. In contrast to the G2 samples, the Baseline samples exhibited more pronounced polycrystalline structures, alongside amorphous rings with a greater number of discernible diffraction spots. This observation indicated a heightened level of crystallinity following the annealing process [49]. Moreover, the cross-sectional EDS distributions and net intensity for the two related samples were shown in Fig. 5(c and f) and Fig. 5(g), respectively. A phosphorus signal could be observed in the SiO x  layer and c-Si substrate as shown in Fig. 5(c and f). The cumulative intensity of Si and O atoms across the specific section (yellow dashed line illustrated in Fig. 5(b and e)) indicated the emergence of a tunneling oxide layer. To further investigate the change of O, P, and H atoms after annealing, SIMS was used to detect the intensity of atoms as a function of depth. Fig. 5(h) displayed the SIMS spectra, and the intensity change of O atoms was similar to the results shown in Fig. 5(g). In terms of P atoms, the Baseline group exhibited a notably higher P concentration, particularly after traversing the tunneling oxide layer, which was consistent with the ECV curve shown in Fig. 4(a). These above obser - vations have demonstrated the introduced a-Si (i) layer with an adequate thickness can tailor the doping profile, thereby reducing the recombination loss in the c-Si region, ultimately leading to a better passivated contact cell performance. In the final evaluation of the introduced a-Si (i) performance at the device level (M10 wafer), TOPCon solar cells were fabricated using passivation layers based on the Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4 groups through the TOPCon production line, and the results of electrical pa - rameters were illustrated in Fig. 6. The trend in V OC  variations with different a-Si (i) thicknesses was consistent with the iV OC  measurements. Notably, the G2 group achieved the highest V OC  value of 715 mV, attributed to the blocking effect on phosphorus diffusion. The J SC  value remained unchanged with varying a-Si (i) thickness, implying that the introduction of a-Si (i) did not lead to additional optical absorption loss. However, the FF value decreased with increasing a-Si (i) thickness, particularly in the G4 group. This reduction was primarily due to the limited diffusion of P atoms into the substrate, resulting in poor metal - lization contact performance. The most significant observation was the enhancement in conversion efficiency (  ), which improved from 23.58 % to 23.83 % as the a-Si (i) thickness increased from 0 nm to 20 nm. This improvement indicated that the introduction of a-Si (i) could substan - tially enhance the electrical properties of TOPCon solar cells. On the other hand, when the thickness exceeded 20 nm, both the cell efficiency and V OC  slightly dropped (23.71 % and 23.43 %), potentially due to the blistering phenomenon of poly-Si discussed earlier in Fig. 3. Our research showed that when the thickness of introduced a-Si (i) was 20 nm, the    of TOPCon solar cells improved by 0.25 %, and no blistering was observed simultaneously. These results demonstrated the intro - duction of a-Si (i) with an adequate thickness was a promising strategy to improve the performance of TOPCon solar cells and has great po - tential in industrial manufacturing. 4.Conclusions In summary, this study introduced an additional layer of a-Si (i) layer with a carefully determined thickness, yielding multiple beneficial ef - fects on the performance of TOPCon solar cells. This strategy effectively controlled the doping profile, mitigating the excessive diffusion of phosphorus dopants into the c-Si substrate and consequently reducing recombination losses. Detailed characterizations were carried out to uncover the underlying mechanisms. OM and SEM analyses demon - strated the occurrence of blistering when the a-Si (i) layer thickness reached 30 nm, with increased severity as thickness further increased. Measurements using ECV corroborated the efficient control of in- diffusion dopant by the a-Si (i) layer. The passivation study showed that the optimal performance was obtained at the thickness of 20 nm, with the iV OC  of 736.6 mV and J 0  of 4.3 fA/cm 2 , and the deterioration of passivation beyond 20 nm was attributed to blistering effects. Contact resistivity of 1.4 m cm 2  was extracted from TLM for the introduced a-Si (i) layer with a thickness of 20 nm. In addition, when the thickness of the a-Si (i) layer surpassed 20 nm, there was a significant increment in contact resistance, which could be attributed to the decreased concen - tration of in-diffused phosphorus within the Si substrate. HR-TEM ana - lyses exhibited the presence of a uniformly thick tunneling oxide at the  Fig. 6.Measured J-V parameters of TOPCon solar cells by adopting different rear passivation layers according to the groups of Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4 on the production line using 182 Θ182 mm 2  Si wafers. The thickness of a-Si (i) film is 0 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, and 40 nm, corresponding to the groups of Baseline, G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively.  S. Ma et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        interface of c-Si. Additionally, the Fourier transform of the poly-Si film displayed distinct diffraction spots, indicating pronounced crystalliza - tion behaviors. Moreover, supplementary elemental studies conducted using EDS and SIMS further confirmed that the in-diffusion phosphorus concentration within the optimal group (G2) was lower compared to the Baseline group. This outcome corroborated the evident blocking effect on phosphorus diffusion, as previously demonstrated through ECV re - sults. Lastly, the industrial M10 TOPCon solar cells were fabricated on the production line, achieving an average efficiency of 23.83 % with the introduced 20 nm a-Si (i) layer, which was 0.25 % higher than that of Baseline counterparts (23.58 %). The above results have demonstrated that the introduction of a-Si (i) to the rear passivation layer was a promising strategy to improve the performance of TOPCon solar cells, and showed tremendous potential in industrial manufacturing.

Screen printing is the standard metallization technique, but there is an increasing interest in the development of methods that allow more versatility, higher process control, and a more efficient use of the expensive metallic pastes used. We focus here on the comparison between the standard screen-printing method, and Light-Induced Forward-Transfer (LIFT), a non-contact, very precise technique, able to transfer volumes down to picolitres. The high flexibility, using free-form designs that do not depend on any mask or physical support, and the efficient use of the metallic paste with almost no waste, are other characteristics that point out LIFT as a very promising alternative. In this paper we include the electric characterization of contacts, and solar silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cells metalized with both techniques. The results show a slightly better efficiency for the screen-printed cells, but good series resistance and fill factor values imply that LIFT is a promising alternative for device metallization.    1.Introduction Monocrystalline silicon cells based on the Pasivated Emmiter Rear Cell (PERC) structure currently dominate the photovoltaic power gen - eration market. However, this technology has certain limitations, including inherent issues such as gap narrowing and Auger recombi - nation losses, as well as challenges related to the structure of the solar cell, such as recombination losses in the contact area. To address these limitations, researchers are continuously searching for more efficient and cost-effective devices. One promising alternative is the use of passivating-contact cells, such as silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cells. In SHJ cells, highly doped p and n contact zones are replaced by a sandwich of intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films and doped a-Si:H counterparts. Compared to traditional monocrystalline silicon cells, SHJ cells offer several advantages, including a better tem - perature coefficient, higher open-circuit voltage, higher conversion ef - ficiency, lower performance degradation, and strong bifacial performance [1,2]. These advantages make SHJ cells a promising candidate for improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of photo - voltaic power generation. But while SHJ is a promising alternative to PERC, it also faces its own challenges. One challenge is that low-temperature processes are neces - sary when working with SHJ cells. If the cell temperature exceeds 200  ◦ C, hydrogen from the a-Si:H layers is expelled, deteriorating the properties of the a-Si:H thin films and specifically, degrading the passivation of the crystalline silicon surfaces. To mitigate this issue, low- curing temperature pastes are used for the metallization of SHJ cells. However, these types of pastes present a higher electric resistivity than the pastes used in the metallization of other c-Si cells. To address this challenge, pastes with a higher silver concentration (more than 90 %) can be used, as well as using grid electrodes with larger cross-sections. However, this approach increases the cost of device fabrication. In fact, metallization is a limiting step in cell efficiency and a determining factor in the cost of manufacturing SHJ cells. Therefore, reducing the metallization cost is one of the main challenges in the development of SHJ cells. Any advance in a more efficient use of Ag pastes is welcome [2,3], as it can help reduce the cost of manufacturing SHJ cells and improve their competitiveness in the market. The most common technique for metallizing SHJ cells is screen printing, a reliable, high-productivity technique. Nonetheless, various  *Corresponding authors.

These include Pattern Transfer Printing (PTP), which uses lasers to transfer contacts from a polymer tape to the cell surface [4]; Cu electroplating, which involves additional steps of masking and mask-removal [5]; SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT), which uses copper wires coated with a low melting point alloy [6]; and inkjet printing and FlexTrail printing, which use a voltage-controlled nozzle or a hollow glass capillary to achieve a smaller contact width [7]. One particularly interesting transferring technique is Laser Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT), which involves placing the material to be transferred (the donor layer) onto a transparent substrate (the donor substrate) over the desired substrate (the acceptor substrate), at a fixed distance determined by a spacer. A laser beam is then focused on the interface between the donor layer and donor substrate. By selecting a wavelength that can pass through the transparent substrate and be absorbed by the donor layer, the latter can be partially ejected if a high enough laser fluence is used. A simplified view of the main elements involved in the LIFT process is depicted in Fig. 1. This straightforward transferring mechanism makes LIFT a powerful and versatile technique that can work with a variety of donor materials, including inks, pastes, and even solid metallic films [8–10]. The versa - tility of LIFT has led to a wide range of applications, including surface functionalization [11–13], additive manufacturing processes such as the deposition of large aspect ratio pillars, bridges, or more complex designs [14–16], and applications in the field of biomedicine, where the precise control inherent in the process allows for the transfer of single living cells [17–20]. However, perhaps the most direct application is the printing of metallic (and insulating) materials for building electronic circuit elements such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors [21], or as in this study, to deposit the metal grid in a photovoltaic solar cell. There are several parameters involved in optimizing the LIFT process for printing metallic pastes. These include the viscosity and thickness of the donor film, the laser pulse fluence, the overlap between adjacent laser pulses, the roughness of the acceptor material, and the gap between the donor and acceptor [22–25]. With fast-imaging acquisition tech - niques, it is possible to observe how the transfer mechanism develops [22,26]. In the case of high-viscosity materials, such as the metallic pastes used in solar cell metallization, the process proceeds as follows: the absorption of the laser radiation at the donor layer/donor substrate interface causes an increase in temperature, leading to the formation of vapor bubbles and the subsequent bulging of the film due to the high pressure generated. As the fluence further increases, the donor film goes from the appearance of the bulge to the breaking or even the explosion of that bulge with the expulsion of material clumps and particles. The right laser pulse fluence and the presence of the acceptor substrate at an adequate distance led to the bulge of metallic paste touching the acceptor and forming a column of paste between donor and acceptor. Finally, when the donor substrate/film is lifted, the column breaks, leaving a paste dot on the acceptor substrate [22,27]. The viscosity of the paste must also be optimized. While a lower density requires a lower pulse fluence for successful transfer, it results in wider voxels and lines. On the other hand, higher densities facilitate the transfer of smaller voxels, but consecutive line deposition becomes impractical [28]. In this study, we explore LIFT as an alternative method for the metallization of SHJ solar cells. Furthermore, the photovoltaic research community is increasingly interested in validating alternative materials as selective contacts [29], with the aim of reducing the carbon footprint by minimizing high-polluting and energy-demanding deposition pro - cesses. Many promising materials, such as 2D materials or organic molecules, require soft post-deposition steps. In this regard, the gentle nature and versatility of LIFT deposition make it an attractive metalli - zation technique beyond its application to SHJ solar cells. To assess its viability, we present a simple and straightforward comparison between LIFT and screen printing for the metallization of solar cells. Firstly, we focus on parameterizing the LIFT process to obtain metallic lines with suitable electrical and morphological characteristics for the intended application. Next, we compare the electrical charac - teristics of solar cells metallized by LIFT and screen printing. We conduct the study using SHJ solar cells, a photovoltaic technology that needs to limit any processing step to temperatures below approximately 200  ◦ C, making it a relevant example for other upcoming technologies. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the LIFT process for the specific case of solar cell metallization. 2.Materials and methods For all the experiments presented, we utilized a commercial silver paste that was specifically produced for the metallization of SHJ cells (Solamet PV416 from DuPont). The paste has a solid content of 81 %— 84 % and a viscosity of 90–130 Pas according to the product datasheet. It is designed for curing at low temperatures ranging from 130  ◦ C to 180  ◦ C. We conducted tests to measure the electrical resistance of printed lines cured at different temperatures and curing times and observed minimal differences. Therefore, we settled on a curing process of 180  ◦ C for 10 min since SHJ cells also require a final curing step at temperatures of approximately 180  ◦ C to recover the passivation lost after indium-tin- oxide (ITO) deposition [30]. The paste is optimized for screen printing, so it can be used as received for that application. However, viscosity is a critical parameter that needs to be optimized for the LIFT process. Thus, we included a parametrization of the paste viscosity by diluting the as- received product with the recommended thinner (Thinner 8260 from DuPont) in a range of 3 %wt—7%wt for the optimization of the LIFT process. The LIFT process was carried out as follows: first, the silver paste was spread onto a cleaned glass slide to a thickness of 70 µm using a blade coater (Control Coater model 101 RK from PrintCoat Instruments Ltd.). To control the gap between the donor and acceptor, we affixed a 115 µm- thick polyamide tape (Kapton tape from DuPont) to the donor substrate, creating a gap of approximately 45 µm between the donor layer and the acceptor substrate. As we had prior experience with depositing voxels using similar high-viscosity silver paste [28], our focus was on depos - iting and curing continuous lines. The laser system used was a ns-pulsed, Nd:VO 4  DPSS laser source (Explorer from Spectra Physics) that emitted at 532 nm with a full width at half maximum of 15 ns and a maximum power of 2 W (at 50 kHz). The beam waist of the laser system at the focus position was measured to be 18   m using the ablation threshold method [31]. Finally, the beam was directed to the sample via a galvo scanner with a f-theta lens and focused onto the interface between the donor substrate and silver paste film, ready to transfer the paste. For the screen-printing process, we used a semi-automatic screen printer (AT-25PA from ATMA) to print different patterns, with lines  Fig. 1.Schematic description of a LIFT process used to transfer a metallic paste from a donor substrate onto an acceptor.  C. Munoz-Garcia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         widths of approximately 80–100 µm wide. The stainless-steel screens used were provided by Sefar and had a 325-mesh count with a wire diameter of 23 µm and standard mesh angle of  =22.5 ◦ . The morphology of the transferred lines was measured with a confocal microscope (DCM3D, Leica Microsystems). To study its elec - trical characteristics, lines of different length ranging from 4 mm to 15 mm (see Fig. 2a) were transferred onto ITO-covered glass substrates and the electrical resistance of the lines were measured using a Keithley 2000 multimeter according to the four-point probe method. The re - sistivity of the transferred lines can then be calculated from:  Δ = Θ•ΛΞ(1)  where R is the line’s measured resistance, L is the line length, and A is the line cross-section. In SHJ solar cells, the front metal grid is in direct contact with an ITO layer. Thus, the contact resistivity of the transferred lines with the ITO substrates was also evaluated. The specific contact resistivity was determined by the TLM method [32], using either parallel lines (LIFT, see Fig. 2b top) or parallel contact pads (Screen printing, see Fig. 2b bottom). In the TLM analysis, the measured resistance R T  between two lines or pads of width W and spaced a distance d can be expressed as: Θ Π = Θ ΣΥ (Φ+2Ξ Π )Ψ(2)  with R sh  being the sheet resistance of the ITO substrate, and L T  the transfer length. Thus, by measuring R T  for different d values, R sh  and L T  can be obtained, and the specific contact resistivity ( Δ c ) can be calcu - lated as:  Δ Ω =Θ ΣΥ Ξ Π2 .(3) Following the optimization of the LIFT process for transferring the conductive silver paste, SHJ solar cells (see Fig. 3) were fabricated were the front metal grid was deposited by either LIFT or screen-printing. The solar cells were fabricated using 280   m-thick double-side polished n- type c-Si wafers 〈100〉with a resistivity of 1–3  cm. The different amorphous silicon thin films were deposited in a two-chamber plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) commercial reactor (Electtrorava s.p.a.) following the sequence found in [33]. The back contact consisted on a full-area Ag electrode deposited in a thermal evaporation system (Univex300, Leybold GmbH). Lastly, the front side was covered with an 80 nm thick ITO layer sputtered at room temper - ature using an Ar atmosphere from a In 2 O 3 :SnO 2  (90/10 wt%) ceramic target powered by DC (Univex 450B, Leybold). For the metallization of the front contact, we used a design consisting in a solid frame 0.85 mm wide, leaving a cell area of 1 cm 2  with five parallel fingers, 100 µm wide, regularly spaced with a pitch of 1.67 mm to extract the electric current (see Fig. 2c). The current density–voltage (JV) characteristics of the devices were measured under illumination, calibrated at AM1.5G conditions and 100 mW/cm 2 , using a class A solar simulator (Steuernagel SC575). Addi - tionally, Suns-V oc  measurements were performed (WCT-120, Sinton Instrument) to evaluate the series resistance (R s ) as detailed in [34]. 3.Results 3.1.Morphology optimization of transferred lines To make an objective comparison regarding the performance of the transferred lines obtained by the two techniques, the aim with the LIFT process was to achieve lines approximately 100 µm wide, similar to the screen-printed results. In our first attempt, we tried to transfer lines by using the as-received paste (no further dilution) and employing pulse energies (E p ) ranging between 10.5 µJ and 27 µJ while keeping pulse frequency at 20 KHz and the scanner speed at 1 m/s. Even at the highest energies employed we could not observe any material transferred onto the acceptor, indicating that possibly the viscosity of the paste was excessively high for the set-up used. Therefore, the next step was to study the effect of diluting down the paste by pre-mixing it with a controlled percentage of thinner. We prepared different dilutions, spanning from a 4 % weight dilution up to a 7 %, and performed several LIFT processes by varying E p  from 10.5 µJ and 27 µJ. Regarding the lines’ width achieved, Fig. 4a shows the measured values as a function of E p  at different dilution percentage using a glass substrate. For a given dilution percentage there is an E p  threshold below which no paste is transferred (indicated by the lines prior the first data points in Fig. 4). Above that threshold, as E p  increases, each pulse transfers a higher amount of paste, and wider lines are obtained. Likewise, the effect of the dilution percentage is that wider lines are obtained as higher dilutions are used. On the one hand, a more diluted paste has a lower energy threshold for the LIFT process (more diluted  Fig. 2.Different patterns transferred using the LIFT technique and screen-printing for the characterization of the line resistivity (a) and the specific contact resistivity using the TLM analysis (b); and for the metallization of the SHJ solar cells (c).

Munoz-Garcia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         pastes can be transferred at lower Ep as observed in prior studies [30]). On the other hand, transferred pastes with lower viscosity spread more easily as they reach the acceptor substrate, explaining the observed re - sults. With a weight dilution of a 4 % and a pulse energy of 15.15   J, we obtained a transferred lines’ width of 120   m. None of the lines completed achieved the objective of a 100 µm width. However, the paste used is specifically designed to provide a good adhesion to ITO substrates. By changing the acceptor from glass to ITO, the better adhesion reduces droplet spreading and the width of the lines is significantly reduced as shown in Fig. 4b, where we show line widths closer to 100 µm. Since with ITO the spreading of the droplets as they hit the acceptor substrate is reduced, the effect of E p  is also diminished and the variation in width is significantly reduced. For this reason, for subsequent experiments we fixed E p  at 19.5 µJ since the widths obtained were only marginally larger compared to lower E p  values and we observed a better homogeneity along the transferred lines together with improved reproducibility between experiments. With increased adhesion, we also observed a more irregular trans - ferred lines (see left image in Fig. 5) with regions where just one of each two pulses transferred material. We ascribe this effect to an excessive overlap: when adjacent pulses are too close the gas bubble generated by a pulse can be connected to the cavity produced by the previous one, leading to no paste transfer. This effect on the interaction between adjacent pulses leading to transfer failures has been previously reported by several authors [35,36]. It is therefore necessary to adopt a larger spot pitch to avoid interactions and ensure a successful transfer [37].In this work, by doubling the speed of the process and increasing the spot pitch we obtained continuous lines with a smooth morphology and widths of 105–110 µm and 0.21 aspect ratio [see Fig. 5 right], reaching the proposed objective. 3.2.Electrical properties of the transferred lines and contact resistance Using the pattern shown in Fig. 2a, we transferred silver paste lines by LIFT with the optimized lasing parameters (f �20 kHz, v �2 m/s, Ep �19.5 µJ and a 4 % dilution) as well as by screen-printing. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the lines obtained by both techniques exhibit a uniform appearance although printed lines are slightly narrower and lower than LIFT transferred lines (aspect ratio for LIFT lines is ~ 0.2 compared to ~ 0.15). Fig. 7 shows the measured resistance (after sintering at 180 ≽C) as a function of the line length. For both techniques, the resistivity calculated  Fig. 4.(a) Width of lines deposited by LIFT onto a glass substrate as function of laser pulse energy, for different percentages of thinner. (b) Effect of using different acceptor substrate (Glass or ITO) for lines transferred at different pulse energies (thinner 4 %). Laser repetition frequency (20 kHz), process speed (1 m/s), donor film thickness (70 µm) and gap between donor and acceptor (45 µm) remained fixed in (a) and (b). The width value and the error bars represent the average and the deviation of five different measurements taken along the length of the lines.

Munoz-Garcia et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         using equation (1) is ~ 20 µcm for the screen-printed lines and ~ 40 µcm for the lines deposited by LIFT. The reason why the lines deposited by LIFT showed a higher resistivity is unclear but could be related to a combination of i) a reduction in the metal loading per unit area in thinned down pastes; and ii) larger inhomogeneity in the lines’ cross sections (compared to screen printed lines) leading to an over estimation in the resistivity. Nevertheless, both values are less than a factor of ten lower than typical values obtained for printed silver lines sintered at much higher temperatures [38] and only one order of magnitude lower than bulk silver (~1.6 µcm). Next, we measured the specific contact resistance of the deposited silver paste with the ITO substrate using the patterns shown in Fig. 2b for LIFT (top image) and screen-printing (bottom image). The measured resistance as a function of the distance between the contacts is plotted in Fig. 8, and the values obtained from the fitting of the data to equations (2) and (3) are collected in Table 1. The results obtained for both methods are again very similar (note that the differences in the slopes in Fig. 8 are due to the differences in contact length, W). The extracted sheet resistance for the ITO substrate is the same with either sample (and correct as checked with a four-point probe system), validating the experimental data. And since there are minimal differences in the transfer length, the specific contact resistance is also comparable, and both below the target value of 5 m cm 2  deemed acceptable for silicon heterojunction technology [38]. 3.3.Heterojunction silicon solar cells performance To conclude the comparison study, we completed the front grid metallization of four different SHJ solar cells with LIFT and screen- printing according to the design in Fig. 2c.

As can be seen from Table 2, both techniques delivered cells achieving a very similar performance. Since the solar cells used for this study were not textured, the maximum efficiency is limited by the low short circuit current (J sc ). The metallization step is expected to have the biggest impact to the fill-factor (FF) since it is directly affected by resistive losses, and to J sc  due to shadowing effects. The open-circuit voltage (V oc ) is mostly governed by the quality of the junction and thus the metallization process has limited impact unless the curing temperature is above the amorphous silicon films processing temperature. The values of FF measured for both metallization techniques were the same (74 % for the best performing cells and 71 % for the other two cells). The values of J sc  were lower for the two cells with the contacts transferred by LIFT as seen in Fig. 8, with the differences observed being consistent with the finger widths achieved (around 110 µm for LIFT contacts and 80 µm for screen-printed ones). In accordance with the values of the specific contact resistivity shown in subsection 3.2, the R s  values calculated according to [34] using the Suns-V oc  method were slightly smaller for the screen-printed cells, but hardly a significant difference (see Table 2 and the differences in slope of the JV curves at high forward voltages). Ultimately, these results suggest that LIFT is a valid metallization technique, comparable to screen-printing in terms of solar-cell perfor - mance. Furthermore, LIFT has some inherent qualities that makes it a very interesting metallization option worth investigating. On the one hand, LIFT is much more flexible than screen-printing, allowing any pattern to be printed almost on the go, without the need for masks. In addition, the use of the silver paste can be further optimize with the LIFT technique, minimizing silver-paste wastage often observed in screen- printing. On the other hand, screen-printing is still more suited for a production-level metallization process, giving it a great advantage over LIFT in the industrial setting. Nevertheless, there are many examples of applications that have implemented LIFT at an industrial level, such as printing OLED pixels in high-end televisions [39] or chip bonding and assembly in the microelectronics industry [40]. But, LIFT micro - fabrication is not limited to 2D structures only, 3D structures can be made repeating the laser transfer process of individual voxels at the same location [15]. In recent years, interest in using LIFT techniques for different materials has increased, the main applications being micro - electronics, flexible electronics and photovoltaics. In conclusion, we have before us a new innovative technique that will allow its industrial integration in different strategic sectors once it reaches its highest point of maturity [41]. Therefore, with enough effort and research geared towards this particular application, both in terms of the silver-paste composition and the LIFT process, it could end up challenging screen-printing as the de facto technique for the metallization of solar cells. 4.Conclusions We have presented a comparison between LIFT and screen-printing as the metallization method for silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, using a commercial silver paste specifically designed for this solar cell technology. By adjusting the laser power and the rheology of the silver paste (adding a thinning agent), we could systematically transfer silver lines 110 µm wide when using ITO as the acceptor substrate, while the screen-printed lines were 80–100   m wide. After curing the lines at 180  δ C, the measured line resistivity for both techniques was in the order of 20 µcm for the screen-printed lines and 40 µcm for the lines deposited by LIFT, both values suitable for the studied application. Regarding the specific contact resistivity between m  the silver paste transferred and the ITO substrate, both techniques achieved similar re - sults, with LIFT obtaining a slightly larger value (3.45 m cm 2  vs 3.04 m cm 2 ). Once again, both values are well below the minimum required target of 5 cm 2  for SHJ technology. Finally, SHJ cells metallized with both technologies showed comparable performances, especially regarding the fill factor achieved, a parameter that is directly affected to any resistive losses that may incur due to a faulty metallization. The solar cell metallized using LIFT had a slightly lower short-circuit current as a result of the slightly wider contact fingers. In conclusion, we have shown that the LIFT technique is suitable for the fabrication of SHJ solar cells and that with enough research towards this particular process, it could end up being a viable industrial alternative to screen-printing with added flexibility and reduced silver consumption.

The specific silanol group vibration peaks in FT-IR spectra confirm the mechanism of the blistering free surface formation. The blistering affects not only the appearance but also the implied Voc of the cells, that is to say, the quality of the passivation [10]. The hydrogen containing species (by-product of the ALD process) will bond to the SiO2  (bot h Si and O atom site) which grows after the thermal treatment with oxygen. Due to the good diffusivity within the SiO 2  layer, the amount of hydrogen out-diffusing towards the SiN X  ARC layer after firing can be reduced to achieve blistering free silicon solar cells.    © 2015 The Authors.

Introduction Al 2O3  films are often used in n-type silicon solar cells for passivation of p+ doped surface. The thermal stability of the Al 2O3  is important as the film would go through a high temperature firing process. The deterioration in passivation quality after firing is due to an increase in interface trap density, Dit [1], resulting from the dissociation of interfacial Si-H bonds during the firing process, with hydrogen released from the passivation film. Blistering occurs [2] when hydrogen species (atom, ion or H 2  molecules) can’t diffuse out during firing, locally accumulating in the SiN X  capping layer, which acts as a barrier. Not only the cell appearance is affected (white dots present on SiN X  surface) but also the passivation performance is impacted.

In this article, a thermal treatment in specific gas environment is proposed to eliminate blistering. 2.   Experiment In this study, 6-inch n-type Cz silicon wafers with a thickness of 180  �˛ m were used. After texturing, the wafers were then doped with boron for front emitter, and with phosphorous for back surface field. The samples were then deposited with Al 2O3  using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) [4]. Finally, a SiN X  ARC layer was deposited on the samples using PECVD. The samples were fired in an industrial belt driven fast firing furnace at a set peak  temperature. We surveyed the appearance of our samples by ZETA’s 3D-OM, and analyzed the bonding  configuration by BRUKER’s FT-IR spectrometer. We also used Sinton Instrument’s Suns-Voc to monitor the implied Voc.    3.   Results and discussion 3.1.   Optical properties Fig. 1 shows the microscope observations of the sample surface, after firing, with a 20X objective. The white spots in Fig. 1(a) indicate local blistering of the dielectric stack with thermal treatment A (N 2  rich gas environment). No blistering is observed in Fig. 1(b) for the samples with thermal treatment B (O 2  rich environment).     Fig. 1. The microscope observations of the surface after firing: (a) thermal treatment A (N 2  rich environment) and (b) thermal treatment B (O2 rich environment).    Infrared spectroscopy is sensitive to OH-related functional groups and gives information about hydrogen's bonding state. Fig. 2 shows FTIR spectra of the samples. Silanol groups (Si-OH) [5, 6, 7] are one of the major indicators that the hydrogen species are trapped by the oxide layer, which formed after the thermal treatment. The assignations for the four spectral components in Fig. 2(a) are listed in Table 1, and the corresponding bonding  configurations are shown in Fig. 3(a)-(c). In Fig. 2(b), the specific IR peak is due to the intra-molecular cyclic hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3(d)), consistent with the observation of the 2360 cm-1 band in [8] [9]. The absorbance intensity of 3745 cm-1(germinal OH vibration) is higher than 3652 and 3622 cm-1 (inter-molecular cyclic configuration OH vibration). This can be supported by the following argument; due to the large O … H distance and HO … H angles, the steric effect increases the difficulties to form an inter-molecular cyclic configuration.

We supposed that with treatment B, hydrogen species preferentially moved into the oxide layer since molecular hydrogen has a higher diffusivity [11] within SiO 2  than in SiN X . The hydrogen will out-diffuse from the Al 2O3  layer due to the high firing temperature. If the oxide layer is thick enough to trap or “dissolve” the hydrogen species, the hydrogen will not out-diffuse to the ARC layer and stuck on the top of the surface, resulting in blistering. 3.2.   Electrical properties In the following part, we compared the implied VOC between the two annealing recipes just after the simulated firing process. Fig. 4 shows that the thermal treatment B has a higher implied Voc than A. This is because the firing temperature will induce the out-diffusion of the species containing hydrogen from the AlO X  layer. The O 2  rich gas environment will form a thicker oxide layer between the silicon substrate and AlO X  layer. Table 2 shows the order of the hydrogen diffusion coefficients in the dielectric films [12-14]. The diffusivity of the hydrogen in the SiO 2  under such a high firing temperature is two orders higher than in the AlO X . So, obviously most of the species containing hydrogen will diffuse into the SiO 2  layer. This forms a hydrogen rich SiO 2  film, and furthermore reduces the defect density between the Si/ SiO 2  interface.  In thermal treatment A, the N 2  rich gas environment results in a thinner SiO 2  layer. There is not enough space to accommodate the hydrogen species. So, most of the species will out-diffuse from the AlO X  layer and are then stuck in the SiN X , which acts as barrier layer. This makes the blistering and meanwhile a lower implied VOC appear. We supposed that blistering leads to a degradation of the passivation properties.    Table 2.

Conclusion In this work, we investigated the thermal treatment before Al 2O3  ALD with two different gas environment to avoid the surface blistering after high temperature fast firing. A clear correlation between the blistering behavior and thermal treatment is in existence. Blistering-free samples have better passivation and results in a higher implied Voc than those with blistering. We use OM to monitor the surface blistering, and FT-IR to confirm that the hydrogen  species react with the oxide, resulting in less out-diffusion to the ARC layer. So, the out-diffusion of the hydrogen  can be controlled by various treatments, and oxide growth by the thermal treatment before ALD plays a key role to the formation of the blistering behavior and the passivation quality.

A low- temperature procedure is implemented to deposit the first anti-epitaxial i-a-Si:H buffer layer (I1 layer) of ~1.5 nm thickness with a high hydrogen concentration and a low refractive index prior to the second bulk i-a-Si:H layer (I2 layer) of ~5.5 nm thickness. The effects of the growth temperature and ignition power during depo - sition on the optical and structural properties of the i-a-Si:H buffer layers are investigated, and the impact of the buffer layers on carrier transport and collection is also evaluated. Utilizing this strategy, a trade-off between guaranteed passivation capability and low contact resistivity results in an improvement of 0.21% abs  in power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is mainly driven by increases in V oc  and FF, and a certified PCE of 25.92 %, with a high open circuit voltage (V oc ) of 749.7 mV, is achieved on a full-area M6-size industry-grade silicon wafer.    1.Introduction Surface passivation of crystalline silicon (c-Si) is essential for achieving state-of-the-art photovoltaic devices [1–3]. Silicon hetero - junction (SHJ) solar cells require a high open circuit voltage to achieve high power conversion efficiency [4–6], which can be realized by effective passivation. In this approach, a passivation layer is typically formed on the crystalline silicon surface of SHJ solar cells [7–9], which consists of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) materials [10,11]. Passivation decreases the number of carrier recombination centers be - tween the wafer and the amorphous silicon layer, resulting in an improved open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of SHJ solar cells that can surpass 760 mV [12–14]. The ability of a-Si:H to provide exceptional passivation has been well established. The introduction of hydrogen atoms effec - tively neutralizes silicon dangling bonds on both a-Si:H thin films and c-Si surfaces [11]. This process reduces the gap states, which conse - quentially lowers the carrier recombination rate that is required for SHJ solar cells to achieve efficiencies above 26 % [5,6]. An optimal a-Si:H layer is typically formed by employing a deposition process that ensures both a high density and excellent quality of the a-Si:H layer [15]. It is also crucial to prevent epitaxial development at the interface between the c-Si bulk and a-Si:H layer, which is detrimental to solar cell per - formance [16]. Recently, several methods have been proposed to improve the surface passivation quality of a-Si:H, such as passivation using hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT), along with post-annealing of amorphous silicon [17–19]. However, another requirement for effective  *Corresponding author.

Since there is a tendency for high-quality amorphous silicon passivated surfaces to produce epitaxial layers (epilayers), there is a trade-off between interfacial passivation quality and epilayer suppression [22]. Relatively high deposition rates for amorphous silicon layers have been shown to pre - vent epilayer growth adjacent to the a-Si:H/c-Si interface [23]. The addition of this amorphous layer reduces the interface defect density (Dit) [24–26] by removing surface dangling bonds (DBs) [27] and keeping the dopant layer away from the c-Si surface due to the hydro - genation effect described earlier. It is well known that the substrate temperature during intrinsic amorphous silicon deposition is an important variable affecting film growth [28,29]. Ru et al. reported that an ultra-thin intrinsic a-Si:H buffer layer with a hydrogen content of 25.8 % was deposited on c-Si wafer surfaces using RF-PECVD at a temperature of 220  ◦ C, which improved the V oc  of SHJ solar cells due to the effective inhibition of epilayer formation [22]. Notably, the elevated deposition temperature limited the increase in the hydrogen content in the a-Si:H layer. Here, we propose a low-temperature procedure to deposit an anti-epitaxial i-a-Si: H buffer layer (I1 layer) prior to a dense i-a-Si:H bulk passivation layer (I2 layer) to form a bi-layer i-a-Si:H stack for optimizing the interfacial passivation quality of SHJ solar cells. The optical and structural prop - erties of the buffer layer were investigated by FTIR, and the impact of the buffer layer on carrier transport and collection was evaluated uti - lizing contact resistivity analysis. Finally, a buffer layer with 35.6 % hydrogen content and a 64.8 % microstructure factor was obtained at a substrate temperature of 160  ◦ C and a 0.45 nm/s deposition rate. As a result, the i-a-Si:H buffer layer with a lower substrate temperature and decelerated deposition rate improved the series resistance of the SHJ solar cells while maintaining a high V oc , resulting in an improvement of 0.21% abs  in the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) and a certi - fied PCE of 25.92 %, with a high open circuit voltage (V oc ) of 749.7 mV, on a full-area M6-size industry-grade silicon wafer. 2.Experimental details To assess the deposition rate and refractive index, I1 layers were first deposited on top of the non-tin surface of the bare glass. Since trial and error approaches for temperature adjustments can introduce errors, two independent process chambers were used for the I1 and I2 layers to ensure the stability of the process for the I2 layer at each time. After deposition, the thickness and refractive index (n) of the I1 layer were also defined by using a spectrum ellipsometer (SENTECH SE800PV). Another set of experiments was performed using RCA clean silicon wa - fers, where the passivation quality and microstructure of the I1 layer were investigated. The effective minority carrier lifetime (  ) was measured by a Sinton WCT-120 quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) system. The microstructure factor (R*) of the amorphous I1 layer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectros - copy. The physical significance of R* lies in the fact that it approximates the a-Si:H film as a two-phase system, with a densely structured amor - phous network in one phase and a network containing micropores in the other. The R* can be calculated as R*=(I 2080 )/(I 2000 +I 2080 ) based on the Gaussian formula, and the hydrogen content (C H ) was calculated as described by Ru [22]. The transfer length measurement (TLM) method with a contact array was applied to determine the contact resistivity (  c ) [30]. The current-voltage (I–V) characteristics were obtained by illu - minating the solar cell with I–V testers (IVT solar) under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G, 25  ◦ C). The SHJ solar cells were bifacial and fabricated on n-type M6-sized (274.5 cm 2 ) Czochralski (CZ) c-Si wafers with a thickness of 130   m and a resistivity of 0.3–2.1 ��cm. The wafer surfaces were first chemi - cally textured to obtain pyramids that were randomly distributed with a size of approximately 1–2   m. Then, the c-Si wafers were cleaned by modified RCA before amorphous layer deposition. Immediately thereafter, 6–8 nm thick i-a-Si:H layers were deposited on both sides of the clean wafers as the passivation layer. Then, 15–20 nm thick n-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiO x :H) layer and 20–30 nm thick p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) layer were deposited on the front and rear sides of the cells, respectively. All layers were deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) equipment, which was customized by Suzhou Maxwell Tech - nologies Corporation. Following this step, approximately 80–90 nm TCO layers were sputtered on both wafer surfaces. Finally, Ag finger grids on both sides of the cells were introduced by screen printing. Subsequently, the SHJ solar cells were annealed at 190  ◦ C for 20 min, and the average width of the fine line fingers was approximately 45   m. Fig. 1(a) shows the process flow diagrams of the SHJ solar cells fabricated using the rear single-layer and bi-layer i-a-Si:H processes. The structure of the SHJ solar cells fabricated using the rear bi-layer i-a-Si:H process is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). 3.Results and discussion The quality of the amorphous I layer was ascertained by modifying the PECVD process settings. To prevent the epitaxial reaction introduced by excess hydrogen gas in the experiment [31], a pure silane I1 pro - cedure (I1 layer) was utilized, wherein no more hydrogen gas was injected into the plasma reaction during the deposition process. The link between the PECVD power density and the refractive index of the film is shown in Fig. 2(a). As the power density increased, so did the deposition rate of the amorphous film. This was indicative of the fact that the silane had not yet reached a depletion state and was effectively involved in the reaction to ensure that SiH 4  sufficiently reacted in the plasma. The presence of silane plasma in the high-depletion region enhances the development of superior amorphous silicon layers [32], leading to improved passivation. The refractive index of the I1 layer decreased as the deposition rate increased. This result indicates that higher deposi - tion rates lower the density of the I1 layer, which makes the amorphous layer more suitable for contact with the I1 layer of the crystalline silicon surface. This in turn effectively reduces the formation of an epitaxial layer between the c-Si and I1 layers. Fig. 2(b) shows the trend of the refractive index of the film at different substrate deposition tempera - tures. As the process temperature increased, the deposition rate slightly increased, possibly due to the increase in the chamber temperature, which caused a minor increase in the collision capability of ions. It is worth mentioning that the refractive index of the film increases with increasing temperature, and the intrinsic amorphous silicon layer be - comes increasingly dense during the higher temperature process. The refractive index is found to be in the range of 3.5–4.1, with an additional n ranging from 3.5 to 3.8 compared to the power series. PECVD with a high ignition power is commonly used for the I1 layer to avoid epilayer formation [22,33], and the process temperature can be optimized to decrease the refractive index of the film [34]. It is possible to obtain a porous layer with a low refractive index without increasing the depo - sition rate, which is usually accompanied by a large amount of powder accumulation and poor film uniformity [35]. Next, the passivation ability of amorphous silicon was ascertained via the Sinton minority carrier test. Fig. 3(a) shows the minority carrier lifetime   eff  of the cell as a function of the density of excess carriers at different ignition powers and substrate temperatures for I1 layer depo - sition. A schematic diagram of the structure of the experimental samples is shown in Fig. 3(b). At the same 220  ◦ C deposition temperature, the I1 layer with a higher ignition power (850 W) has a higher minority carrier lifetime. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the pure I2 layer deposited at 220  ◦ C has insufficient passivation capability due to the epilayer growth itself and has the lowest minority carrier lifetime. When the I1 layer is utilized as an anti-epitaxial layer, the looser I1 layer can effectively facilitate the anti-epitaxial effect. As a result, the carriers of the 850 W group are better than those of the 700 W group due to the loose I1 layer. For groups with additional I1 layers, the use of a void-rich  C.-W. Peng et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 layer allows sufficient saturation of the a-Si:H/c-Si interface with high- density silicon dangling bonds. The I1 layer at the interface serves two purposes: first, it acts as a buffer layer to hinder epilayer growth at the a- Si:H/c-Si interface; second, it prevents the diffusion of H radicals from the H diluted plasma to the silicon interface by behaving as a protective layer. This diffusion is caused by the H dilution in the I2 layer of the high-quality layer, which is necessary for the growth of a dense i-a-Si:H layer for surface passivation [36].

Peng et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 temperatures on the I1 layer were examined, and it was found that the minority carrier lifetime is higher when a low-temperature I1 layer is utilized. For instance, the minority carrier lifetime at 140  � C and 160  � C was superior to that of the layer formed at 220  � C. A higher minority carrier lifetime at lower process temperatures seems to be counterintu - itive. This observation could be attributed to the use of a dual process chamber, which can effectively deposit the I1 and I2 layers at different temperatures in separate chambers. Hence, the relationship between the layers can be observed more accurately. Since lower deposition tem - peratures result in more porous and hydrogen-rich i-a-Si:H layers, this may lead to an increase in defects in the film, affecting the transport of charge carriers within the layer. An abundant hydrogen content can both promote epitaxial growth [31,37] and lead to lattice disorder, which affects the passivation capability of the i-a-Si:H layer. These two effects compete with each other to reach a balance [22,38]. Since the process temperature of the I layer generally falls in the range of 120–250  � C, it was expected that the I1 layers with a low refractive index deposited at low substrate temperature would have a good anti-epitaxial effect, but the passivation ability would be insufficient. However, since the low-temperature I1 layer is very loose, the anti-epitaxial growth ability of the c-S surface is greatly improved. When we further lowered the temperature of the I1 layer to 120  � C, there was a significant decrease in the passivation capability of the I layer itself. Although we enhanced the anti-epitaxial properties, it remains crucial to preserve the layer’s ability to provide effective passivation. Further - more, with the high-temperature process of the I2 layer, the overall I layer passivation ability reaches a maximum, resulting in an excellent passivation effect. The results indicate that a bi-layer i-a-Si:H stack composed of the I1 and I2 layers is necessary for achieving excellent passivation and that a looser I1 layer can enhance the passivation capability of the i-a-Si:H layer to increase the minority carrier lifetime. Therefore, the R* of the I1 layer was further analyzed by decomposing the Si–H stretching mode into Gaussian deconvolution [28,34] of the low stretching mode (LSM) and the high stretching mode (HSM), which are located at 2000 cm �1  and 2080 cm �1 , respectively, in the FTIR measurements [39]. At different deposition temperatures, a higher process temperature corre - sponds to a lower hydrogen content. This is ascribed to the escape of hydrogen due to high-temperature deposition conditions. In contrast, the low-temperature deposition of the film results in a sufficiently high hydrogen content [40,41]. A schematic diagram of the FTIR samples is shown in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 4 (b) shows the absorption bands associated with the Si–H stretching modes obtained by FTIR spectroscopy through the I1 layers on FZ (Float Zone) Si wafers with a total thickness of 200 nm by using different PECVD ignition powers. There are significant differences in the micro - structure between the film layers. As the ignition power increases from 400 W to 1150 W, HSM dominates in the less dense I1 layer, leading to a gradual increase in R* to 0.64. A high deposition rate of the I1 layer decreases the refractive index of the film. A low refractive index is also accompanied by a high HSM, which is mostly a SiH 2 -bonded structure. The SiH 2  bonded layer is more likely to be looser in the amorphous silicon layer. The R* and associated hydrogen content in the power experiments are listed in Table 1. The hydrogen content in the I1 layers is in the range of 26–37 %, making it a relatively hydrogen-rich silicon layer, with the highest hydrogen content in the 140  � C group. The substrate temperature change in the void-rich I1 layer is har - nessed, and differences in the microstructure between the film layers can be observed in both Fig. 4(c) and Table 1. As the substrate temperature decreases from 240  � C to 140  � C, R* increases from 50.9 to 71.8, indi - cating that the amorphous silicon film becomes less dense. This also corresponds to the refractive index of the single film in Fig. 2(b), which is 3.5 even at a low deposition temperature of 140  � C. Hence, the R* of i- a-Si:H can be effectively changed by modifying the deposition condi - tions. In Fig. 4(d), the I1 layer with a typical high temperature and high power (blue line) is selected and compared with that with a relatively low temperature and low power (red line). The R* of the I1 layer of the blue line group is similar to that of the conventional high-speed  Fig. 4.(a) Schematic diagram of FTIR samples deposited on the FZ c-Si wafer.

C.-W. Peng et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 deposition of the I1 layer (blue group), and the R* is higher. The R* can indicate whether the I1 layer is dense. However, when applied to solar cells, the effect of the layer on carrier transport needs to be considered. Carrier selectivity can be utilized to quantitatively describe the ability of a contact to collect one type of carrier. Since overall carrier transport is crucial in SHJ solar cells [42],   c  experiments were con - ducted to observe the effect of the buffer I1 layer. The conceptual dia - gram is shown in Fig. 5(a), while Fig. 5(b) shows a top view of the actual sample. The minority carrier lifetime (  ) and   c  of the I1 layer were measured, and the relationship between the transport of various hole carriers and the corresponding    for two series of i-a-Si:H layers (one is the power series with blue solid dots, and the other is the low-temperature series with red solid dots) was determined. The total thickness (I1þI2) of the i-a-Si:H layers was fixed at 7 nm, and the thicknesses of the I1 and I2 layers were 1.5 nm and 5.5 nm, respectively. From Table 1, it can be observed that increasing the power from 400 W to 1150 W at 220  � C lowered the refractive index of the I1 layer and worsened the film quality, which corresponds to better anti-epitaxial effectiveness. In the power series in Fig. 5(c) (blue solid dots),    in - creases from 1 ms at 700 W to 3.5 ms at 1100 W. However,   c  also in - creases to 100 m cm 2 , and    is approximately 3.5 ms when the whole I layer is relatively thin (7 nm). However, the problem that follows is the rapid increase in   c . The 850 W group reaches a relatively optimal bal - ance between passivation and carrier transport, with    ¼2.7 ms corre - sponding to a contact resistivity of 45 m cm 2 . By replacing the deposition temperature of the i-a-Si:H layers in the low-power group (red solid dots), the refractive index decreases significantly with decreasing deposition temperature, and increasing the hydrogen content of the film layer greatly improves the anti-epitaxial capability. The    of the sample at 700 W increases from 1 ms at 220  � C to 3.1 ms at 160  � C. This indicates that decreasing the deposition temperature improved the passivation effect. However, more defects at low temperatures lead to a significant increase in   c . Defects lead to a significant increase in   c , which seriously affects the collection and transport of holes. The carrier selectivity of passivated contacts in SHJ solar cells describes the ability of a contact to collect only one type of carrier, and good carrier selec - tivity is usually manifested by a lower   c  and higher   . The less desirable energetic position of defect states is the cause of impeded transport using a void-rich I1 layer, in conjunction with a potentially lower effective contact area of such void-rich films and the alteration of the induced band bending, which affects the hole density in the contact region [43]. The experimental results reveal that a trade-off exists between   c  and   , and better passivation results are usually achieved at the cost of a higher   c  in this mode of 11 þI2 structure passivation. The comparatively low-power low-temperature group achieves a reduced   c  while providing a longer hole carrier lifetime than the high-temperature group (solid blue dots in Fig. 5(c)). A thin, low-temperature, high-porosity I1 layer is joined to a thicker, low-porosity I2 layer. The low-temperature and low-speed change in the I1 microstructure results in an epitaxial layer, improving hole transport and achieving a better balance between transport and passivation. The scattered point values of the V oc , short-circuit current density (J sc ), filling factor (FF), series resistance (R s ), PCE, and pseudo fill factor (pFF) of the four groups of as-prepared SHJ solar cells are shown in Fig. 6 (a–e), and the corresponding average values of these electrical parameters are summarized in Table 2. The SHJ solar cells with buffer I1 layers deposited at 140  � C exhibited a maximum average V oc  of 750 mV, but the lowest average J sc  and FF. The low FF mostly arises from the contribution of low R s , specifically low   c . When the growth temperature of the I1 layer is increased to 220  � C, there is a noticeable reduction in the V oc . This reduction is attributed to the creation of an epilayer at the interface between a-Si and c-Si. The ignition power of the 220  � C group increases from 700 W to 850 W, resulting in a 2.4 mV increase in the V oc  from 746.4 mV to 748.8 mV. A higher deposition rate of the I1 anti- epilayer ensures excellent surface passivation while minimally impact - ing carrier transport, leading to a significant enhancement in the V oc . It is important to mention that the use of a high-quality film with high- temperature processing (refractive index ¼4.35) for the I2 layer in - creases the likelihood of epilayer development. Utilizing a low-speed and low-temperature I1 layer can effectively prevent the increase in interface defect density induced by the dense I2 layer during epitaxial growth, thereby enhancing the efficiency of solar cells. The optimal group of SHJ solar cells with an average PCE of 25.81 % was achieved by depositing an a-Si:H I1 layer at a rate of 0.45 nm/s at a temperature of 160  � C. A slight trade-off between high V oc  and FF is demonstrated at this temperature when a 1.5 nm I1 layer with a porous structure is uti - lized. To optimize high-performance solar cells, it is necessary to achieve  Table 1 Statistical data of R* and C H  with respect to the I1 layers as a function of power and substrate temperature.

Peng et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 superior surface passivation quality to minimize losses resulting from interface recombination. Additionally, it is crucial to employ a-Si:H thin films with minimal imperfections to avoid any interference with charge carrier collection. Ultimately, a bi-layer process, which was meticu - lously optimized to fulfill these two criteria, was implemented. It can be deduced that as the series resistance increases, the pseudo fill factor (pFF) increases, leading to a reduced leakage current. The variability in the FF is contingent upon the interplay between the R S  and pFF. Finally, the best solar cell has been officially certified to reach a PCE of 25.92 % (Fig. 7), making it a valuable asset for enhancing the overall efficiency of SHJ solar cells.

We investigated the impacts of the different buffer I1 layers on epitaxial growth and carrier transport, as well as the effects of substrate temperature and ignition power on the optical and structural properties of the buffer I1 layers. The findings suggest that placing a buffer I1 layer with a high hydrogen concentration and a low refractive index between c-Si and a dense a-Si:H layer can effectively inhibit epitaxial growth. Lowering the substrate temperature to 160  ◦ C resulted in a buffer I1 layer with 35.6 % hydrogen content and a 64.8 % microstructure factor at a deposition rate of 0.45 nm/s, in contrast to the high hydrogen content buffer layer achieved by increasing the power to increase the deposition rate. A greater hydrogen concentration prevented epitaxial growth and improved the interface passivation of the SHJ solar cells. Additionally, a lower deposition rate reduces the number of defects in the buffer I1 layer and greatly improves carrier transport and collection. By introducing an improved low- temperature buffer I1 layer, an improvement of 0.21% abs  in the average PCE and a certified PCE of 25.92 %, with a high open circuit voltage (V oc ) of 749.7 mV, is achieved on a full-area M6-size industry- grade silicon wafer. This work provides a reference for exploring further improvements in the interface passivation of SHJ solar cells.

Recently, we have proposed a quantum-well passivating contact (QWPC) that uses a quantum-well at the poly-Si/c-Si interface to suppress recombination, such as Auger and/or Shockley-Read- Hall recombination, due to deep dopant-diffusion problems from poly-Si into the c-Si absorber and, as a result, promote the passivation quality. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the QWPC in a large area (272.13 cm 2 ) of c-Si photovoltaic devices. A reference device, featuring a front boron diffusion emitter and normal rear poly-Si/c-Si passivating contact without QWPC, achieves a certified 22.99% conversion efficiency. The QWPC significantly reduces recombination losses within the device, as demonstrated by bias external quantum efficiency and dark I-V characteristics. The QWPC improves the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) by 20 mV. An antireflection magnesium fluoride coating applied at the front along with the QWPC improves the short-circuit current density by 1.27 mA/cm 2 . The QWPC device achieves a conversion efficiency of 23.91%. The QWPC demonstrates an innovative passivating contact for promoting c-Si solar cell performance.    1.Introduction The use of photovoltaic (PV) systems to convert solar energy into electricity is a feasible option for meeting rising global energy demand while minimising reliance on nonrenewable energy sources such as fossil fuels. The crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell has positioned itself as the market leader in photovoltaic devices due to its low cost and standardised commercial production technique. The objective of reducing commercial prices even further requires significant advance - ments in PV manufacturing technology and/or approaches to improve the efficiency of c-Si PV devices. In recent years, the silicon PV com - munity has been attracted to the passivating-contact and/or carrier- selective contact (CSC) approaches for boosting c-Si solar cell effi - ciency [1–4]. Polysilicon-based passivating contacts (hereinafter poly- Si) have a high potential for high stability and exceptional passivation quality, resulting in more than 26% of laboratory-scale c-Si devices [5,6]. Some major drawbacks remain, including as the need to retain highly doped poly-Si for efficient additional field-effect passivation (AFP) while minimising extensively deep dopant diffusion into the c-Si absorber during a high-temperature annealing step [7,8]. A shallow dopant in-diffusion to the host is necessary to provide the AFP. However, the excessive diffusion will cause significant recombination losses such as the Auger and/or Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, which degrades the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) parameter. As a result, an in-diffusion trade-off is needed. It requires substantial optimisation of the thermal- annealing process as well as doping concentration. Technological advancement is critical for promoting passivation contact and, as a result, cell performance. We recently reported on a quantum-well passivating contact (QWPC) that was inserted between the c-Si absorber and the poly-Si to improve passivation quality [9]. Massive dopant diffusion from the highly doped poly-Si into the absorber was efficiently restricted by the quantum well while retaining a tunnelling majority carrier transport. With a recom - bination current density (J o ) of 1.1 fA/cm 2  and an implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ) of 742 mV, remarkable passivation quality was achieved. This work demonstrates the efficacy of the QWPC on the rear of a large- area tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) device with a front boron-diffused selective emitter and a phosphorous-doped poly-Si rear  *Corresponding author.

The QWPC passivation quality improved open-circuit voltage (V oc ) by 20 mV. At the front, a magnesium fluoride (MgF 2 ) antireflection coating was employed to enhance short-circuit current density (J sc ), which enhanced J sc  by 1.27 mA/cm 2 . As a result, the constructed QWPC- TOPCon device achieved a 23.91% efficiency, which was 0.92% higher than that of a certified reference TOPCon device. Measurements of dark I-V (DIV) and bias external quantum efficiency (EQE) are used to get insight into the efficacy of QWPC within the devices. 2.Experimental details Fig. 1a and 1b depict the schematic TOPCon structures of a reference device and a QWPC device, respectively, whereas Fig. 1c depicts the device’s experimental progress. The devices were fabricated on an M6 (166-mm quasi-square) n-type Czochralski silicon wafer with resistivity ranging from 0.2 to 1 �cm. After completing conventional Radio Corporation of America wet chemical treatments including alkaline texturing and surface cleaning, the wafers were doped to form a boron- doped emitter (p �-emitter) in a boron diffusion furnace using BBr 3  gas precursor. The boron-doped zone at the back was removed by a single- side etching using a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid. The back surface was then thermally oxidised for 15 min at 700  � C to generate a 1.5-nm interfacial SiO x  layer. Following that, a highly phosphorous-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer (n �-a-Si:H) and a stack of 5-nm a-Si:H/1.5-nm SiO x /n �-a-Si:H were grown at the rear of the reference and QWPC devices, respectively, using a plasma- enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) system. After thermal annealing at 900  � C for 30 min in a rich-nitrogen environment, passiv - ating contacts were formed at the back of the reference (Fig. 1a) and QWPC (Fig. 1b) devices. Fig. 1b depicts QWPC with a single quantum well inserted between the poly-Si layer and the c-Si wafer. A narrow-gap nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) layer confined between two wide-gap thin SiO x  layers defines the single quantum well. A passivation stack of AlO x / SiN x  dielectric layers and a single SiN x  layer were formed on the front and back sides, respectively, after wet chemical etching and cleaning. Finally, the samples were screen-printed on both sides with grid-pattern 9-busbars, followed by a firing procedure at roughly 760  � C to entirely create metallization. Light I-V (LIV) curves and EQE were used to characterise the TOPCon devices after construction under conventional one-sun illumination (100 mW/cm 2 , AM1.5G, 25  � C). In a conventional dark room, dark I-V (DIV) curves were measured in a bias voltage range from �1 V to 1 V. 3.Results and discussions Fig. 2a shows the LIV data of the reference TOPCon device, which was measured independently at Fraunhofer ISE CalLab. Fig. 2b is a practical photograph of the TOPCon device. Fig. 2c and 2d show LIV and EQE data of the devices. A reference-device efficiency was 22.99%, including an V oc  of 695.3 mV, a J sc  of 40.62 mA/cm 2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 81.4%. The V oc  of the reference device was deteriorated to be less than 700 mV. V oc  degradation was probable due to extensive dopant diffusion from the highly doped poly-Si into the c-Si absorber [7] at the rear, along with recombination losses due to direct contact between metal and the c-Si absorber at the front. Based on dopant diffusion profiles, as shown in Fig. 3, we found that the diffused dopant concen - tration of a sample with the quantum well was lower than that of the reference. The dopant concentration was below 10 19  cm �3  at a distance of around 100 nm from the c-Si interface. The deep dopant diffusion caused a significant deterioration in AFP quality owing to insufficient isolation of the quasi-Fermi level, reducing band bending at the poly-Si/ c-Si interface [7,9]. As a result, the hole may facilitate tunnelling over the barrier and recombine with electrons at the interface. Extensive dopant diffusion increased the J o  at the interface while decreasing the contact resistivity (  c ) [9]. To minimise both J o  and   c , it is critical to suppress deep dopant diffusion while maintaining a highly doped poly- Si degree for efficient AFP. Fig. 4 shows cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of samples without (Fig. 4a) and with (Fig. 4b) the quantum well. The quantum-well structure with a nc-Si layer sandwiched between double SiO x  layers (~1.5 nm) at the poly-Si/c-Si interface, as shown in Fig. 4b, restricts diffusion due to the double SiO x  diffusion barrier, which can impede diffusion to a greater extent than the reference device’s single SiO x  barrier (Fig. 4a) [9]. Fig. 5a and 5b illustrate band diagrams for carrier collection at the rear of the reference and QWPC devices, respectively. It indicates that the nc-Si layer can serve as an intermediate conductive channel for carriers tunnelling through double thin SiO x  layers toward the collection. The optimal conditions and QWPC mechanism have been reported elsewhere [9]. As a result, as shown in Fig. 2c, the QWPC de - vice achieved a V oc  of 715.3 mV, which was 20 mV higher than that of the reference. As shown in Fig. 2d, the addition of a MgF 2  layer decreased reflectance losses at the front and raised the EQE of the QWPC  Fig. 1.Schematic diagram structures of the reference TOPcon device (a) and the QWPC device (b), and experimental procedure of the device (c).   D. Phong Pham et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           device, as compared to that of the reference. As a result, the J sc  of the QWPC device was 41.89 mA/cm 2 , which was about 1.27 mA/cm 2  higher than the reference. Based on the increases in V oc  and J sc , the QWPC device had a conversion performance of 23.91%, which was 0.92% greater than the reference device. To get insight into the quantum-well effect, the bias EQE approach was used on the devices. When a forward bias is applied to the device, which provides positive and negative voltages to the p-type doped and n-type doped sections, respectively, the internal electric field inside the device reduces significantly, restraining carrier transport to their col - lecting electrodes. In this case, the carrier transport is mostly hindered by recombination losses inside the device. A substantial decrease in the forward-bias EQE may indicate severe recombination losses inside the device. As a consequence, a forward-bias EQE ratio (EQE (0.5 V)/EQE (0 V)) less than one might reflect the degree of recombination inside a device [10,11]. A reverse bias, on the other hand, increases the internal electric field, which promotes carrier transport to their collecting elec - trodes. A significant increase in reverse-bias EQE may indicate a high level of recombination or defects inside a device. It means that providing the internal electric field of reverse-bias is expected to transport carriers massively over defect-traps within a device to their collecting electrodes. As a consequence, a considerable increase in the reverse-bias EQE ratio (EQE (-0.5 V)/EQE (0 V)) inside a device may indicate a high degree of recombination [12]. The forward- and reverse-bias EQE ratios of the devices are shown in Fig. 6a and 6b, respectively. The bias EQE mea - surements were performed on the QWPC device without the MgF 2  layer at the front for a more precise comparison. The QWPC device has a higher forward-bias EQE ratio than the reference, notably at long wavelengths (above 800 nm), which are absorbed mostly towards the back. It indicated that the QWPC device exhibited lower recombination and/or carrier collection losses than the reference device, particularly at the back. This was due to the quantum well significantly decreasing dopant diffusion into the c-Si absorber, hence enhancing the passivation quality at the back. In the wavelength range, the quantum-well device’s reverse-bias EQE ratio was lower than that of the reference, as shown in  Fig. 2.(a) LIV data of the reference device measured at Fraunhofer ISE CalLab, (b) real photo of the device at the front side, (c) LIV data, and (d) EQE data of the devices.

Phong Pham et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Fig. 6b. It proved that, when compared to the reference, the QWPC device minimised recombination losses within the device. Because the front structure of both devices was made the same way, recombination losses were thought to be concentrated on the back side because of dopant diffusion. To clarify the recombination losses further, DIV was studied as illustrated in Fig. 7. In DIV, the injected carrier concentration is mostly determined by the bias voltage applied, whereas recombination caused by defects within a device has an effect on the carrier concentration and/ or transportation. As a result, different current responses to various bias voltages may give additional information regarding recombination. The following equation expresses the relationship between dark current density (J) and bias voltage (V) in the device’s dark state: ��� 0 �exp������.� � �/�����1������.� � �/� �� �(1)  where q denotes the elementary charge, k the Boltzman constant, J 0  the reverse saturation current density, n the ideality diode factor, T the absolute temperature, R s  the series resistance, and R sh  the shunt resistance. Because R sh  is significantly greater than R s , the second component of the equation could be insignificant to the calculation and may therefore be removed. The derivative dV/dJ is represented as follows from the resultant equation (1): ��/���� � �����/��/��(2) Fig. 7a depicts plots of dV/dJ as a function of 1/J in the high bias region (V �0.6 (V)). In this region, the dark current is mainly deter - mined by the R s  variation [13,14]. Using equation (2), R s  values are derived from the intercepts of the plots. Fig. 7b shows the plotting log (J) as a function of (V-JR s ) using the R s  values derived from (2). Linear fittings of the plots (Fig. 7b) produce slop q/nkT and an intercept J 0 . The R s , n, and J 0  values of the devices are tabulated in the insets of Fig. 7a and 7b. Because the quantum well can suppress deep dopant diffusion, increasing contact resistance [9], the R s  of the QWPC device was slightly higher than that of the reference. As a result, the FF of the QWPC device was slightly lower than that of the reference, as shown in Fig. 2. The reference device’s n value was closer to 2, indicating that the recombi - nation current dominated the device’s conduction mechanism [15]. The recombination could be caused mainly by deep dopant diffusion from the poly-Si into the absorber. The n value of the QWPC device, on the other hand, was closer to unity, indicating that the diffusion current seems to dominate inside the device [16]. Furthermore, the QWPC de - vice’s J 0  was much lower than that of the reference. This means that the quantum-well device significantly decreases recombination losses inside the device. Deep dopant diffusion may be responsible for the change of the conduction mechanism from recombination of the reference device to the diffusion current mechanism of the quantum-well device. Diffu - sion might produce considerable recombination along the poly-Si/c-Si interface, increasing the n and J 0  parameters of the reference device. The recombination current model in the dark condition is vitally defined  Fig. 4.Cross-sectional HRTEM images of poly-Si passivating contacts a) without and b) with the quantum well at the poly-Si/c-Si interface.   Fig. 5.Band diagram for carrier collection at the rear of a) the reference and b) QWPC devices.   D. Phong Pham et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           at the depletion zone and/or the space charge region in an ideal p-n junction model. However, in a real device, the recombination model seems to be more complicated owing to the existence of various addi - tional components, such as surface recombination and/or other semi - conductor/metal contacts, which may have a major influence on n and J 0 . Some researchers believe that the recombination model is susceptible to interfacial defects or recombination [17,18]. As a result, the change in the conduction mechanism may be explained by lowering the recom - bination losses caused by the quantum-well at the poly-Si/c-Si interface. 4.Conclusion The effectiveness of QWPC at the poly-Si/c-Si interface was demonstrated in the large-area TOPCon devices. The purpose of the QWPC was to suppress the massive dopant diffusion from the poly-Si into the c-Si due to the double SiO x  barriers, resulting in improved passivation quality and, as a result, V oc . The QWPC device showed a 20 mV higher V oc  than the reference. The bias EQE technique demonstrated that the QWPC device significantly reduced the recombination losses within the device, especially at the rear region of the device, compared with the reference. The DIV results demonstrated that the conductivity mechanism changed from the recombination of the reference device into the diffusion currents of the QWPC device. Furthermore, n factors sug - gested that surface recombination was primary in the reference device’s recombination losses. As a result, the QWPC was an innovative tech - nique to suppress the recombination losses at the surface of TOPCon devices.

Its incorporation into specialized solar cell technol - ogy, such as Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) cells, aims to enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion [1]. TOPCon cells are meticulously designed with specialized passivation techniques, featuring contacts on both front and rear sides to curtail recombination losses of charge carriers and minimize energy losses. Hafnium oxide (HfO2) is increasingly favoured in TOPCon solar cells due to its advantageous material properties. With a higher dielectric constant than silicon oxide (SiO2), HfO2 enhances passivation and fosters efficient charge carrier separation, essential for minimizing recombination losses [2]. Additionally, HfO2’s robustness at elevated temperatures bolsters the cells’ endurance and performance over time. This attribute signifi - cantly boosts cell efficiency.

A detailed study utilizing ATLAS Silvaco simulation software has underscored the potential of optimized HfO2 layers to markedly improve the performance of TOPCon solar cells. Through meticulous simulation, it has been established that the strategic incorporation of HfO2 can lead to a 21.3% increase in charge carrier lifetime, with the possibility of boosting the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) by up to 25%. This discovery significantly delineates our work from foun - dational literature. HfO2’s superior material properties, notably its higher dielectric constant compared to silicon oxide (SiO2) and its remarkable thermal stability, are well documented in broader scientific discourse. These attributes render HfO2 an ideal candidate for applica - tion in advanced solar cell technologies (see Table 1, Fig. 1). Moreover, the research elucidates how HfO2’s broader bandgap effectively minimizes unnecessary light absorption, thereby optimizing the photon-to-electricity conversion process. Such findings, derived from simulation results, highlight HfO2’s capability to enhance the interface quality with silicon, which in turn could substantially augment the performance and longevity of TOPCon solar cells. The novelty of this research lies in its predictive analysis, achieved through comprehensive simulations, which project HfO2’s impactful role in improving TOPCon solar cell efficiency. This approach not only leverages the existing literature on HfO2’s material advantages but also builds upon previous experimental findings to offer a forward-looking perspective on the application of HfO2 in solar cell technology. The study advocates for subsequent experimental validation of the simulation outcomes, further refinement of interface engineering techniques, and exploration of the scalability of HfO2’s application in the manufacturing of TOPCon solar cells. This fusion of novel findings with established scholarly work fur - nishes a robust framework for understanding the benefits of incorpo - rating HfO2 into TOPCon solar cells. It propels the narrative beyond theoretical speculation, suggesting tangible advancements in the effi - ciency of solar cell technology. Future research directions, as proposed, will not only validate these promising simulations but also pave the way for the practical realization of higher-efficiency, durable solar cells, marking a significant stride towards achieving global sustainable energy goals. Hafnium oxide (HfO2) is being explored as a superior alternative to silicon oxide (SiO2) in the manufacturing of TOPCon solar cells. The stability of HfO2 under thermal and chemical stress contributes to the cells’ longevity [13]. These attributes suggest HfO2’s potential to improve interface quality with silicon, promising a significant boost in the performance and durability of TOPCon solar cells. Diagrams illus - trating TOPCon cells with silicon dioxide (SiO2) and HfO2 layers highlight their structural variances and potential influences on cell performance. These cells employ a thin insulating layer known as “Tunnel Oxide,” comprising materials like SiO2 or HfO2, to passivate the silicon surface and facilitate charge carrier mobility for improved efficiency. Rear-side contacts in TOPCon cells optimize light absorption, diminishing shading losses and enhancing overall performance compared to conventional designs. HfO2 possesses properties conducive to effective passivation, making it an appealing substitute for SiO2. Computational simulations project its potential superiority in reducing surface recombination [4]. Investigating HfO2 involves examining its physical, chemical, and electrical properties, employing advanced computational tools, and validating findings experimentally to evaluate its impact on TOPCon cell performance. Challenges encompass optimizing HfO2 properties, ensuring stability within the HfO2-silicon interface, scalability in manufacturing, and transitioning laboratory achievements to practical applications [5]. The research focuses on the investigation of hafnium oxide (HfO2) within Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells, emphasizing its significant potential to enhance the performance and efficiency of these cells. Hafnium oxide’s selection for this research is highlighted due to its superior material properties compared to silicon oxide (SiO2), such as a higher dielectric constant and thermal stability, which contribute to better passivation and efficient charge carrier sep - aration. While the research outlines the advantages of HfO2 and its role in improving TOPCon solar cell performance, including a predicted in - crease in charge carrier lifetime and power conversion efficiency, it compares HfO2 to SiO2 to establish a benchmark for improvement. SiO2 is traditionally used in solar cell technologies for surface passivation to reduce recombination losses. However, HfO2’s higher dielectric con - stant and thermal stability make it an appealing alternative, offering the potential for better performance and durability under operational con - ditions. The explicit rationale for discussing SiO2 alongside HfO2 lies in providing a comparative framework that highlights HfO2’s advance - ments over traditional materials like SiO2. This comparison is crucial for understanding the extent of improvement and innovation that HfO2 introduces to the field of solar cell technology. Although the research thoroughly discusses the benefits and potential of HfO2, direct elabo - ration on the choice to discuss SiO2, beyond its role as a comparative material, might not be explicitly detailed in the provided sections. The comparison to SiO2 serves as a baseline to emphasize the improvements and potential benefits offered by HfO2, such as enhanced passivation capabilities and operational stability, which are critical for advancing solar cell technologies and achieving higher efficiencies. The term “optimizing HfO2 properties” denotes the process of methodically adjusting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hafnium oxide layer within solar cells to maximize its role in passivation. This opti - mization process may involve calibrating the layer’s thickness, altering its dielectric constant for improved electrical insulation, and ensuring its bandgap effectively complements the silicon substrate to optimize the cell’s operational efficiency. These modifications are geared towards enhancing the solar cell’s electrical performance, targeting a reduction in the recombination of charge carriers and an increase in the cell’s overall energy conversion efficiency. The exploration aims to drive progress in materials science and engineering strategies, fostering more efficient solar energy conversion technologies. The introduction con - textualizes the significance of exploring HfO2 within solar cell tech - nology, emphasizing its inherent properties and potential to enhance efficiency. It delineates research methodologies, parameters, and ex - pected contributions, laying the groundwork for subsequent in - vestigations within the research paper. In this research, a meticulous comparative analysis of hafnium oxide (HfO2) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) within the framework of Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells is presented. The study metic - ulously employs ATLAS Silvaco simulation software to underscore the enhanced performance attributes of HfO2 over SiO2, particularly noting a substantial improvement in charge carrier lifetime and overall power conversion efficiency attributed to the optimization of HfO2 layers. The simulations predict a notable 21.3% increase in charge carrier lifetime and a potential boost in power conversion efficiency of up to 25% using HfO2, setting this work apart from existing literature by highlighting the precision of simulation techniques and specific quantitative advance - ments discerned. This research illuminates the superior material prop - erties of HfO2, such as its higher dielectric constant relative to SiO2 and its exceptional thermal stability, which significantly contribute to its  Table 1 Simulated Parameters for TOPCon [27], The various materials in the table are distinguished by their unique electrical properties, which impact their perfor - mance in a solar cell [30]. For example, HfO2 stands out with its high relative permittivity and distinct electron tunnel mass, suggesting it may offer enhanced passivation effects [31–33]. These attributes are critical for predicting how each material influences electron tunneling efficiency and the overall effectiveness of the cell’s passivation layer [28].

The broader bandgap of HfO2, which reduces unnecessary light absorption and thus optimizes the photon-to-electricity conversion process, is identified as a crucial per - formance determinant. These characteristics, coupled with the findings from the simulations, suggest HfO2’s potential to markedly improve the interface quality with silicon, thereby enhancing both the performance and longevity of TOPCon solar cells. In this research, we are deeply rooted in predictive analysis through ATLAS Silvaco simulations, rep - resenting a considerable progression beyond the broader literature that has largely focused on the theoretical benefits and material properties of HfO2. The study advocates for subsequent experimental validation of these simulation results, further refinement of the HfO2-silicon inter - face, and exploration of the scalability of HfO2’s application in the manufacturing processes of TOPCon solar cells. This thorough investi - gation effectively bridges the theoretical underpinnings of material science with practical applications in solar technology, providing a solid framework for the integration of HfO2 in TOPCon solar cells and her - alding significant advancements in the efficiency of solar cell technology. 2.Historical development and evolution of TOPCon solar cells The historical progression of Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells has marked a significant journey in solar cell technology, aimed at enhancing efficiency and performance. The evo - lution of TOPCon cells has seen distinct phases, starting with the emergence of passivating contacts to mitigate recombination losses at the semiconductor surface, leading to the conception of TOPCon solar cell concepts [6]. Subsequent stages witnessed the emergence of initial prototypes featuring rear-side passivated contacts, optimizing the cell’s structure to reduce surface recombination and bolster overall efficiency. Advancements focused on refining design and manufacturing processes, emphasizing passivation layer optimization, surface passivation quality enhancement, and improved carrier transport for heightened efficiency [7]. Transitioning from laboratory-scale development to industrial production became a focal point, with efforts to adapt TOPCon tech - nology to commercial-scale manufacturing processes. Presently, ongoing research continues to refine TOPCon technology, emphasizing enhanced passivation techniques, material optimization, and innovative architectures for increased efficiency and scalability in large-scale pro - duction. The latest developments have showcased competitive effi - ciencies in TOPCon solar cells compared to conventional technologies, positioning them as a viable option for high-efficiency solar devices [8]. TOPCon solar cell devices generally achieve a marked increase in efficiency over traditional solar technologies. These innovative cells often surpass the typical 15%–20% efficiency range of conventional cells, with some reports indicating efficiencies over 21.3%. This notable advancement is attributed to sophisticated passivation techniques and enhancements in the cells’ electrical properties. The extent of perfor - mance improvement provided by TOPCon technology varies, depending on the baseline efficiencies of the solar cells to which they are compared. This historical evolution from inception to refinement underscores TOPCon technology’s potential to revolutionize solar cell efficiency, significantly contributing to advancing renewable energy solutions. The band structure of n-type and p-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells plays a crucial role in understanding their elec - tronic characteristics and charge carrier behavior [9]. It delineates en - ergy levels within semiconductor materials, dictating the cell’s efficiency in converting solar energy into electrical power. In n-type cells, the conduction band accommodates electrons for free movement, while the valence band remains mostly unoccupied. Photons excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, contributing to the cell’s current flow [10]. Conversely, p-type cells exhibit a valence band predominantly occupied by holes, while the conduction band remains mostly unoccupied. Photon absorption gen - erates electron-hole pairs, leading to current flow through hole move - ment. In the evolving landscape of photovoltaic technology, p-type doping continues to play a pivotal role, underscored by its cost-effectiveness and the maturity of manufacturing techniques. Despite the burgeoning interest in n-type materials, attributed to their superior efficiency and reduced degradation phenomena, p-type silicon retains its relevance within the industry. This persistence is largely due to optimized production processes and substantial infrastructural in - vestments. Nonetheless, the shift towards advanced n-type technologies such as TOPCon and HJT cells heralds a transformative phase in solar cell manufacturing, driven by the pursuit of higher performance metrics. The ongoing development and optimization of p-type cell technologies, aimed at enhancing efficiency through innovative passivation tech - niques, illustrate the dynamic interplay between cost, efficiency, and technological maturity in dictating industry trends. Modifications in the band structure, particularly via passivation layers like hafnium oxide (HfO2) or silicon dioxide (SiO2), significantly impact energy levels and charge carrier behavior, reducing surface recombination and enhancing electrical performance [11]. Understanding the band structure of TOP - Con cells is crucial for developing strategies to optimize efficiency, diminish recombination losses, and maximize solar energy conversion. Continuous exploration and refinement of band engineering techniques are pivotal for advancing TOPCon cell technology towards greater effi - ciencies and broader commercial applications in renewable energy contexts [12].

By using ATLAS Silvaco, silicon dioxide (SiO2) and hafnium oxide (HfO2) stand as pivotal ma - terials, each renowned for distinct optical attributes [13]. Silicon Di - oxide (SiO2). Widely known as silica, SiO2 finds extensive use across optics, electronics, and multiple sectors. Its refractive index spans approximately 1.44–1.46 for visible light wavelengths (around 550 nm), contingent on factors like preparation method, purity, and temperature. Amorphous SiO2, prevalent in thin film coatings and integrated circuits, leans toward the lower end of this range, while crystalline forms, like quartz, exhibit slightly higher refractive indices. SiO2’s refractive index diminishes with increasing light wavelengths. Hafnium oxide, or HfO2, boasts notable optical traits prized for its high dielectric constant, thermal stability, and potential in diverse electronic and optical appli - cations. Its refractive index surpasses SiO2 significantly, ranging from 1.9 to 2.1 for visible light wavelengths, markedly higher than SiO2 see Fig. 3. This higher refractive index enhances its utility in optical coat - ings, semiconductor devices, nanophononics, and photonic applications, favouring scenarios requiring augmented light-matter interaction, effective light confinement, or optical waveguiding [34]. These refrac - tive index values are approximate and can fluctuate based on material composition, structure, and measurement conditions [35]. Accurate refractive index measurements often demand sophisticated techniques such as ellipsometry, spectroscopic methods, or interferometry [14]. The figure suggests that the refractive index of HfO����decreases with increasing wavelength, a relationship that’s valuable for understanding and optimizing the material’s behavior in photovoltaic applications. The refractive index of HfO����and SiO2 with a thickness of 1.2 nm across various wavelengths by using the Simulation tool. At this nano- scale thickness, HfO��’s optical properties, such as its refractive index, are critical for its function in solar cells, where it can influence light absorption and electrical performance [15]. These values crucially shape the design and engineering of optical devices, coatings, and semiconductor technologies, influencing light’s behavior within these materials and informing their applications. ATLAS Silvaco simulation software helps predict how the inclusion of HfO2 layers can improve charge carrier lifetime by 21.3%, which could lead to a substantial in - crease in overall power conversion efficiency by up to 25%. The research suggests that HfO2 enhances the passivation of the silicon surface, which is crucial for efficient charge carrier separation, a key factor in reducing recombination losses. Furthermore, the study outlines the potential superiority of HfO2 in reducing surface recombination, which is backed by simulations that project HfO2’s beneficial impact on the solar cell’s electric field, thus affecting charge separation and cell efficiency. The simulations are based on the comparison of TOPCon solar cells with SiO2 and HfO2 passivation layers, analyzing various efficiencies, carrier lifetimes, and surface recombination rates. For SiO2, the refractive index decreases slightly as the wavelength increases, indicating a typical dispersion relationship where the material is less optically dense at higher wavelengths. In comparison, HfO2 shows a more pronounced decrease in refractive index with increasing wave - length. Both plots exhibit that the materials have higher refractive indices at shorter wavelengths and lower indices at longer wavelengths, which is consistent with normal dispersion behavior in dielectric ma - terials. In the realm of photovoltaic research, particularly focusing on the advancement of Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells, the determination of refractive index values for SiO2 and HfO2 layers presents a critical aspect of understanding and optimizing mate - rial properties for enhanced cell efficiency. Utilizing the ATLAS Silvaco simulation software, a comprehensive methodology was employed to accurately model these values, incorporating detailed geometrical con - figurations of the solar cell, intrinsic material parameters, and varying optical properties across the relevant wavelength ranges. This simula - tion effort was underscored by the objective to assess the impact of these refractive indices on the solar cell’s light absorption, charge carrier generation, and overall efficiency. To ensure the reproducibility and validity of our findings, the simulation parameters, including the structure definition, material properties, boundary conditions, and light source configuration, were meticulously documented. 3.2.Simulation of TOPCon solar cell for SiO2 and HfO2 passivated layer The simulation of Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells incorporating silicon dioxide (SiO2) and hafnium oxide (HfO2) passivation layers through ATLAS Silvaco involves a detailed setup of the solar cell structure to analyze its behavior comprehensively. Choosing ATLAS Silvaco for simulations in solar cell research is informed by its detailed semiconductor modeling capabilities. ATLAS excels in simulating complex semiconductor behaviors, crucial for analyzing solar cell dynamics. Its proficiency in modeling both the electrical and optical characteristics of various materials makes it an invaluable tool for examining the effects of different layers, such as HfO2, on the performance of TOPCon solar cells [16]. The software’s diverse material compatibility allows for nuanced optimization studies, essential for enhancing solar cell efficiency. The process is initiated by defining the solar cell structure, specifying the silicon substrate, emitter layers, metal contacts, and pivotal passivation layers (SiO2 and HfO2)  Fig. 2.The figure showcases the energy band structures in TOPCon solar cells with n-type and p-type doping. In the left panel (a), the n-type configuration is presented, highlighted by the presence of electrons as majority charge carriers, while the right panel (b) displays the p-type setup, where holes predominate. The dashed lines demarcate the conduction and valence bands, with the placement of the Fermi level influenced by the doping type.  R.U. Rahman et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              on both the top and bottom interfaces of the silicon wafer. Accurate modeling of the material properties, including dielectric constants, refractive indices, and interface charges, is imperative to portray their interactions realistically [36]. Interface configuration detailing, such as specifying interface traps and defect densities, is crucial for accurately representing the interactions between passivation layers and the silicon substrate, aiming to simulate reduced recombination rates and improved carrier lifetime. The simulation also encompasses electrical and optical properties modeling within the passivation layers, ac - counting for carrier transport, recombination mechanisms, and light transmission, aiding in optimizing light trapping efficiency and photon-to-electron conversion [17]. ATLAS Silvaco facilitates the simulation of carrier transport and recombination mechanisms, which is essential for understanding how passivation layers affect carrier dynamics [18]. Post-simulation analysis involves critical device parameter assessment and optimization to enhance performance. Comparing simulated results between SiO2 and HfO2 passivated TOPCon solar cells enables a comprehensive evaluation of their efficiencies, carrier lifetime, and surface recombination rates. This simulation process empowers researchers and engineers to thor - oughly analyze and optimize solar cell performance, driving the devel - opment of more efficient and advanced photovoltaic devices by understanding the influence of various passivation materials. In solar cell technology, HfO2’s fixed charges play a pivotal role [40]. Positively charged HfO2 can enhance silicon surface passivation, reducing recombination losses and boosting cell output [19]. These inherent charges in the HfO2 layer impact the solar cell’s electric field, affecting charge separation and cell efficiency. Research into these charges aims to refine the passivation layer, optimizing solar cell effi - ciency [38,39]. Simulating Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells with different passivation layers, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) and hafnium oxide (HfO2), involves intricate computational models to predict and analyze the cell’s behavior and performance [20]. These simulations play a pivotal role in understanding how these layers influence the overall efficiency and functionality of the solar cell. 3.3.Simulation of SiO2 passivated TOPCon solar cell In the simulation of a TOPCon solar cell with a SiO2 passivation layer, various parameters are considered. The SiO2 layer’s thickness, refractive index, and electrical properties are modeled to determine their impact on the cell’s performance. The simulation involves modeling the band structure, carrier transport, recombination rates, and optical properties, among other factors [21]. Parameters such as the interface quality between SiO2 and silicon, surface recombination ve - locities, and charge carrier lifetimes are critical aspects evaluated through the simulation. The simulation aims to predict how SiO2 in - fluences the band alignment at the SiO2-Silicon interface, its effect on carrier transportation, and the reduction of recombination losses [22]. It also assesses the optical properties, light absorption, and transmission characteristics of the SiO2 layer to optimize its thickness for improved light trapping and photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (Fig. 4). Each layer’s color corresponds to a different material, as noted in the legend, with specific attention to the placement and role of SiO 2  in passivating the cell structure to improve efficiency by reducing recom - bination losses. However, without specific scale indicators or thick - nesses, it is difficult to discern the exact proportions of each layer in the simulation. 3.4.Simulation of HfO2 passivated TOPCon solar cell Similarly, in simulating a TOPCon solar cell with an HfO2 passiv - ation layer, the computational model considers different parameters specific to HfO2. These include the HfO2 layer’s thickness, refractive index, band alignment with silicon, electrical characteristics, and its impact on carrier transport and recombination rates [23]. The simula - tion aims to understand how the higher refractive index of HfO2 in - fluences light confinement and absorption within the cell [24]. It also evaluates how HfO2 mitigates recombination losses at the silicon sur - face, improving charge carrier lifetime and enhancing overall efficiency. Parameters like the quality of the HfO2-Silicon interface, interface traps, and the impact of HfO2 on carrier mobility and lifetime are analyzed in detail (Fig. 5). The color coding corresponds to different materials, as explained in the legend, indicating the presence and order of various materials such as silicon nitride (SiN 4 ), polysilicon, silicon (Si), HfO 2 , silver, and aluminum. These diagrams are critical for visualizing the design and understanding how each layer contributes to the cell’s functionality, particularly focusing on the role of HfO 2  in enhancing the cell’s effi - ciency. Comparing the simulation results of SiO2 and HfO2 passivated TOPCon solar cells helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each material [25]. It allows for optimizing parameters like layer thickness, interface quality, and electrical properties to achieve the highest efficiency. It also aids in identifying the material that provides superior passivation, reduced recombination losses, and enhanced light trapping, essential for improving solar cell performance.

In the SiO2-based TOPCon energy band diagram, SiO2 acts as the passivation layer on the silicon substrate. The valence band (VB) represents the highest energy level occupied by electrons, while the conduction band (CB) indicates the lowest energy level for electron conductivity [29]. SiO2’s bandgap sits between the VB and CB, influencing charge carrier movement, while possible interface traps or defects in SiO2 may affect carrier dynamics, particularly surface recombination rates [37]. In the HfO2-based TOP - Con energy band diagram, HfO2’s unique band structure and bandgap  Fig. 4.The figure appears to display simulated structures for a Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cell with a Silicon Dioxide (SiO 2 ) passivated layer.

R.U. Rahman et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              between VB and CB differentiate it from SiO2, influencing carrier transport differently [41]. The energy levels at the HfO2-silicon inter - face play a critical role in carrier recombination and transport [42]. These diagrams help us understand how passivation layers impact charge carrier behavior, band bending, and recombination mechanisms, essential for engineers and researchers to optimize solar cell designs and improve solar energy conversion efficiency (Fig. 6). The J�V (current-voltage) characteristics play a pivotal role in evaluating the operational efficiency and potential of solar cells, particularly those of the TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) type. These metrics offer crucial insights into the solar cell’s perfor - mance under varying operational conditions, offering critical data on its efficiency and power output. Efficiency stands as a key metric, show - casing a solar cell’s capability to convert incident light into useable electrical energy. An efficiency rating of 21.23 % signifies that approx - imately 21.23 % of the incoming sunlight is effectively transformed into electrical power. Short-circuit current Density (Jsc), measured at 43.57 mA/cm2, denotes the maximum current density produced by the solar cell under standard conditions without an external voltage applied in Fig. 7. A higher Jsc signifies superior absorption of incident photons and the generation of more electron-hole pairs within the efficiency of the cell’s power conversion. This value signifies the squareness of the J�V curve, reflecting the efficiency and minimizing energy losses within the cell during power conversion. Open-circuit voltage (V oc ), rated at 602 mV, indicates the maximum voltage achieved across the solar cell when no current flows through it. V oc  is influenced by various factors, including carrier recombination and extraction. The J�V curve of a TOPCon solar cell typically displays a high Jsc and V oc  alongside a high FF, showcasing the relationship between generated current and applied voltage, especially under illumination. Achieving these characteristics in TOPCon cells often involves optimizing passivation layers, reducing recombination losses, improving carrier extraction, and refining the materials and interfaces within the solar cell structure. Overall, these metrics affirm the high performance and efficiency of the investigated  Fig. 7.The figure presents current-voltage (J–V) characteristics of TOPCon solar cells with different passivation layers.

It maps the energy levels across p-type polysilicon, silicon dioxide, and n-type polysilicon on an n-type crystalline silicon substrate. The bands displayed are critical for visualizing electron behavior in the material conduction band (E C ) for electrons, the valence band (E V ) for holes, and the Fermi level (E F ), which represents the chemical potential for electrons. Understanding this diagram is fundamental to semiconductor device design, as it relates to charge distribution and movement at the junctions of different materials. Fig. b) represents an energy band diagram for a layered semiconductor structure, detailing the arrangement of p-type polysilicon, aluminium, n-type crystalline silicon, and n-type polysilicon, capped with an HfO 2  layer. It highlights the energy bands critical for semiconductors: the conduction band, valence band, and Fermi level. This visualization is key in semiconductor design, offering insights into potential barriers and electronic behavior that dictate the performance of the device.  R.U. Rahman et al.

The HfO2 layer exhibits a slightly higher Jsc and efficiency, suggesting improved performance over the SiO2 layer in this simulation. HfO2’s advantageous attributes for passivation in TOPCon solar cells are increasingly recognized. Its elevated dielectric constant amplifies the internal electric field, fostering superior carrier separation and dimin - ished recombination activities, which potentially heightens the open- circuit voltage (Voc). Furthermore, the broader bandgap of HfO2 may enhance the cell’s optical performance by decreasing parasitic light absorption, offering a path to a greater short-circuit current density (Jsc). These improvements could synergistically elevate the overall ef - ficiency of TOPCon cells, suggesting that HfO2 is a promising substitute for traditional SiO2 layers. 4.Conclusion In conclusion, the exploration of Hafnium oxide (HfO2) within Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cells stands as a crucial endeavour in advancing solar energy technologies.

II.M ODELINGOFTHE IV C HARACTERISTIC A.GeneralApproach Todeterminethemaximumefﬁciencyofsiliconsolarcells limitedbytheintrinsicpropertiesofsilicon,wefollowtheap- proachofpreviouspublicationsinmodelingidealcellswithout surfaceanddefectrecombination,aswellasperfectfront-side antireﬂectioncoatingsandperfectreﬂectingrearmirrors[4], [6],[20].Indoingso,wedonotconsideranyefﬁciencyen- hancementassociatedwithimpuritybands,improvedinternal conﬁnementduetoquantumstructures,orspectrum-shifting(up ordownconversion).Thecurrent–voltagecharacteristicofsuch anidealcellcanbeexpressedas J = J L − qWR intr (1) where J L isthecurrentdensitythatisgeneratedbytheincident light, W thecellthickness, R intr theintrinsicrecombination rate(radiativeandAugerrecombination),and q theelementary charge.Theintrinsicbulklifetimeofsilicon τ intr and,conse- quently,also R intr =∆ n / τ intr isanexplicitfunctionofthe excesscarrierconcentration ∆ n .Undertheassumptionofa “narrowbase,”thechangeofthequasi-Fermilevelswithinthe baseisverysmall,andthequasi-Fermilevelseparationcanbe consideredtobeconstant[3].Whenassumingadditionallyideal contacts,thequasi-Fermilevelseparationequalsthecellsoutput voltage V ,andthus, ∆ n isrelatedto V by[3],[4] np =( n 0 +∆ n )( p 0 +∆ n )= n 2 i , eﬀ exp  qV k B T  (2) withtheelectronandholeconcentrations n and p ,therespective equilibriumconcentrations n 0 and p 0 ,theBoltzmannconstant k B ,andthetemperature T .Thisrelationisusedtodetermine ∆ n ( V,n 0 ,p 0 )for R intr ( n 0 ,p 0 , ∆ n ) in(1).Actually,(1)isalso basedonthenarrowbaseassumptionasitimpliesaconstant recombinationratethroughoutthecell,whichisfulﬁlledifthe quasi-Fermilevelsareconstant.Itshouldbementionedthatby modelingthe IV characteristicwith(1),weassumeinaddition toidealcontactsalsonegligibleseriesresistancelossesarising fromthechargecarriertransportwithinthesiliconbulk.Obvi- ously,thisisagoodassumptionforcellsmadeofhighlydoped silicon.However,itisalsoagoodassumptionforcellsmadeof lowlydopedsilicon,astheseareinsufﬁcienthighinjectionat maximumpowerpoint(mpp)(cf.,SectionIII-B). B.Photogeneration Theabsorbedcurrentdensity J L wascalculatedassumingthat everyphotonabsorptioneventgeneratesasingleelectron–hole pair.Thecreationofmultipleelectron–holepairsbyhigh-energy photons[21]wasneglected,asitisaquitesmalleffect,con- tributinglessthan0.1mA/cm 2 [20],[22].Further,aLambertian randomizinglight-trappingschemetogetherwithanisotropic responseofthecellwasassumed,whichresultsinanincreased meanpathlengthforalightrayinsidethecellof 4 n 2 r W ,where n r istherefractiveindexofsilicon[4].Theweaklyabsorbed subbandgapphotonshavealsoacertainprobabilityofbeingab- sorbedbyfreecarriers.TakingthisparasiticFCAintoaccount, J L canbedeterminedfrom J L = q  ∞ 0 A bb ( E )Φ( E ) dE (3) withthespectrallyresolvedrelativeabsorbanceinthecell[4] A bb ( E )= α bb ( E ) α bb ( E )+ α FCA ( E )+ 1 4 n 2 r W (4) thesolarspectrum Φ normalizedtoanintensityof0.1W/cm 2 , andtheabsorptioncoefﬁcientsforband-to-bandtransitionsand FCA, α bb and α FCA ,bothasafunctionofthephotonenergy E .

[6],which results,forinstance,ina12%higher P PR for W = 100 µ m (cf.,Fig.6intheAppendix).Thespectraldependenceofthe spontaneousemission B ( E ) ,asrequiredtodetermine P PR , wascalculatedfromthegeneralizedPlanckequation,whichis anextendedformofthevanRoosbroeckequation[8],[25].

Second,theopticalpropertiesofsilicon[28]werereplacedby themorerecentlypublishedself-consistentdatasetof[13].By comparingrowCwiththepreviousrowB,noconsiderableeffect ontheefﬁciency( + 0.02%-abs.)isobserved.Thisresultsfrom thefactthatthereisnodifferenceintherefractiveindex n r be- tweenboth,andonlyadifferenceof < 5%for α bb intheweakly absorptionrange,themostrelevantrangefordetermining J L .

Next,theparameterizationoftheintrinsicrecombinationrate R intr , K [7]isreplacedbytherecentparameterization R intr , R [10].Ascanbeseenfromrow E,R intr , R resultsinasigniﬁcantly higherefﬁciency(0.27%-abs.)than R intr , K ,whichoriginates fromsigniﬁcantlylowerrecombinationratesfortheradiative recombination[8],[9]aswellastheAugerrecombination[10]. Interestingly,thisresultsnotinahigher V OC ,butinahigher FF ,duetothehighermppvoltage V mpp ,andahigher J SC .The reducedrecombinationrateleadstoanincreaseoftheoptimal cellthicknessby ∼ 15 µ m,whichisthereasonforthehigher J SC . Finally,theresultsofrow F werecalculatedtakingBGN forthedeterminationof n i , eﬀ intoaccount,insteadofassuming n i , eﬀ = n i, 0 tobeconstantat8.28 × 10 9 cm − 3 .Thisresults inaefﬁciencyreductionof0.14%-abs.,whichismainlydueto a6mVlower V OC levelandconsequentlyalsoalower V mpp level,whilethe FF evenincreasedslightly.Thedifferencein V mpp of3.6mVisingoodagreementwiththe3.4mVoriginally estimatedbyTiedje etal.

An ultra-thin intrinsic a-Si:H buffer layer was introduced on the c-Si wafer surface using a 13.56 MHz home-made RF-PECVD with low deposition rate showing superior surface passivation. The ultra-thin i-a-Si:H film with both higher microstructure factor (R*) and H content evidently increases the SHJ solar cell open-circuit voltage (V OC ) by 2 mV, and moreover, short-circuit current (I SC ) and fill factor (FF) are also notably improved, resulting in a 0.52% absolute cell efficiency enhancement, in which FF is the main cause. In order to explore high conversion efficiency SHJ solar cells, both home-made RF-PECVD and commercial VHF-PECVD (40.68 MHz) are employed for deposition of the i-a-Si:H passivation layer. As a result, the efficiency of RF-PECVD-prepared SHJ cell is 0.21% higher than that of VHF- PECVD-prepared, mainly driven by V OC  and I SC  boost. This work offers a useful tool for fabrication of high performance SHJ solar cells which could be employed in mass production.    1.Introduction In recent years, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technology has demonstrated great potential in both exploring high conversion effi - ciency and upscaling towards mass production, owing to its bifacial capability, low operating temperature coefficient, and relatively straightforward manufacturing process [1–3]. Multiple SHJ efficiency milestones have been reported worldwide [4–10], accomplished through various materials, methods, and/or tools. For instance, Pana - sonic announced a total area (t.a., 101.8 cm 2 ) conversion efficiency of 24.7%, using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), reactive plasma deposition (RPD), and screen-printed silver electrodes [4]. In contrast, Kaneka later set the record (t.a., 239.0 cm 2 ) efficiency of 24.5% and aperture area (151.9 cm 2 ) efficiency of 25.1% with plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), physical vapor deposi - tion (PVD), and electroplated copper grid fingers [5]. Previously, we also reported a 24.85% (t.a., 244.5 cm 2 ) efficiency based on PECVD, PVD, and screen-print process [11]. In addition to these leading effi - ciencies for the front-rear contacted SHJ solar cells, the formation of interdigitated back contact (IBC) structure enables extra efficiency benefits and makes SHJ þIBC (HBC) the most efficient device among the crystalline-silicon-based photovoltaics technologies [12–16]. A high V OC  for a SHJ solar cell is required to achieve a high effi - ciency, which relies on excellent passivation of the c-Si surface that is mainly dominated by hydrogenation of silicon dangling bonds and reduction of interfacial defect density with intrinsic amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) layers [17,18]. The properties of the i-a-Si:H layers, e.g., deposited by PECVD, could be largely influenced by a number of factors, typically including deposition power, pressure, temperature [19,20], hydrogen dilution [21,22], in-situ hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) [23–25], thermal annealing [26–28], bi-layers [29,45,46], etc. Furthermore, intrinsic silicon-based alloy alternatives like amorphous silicon-oxide (a-SiO x :H) [30] and amorphous silicon-carbide (a-SiC x :H) [31] are also applicable for improving c-Si surface passivation. In most cases, a combination of several turning knobs may be needed. Liu et al. reported that a less dense i-a-Si:H layer was beneficial to V OC  if it is capped with a dense a-Si:H layer [32]. Zhang et al. showed that i-a-Si:H bi-layer with a porous interfacial layer improved the minority carrier  *Corresponding author. **Corresponding author.

Similarly, Sai’s group also demonstrated that i-a-Si:H bilayer with a porous interfacial layer with high hydrogen content could substantially improve the implied V OC  and pseudo fill factor (pFF) of SHJ solar cells [29]. Very-high-frequency (VHF-) excited PECVD is commonly used [21, 34], as in the above scenarios, to grow i-a-Si:H at a relatively high deposition rate (�8 Å/s) with elevated power density, to avoid epitaxial growth near the a-Si:H/c-Si interface. However, VHF-PECVD prepared a-Si:H films often exhibit high bulk defect density and non-uniformity [36], which may lead to efficiency losses. On the other hand, PECVD powered by radio-frequency (RF-) excitation is expected to improve the film quality due to a lower deposition rate (~2 Å/s). However, the risk of plasma induced defects and epitaxial growth at the interface becomes more prominent [21,28,37]. Therefore, the trade-off between interfacial passivation and bulk quality of i-a-Si:H layer makes it challenging for RF-PECVD-based process development. In this work, we introduce a low deposition rate, approximately 2 Å/ s, i-a-Si:H (i 1 ) buffer layer grown prior to the bulk i-a-Si:H layer, both deposited with RF-PECVD, as shown in Fig. 1a, to improve c-Si surface passivation and thus the efficiency of SHJ solar cell. The optical and structural properties of i 1  buffer layer are studied by spectral trans - mittance and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The sur - face passivation quality of the i 1 þi-a-Si:H stack is evaluated with passivated samples. SHJ solar cells with i-a-Si:H layers deposited by RF- and VHF-PECVD are fabricated and compared. As a result, the insertion of i 1  buffer layer substantially improved the cell performance and we report a new total area efficiency of 25.11% on an M2 c-Si wafer. 2.Experimental details In this study, deposition of the i 1  and i-a-Si:H films was conducted in a home-made parallel plate RF-PECVD (13.56 MHz) reactor. Optical transmittance of a-Si:H deposited on glass substrate was characterized by a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer. FTIR responses were captured by a Nicolet IS-10 spectrometer with a-Si:H films (~15 nm) deposited on a 500   m thick polished (100) oriented c-Si (1000  cm) substrates. Thicknesses of a-Si:H films were confirmed by a Syscos spectroscopic ellipsometer. Passivated samples were made in a sym - metrical structure: covered by identical intrinsic and doped layers, either with or without i 1  buffer (see Fig. 1a and b), on both surfaces of the double side textured and cleaned c-Si wafer. The effective minority carrier lifetime ( � eff ) was measured by a Sinton WCT-120 flash tester in transient mode. Two Ideal Energy VHF-PECVD (40.68 MHz) systems were used to deposit the reference i-a-Si:H, p-type a-Si:H, and n-type   c- SiO x :H layers during the cell fabrication. The main PECVD deposition parameters are listed in Table 1. All SHJ solar cells were bifacial, fabricated on LONGi n-type M2 CZ c- Si wafers, with resistivity of 1–5  cm, thickness of 150   m, in (100) orientation. Intrinsic a-Si:H layers, as described in Table 1, were deposited with RF- or VHF-PECVD, capped by the same doped layers (see Fig. 1a and c). TCO layers were formed by a home-made PVD tool using 90:10 indium-tin-oxide (ITO) material sputtered from a rotary target. Silver grid electrodes were screen printed followed by a 190  � C curing for 30 min. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of SHJ solar cells were taken by a Vision VS-6821S I-V tester under standard test  Fig. 1.Schematic illustration of the SHJ solar cell structure: (a) RF-PECVD-prepared intrinsic layer with i 1  buffer layer, (b) RF-PECVD-prepared normal intrinsic layer, (c) VHF-PECVD-prepared intrinsic layer.

All cells were illuminated from the n-side and the conversion efficiency was calculated on the total area of 244.5 cm 2 . External quantum efficiency (EQE) and reflectance spectra of SHJ solar cells were measured on the entire front surface including the grid-shaded area with Bentham PVE300-IVT system over the wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 1170 nm. 3.Results and discussion The FTIR spectra of RF-PECVD deposited 15-nm-thick i 1  buffer and normal i-a-Si:H layers on polished c-Si substrates are shown in Fig. 2, fitted with two Gaussian-distributed absorption peaks centered at wavenumbers of 2000 cm �1  and 2100 cm �1 , representing monohydride (Si-H) bond and dihydrides (Si-H 2 ) bond stretching modes, respectively [38–40]. The relative intensities of Si-H and Si-H 2  absorption for i 1  buffer (see Fig. 2a) and normal i-a-Si:H (see Fig. 2b) layers are signifi - cantly different. We observed a greater contribution of Si-H 2  mode in the overall absorption for i 1  buffer layer, implying a higher void density and more disordered hydrogen incorporation within the film [41]. The microstructure factor R*, defined as R* �I Si-H2 /(I Si-H2 �I Si-H ), where I Si-H2  and I Si-H  are peak intensities, is 0.65 for i 1  buffer layer and 0.16 for normal i-a-Si:H layer. Hydrogen content calculation (CH) is carried out as introduced by Langford reported [47], which is related to the stretching-mode absorption via CH �A 2000 I 2000 �A 2090 I 2090  �A 2000 R(  /  )d  �A 2090 R(  /  )d  , where,    is the absorption coefficient,    is the frequency in cm -1 , A is the proportionality constant, which are A 2000  �9.0 �10 19  cm -2 , and A 2090  �2.2 �10 22  cm -2 , respectively. The sum of Si-H and Si-H 2  peak integrals gives a 25.8% hydrogen content for i 1  buffer layer and 15.8% for normal a-Si:H layer [41]. In general, high quality i-a-Si:H material with lower void density (lower R*) is beneficial to the performance of SHJ solar cells [48,49]. However, during RF-PECVD deposition, the epitaxial growth at the a-Si: H/c-Si interface may have a detrimental impact on the surface passiv - ation [35]. In spite of the defective nature, the hydrogen-rich i 1  buffer layer is still expected to improve the passivation by forming an abrupt a-Si:H/c-Si interface [42], as long as the thickness of such layer is controlled in a range of 0.5-1.0 nm. We found that a 0.5–1.0 nm ultra-thin i 1  buffer layer underneath the bulk i-a-Si:H layer could play a pivotal role in the surface passivation. Fig. 3 gives the  � eff  of the passivated samples fabricated with and without ultra-thin i 1  buffer layer, where  � eff  is obtained at a carrier injection level of 5 �10 15  cm -3 . The total i-a-Si:H film thicknesses remained the same. After inserting the i 1  buffer layer,  � eff  exhibited a substantial increase from 2.3 ms to 4.5 ms, which implied that the hydrogen-rich yet defective i 1  buffer layer can effectively improve surface passivation. It is confirmed that the iV OC  of the two passivated samples in Fig. 1 (see Fig. 1a and b) were 749.8 mV and 745.7 mV, respectively, where a 4.1 mV gap means that the i1�i-a-Si:H film stack process has room for further optimization. It could be attributed to effectively saturated silicon dangling bonds and probably minimized interfacial epitaxial growth under low deposition rate con - ditions during the RF-PECVD process. Furthermore, it may be ascribed to increased band offsets, thus increased barrier for charge transport [50]. Further research for good surface passivation with hydrogen-rich a-Si:H is ongoing in our project. The effect of ultra-thin i 1  a-Si:H buffer layer on SHJ solar cell per - formances were verified by two groups of cells, four cells per group, fabricated with and without i 1  buffer layer on both n and p sides (see Fig. 1a and b). Except for the abovementioned different interfacial ultra- thin i-a-Si:H layer (less than 1 nm) configuration, process conditions for the remaining layers remain the same, where a 6 nm n-type a-Si:H layer, a 8 nm p-type a-Si:H layer, a 70 nm multi-layer-stack ITO layer both for front and rear side, and a five-busbar Ag screen-printed front grid were applied for two groups’ cell fabrication. As a proof of concept experi - ment on pilot line, all non-intrinsic a-Si:H components were designed suitably for mass production without further tuning. Both groups of SHJ cells adopted the multi-i-layer structure designed for cell efficiency enhancement. The i 1  buffer layers were prepared at a low deposition rate of 2.3 Å/s. Bulk i-a-Si:H layers were deposited by RF-PECVD in both cases. As shown in Fig. 4 (Batch A), the i 1  buffer layer gives rise to a 2- mV benefit in V OC , which is consistent with the improved surface passivation suggested by the  � eff  measurements. In addition, increased  Fig. 2.FTIR spectra for i 1  buffer and normal i-a-Si:H layers deposited by RF-PECVD, fitted with two Gaussian-distributed absorption peaks centered at wavenumbers of 2000 cm �1  and 2100 cm �1 , representing monohydride (Si-H) bond and dihydrides (Si-H 2 ) bond stretching modes, respectively.

The dashed line is plotted according to simplified Richter parameteriza - tion [43].  X. Ru et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I SC  and FF are also obtained, which may be related to the enhanced optical transmittance and carrier transportation, respectively. As a result, it ends up with an improvement of 0.52% in conversion efficiency. Prior to the current work, our SHJ solar cells of champion efficiency were all processed by VHF-PECVD [44]. Fig. 5 shows the cross-sectional TEM images taken at the a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces of the best-performing cells with RF-PECVD (Fig. 5a) and VHF-PECVD (Fig. 5b) deposited i-a-Si:H layers. In both cases, we observed atomically sharp interfaces without traces of epitaxy. During VHF-PECVD reactions, higher depo - sition rate could prevent epitaxial growth due to abundant silyl radicals which can facilitate transition from crystalline to amorphous phase [19, 35]. In our study, deposition rate of VHF-PECVD was 7.8 Å/s, which is closed to that reported by S. Kim et al., 8.3 Å/s [19]. By employing a 3-fold lower deposition rate (2.3 Å/s) i 1  buffer layer, RF-PECVD is also capable of forming good surface passivation and V OC  is not affected. Fig. 6 shows EQE and reflectance (refl.) spectra of SHJ solar cells with RF- and VHF-PECVD deposited i-a-Si:H layers (see Fig. 1a and c). When RF-PECVD i-a-Si:H layer used, EQE enhancement in the region of 300-650 nm but no reflectance difference is observed in the whole re - gion, suggesting that a change in reflection is not the source of the gain. Also indicated by the inset of Fig. 6 is better optical transmittance of RF- PECVD i-a-Si:H film deposited on glass substrate, which could be responsible for the I SC  gain in the above region. It turns out that the optical bandgap of RF-PECVD i-a-Si:H layers is higher, probably due to the elevated hydrogen content within the i 1  buffer layer. Thus, it is a promising candidate to further reduce the parasitic absorption and to enhance the carrier collection in the SHJ solar cell. The I-V characteristics of the SHJ solar cells with RF- and VHF- PECVD processed i-a-Si:H layers are compared in Fig. 4 (Batch B), four cells per group. To evaluate the two PECVD processes, as well as to further explore the efficiency potential of SHJ solar cells, RF- and VHF- PECVD based i-a-Si:H layers were further integrated with other opti - mization methods, including fine tuning of the stack layer structure, layer thickness distribution and total film thickness, to reach their best cell performing (see Fig. 1a and c). Compared to Batch A, two major  Fig. 4.The illuminated I-V parameters of two batches SHJ solar cells on M2 wafers, Batch A: two groups cells from RF-PECVD, A1: with ultra-thin i1 buffer layer, A2: without ultra-thin i1 buffer layer and Batch B: two groups cells with RF-PECVD i-a-Si:H layers (B1) and VHF-PECVD i-a-Si:H layers (B2).

Ru et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        components of a 20 nm n-type   c-SiOx:H layer and a 12 busbar Ag screen-printed front grid, combined with an addition antireflection coating on top of the cell, were specifically designed to pursue higher cell efficiency, while all other components process remained the same. From Fig. 4 (Batch B), RF-PECVD cell exhibits even higher V OC , compared with VHF-PECVD. The I SC  difference is in good agreement with the shift in EQE spectra as shown in Fig. 6. In-house measurements show that the efficiency of RF-PECVD cell is higher by 0.21%, mainly driven by Isc and Voc boost. The same optimization strategies (RF-PECVD based) were employed and verified in SHJ pilot line. Combined with other fine tuning steps, including wafer cleaning, environment control, and operation stan - dardization, eventually a total area efficiency of 25.11% for SHJ solar cell was achieved and certified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH), with V OC  ¼747.0 mV, I SC  ¼9.669 A, and FF ¼84.98%, on a total area of 244.5 cm 2  (see Fig. 7). Noticeably, for the contacting of our multi-busbar cells, very thin contact bars were used, which has a thin and elastic contact plate inside. Wherein, each bar has 30 contact points, equally distributed over the busbar. 4.Conclusions In summary, a 0.5–1 nm i 1  a-Si:H buffer layer deposited by RF- PECVD with high hydrogen content and large microstructure factor (R*) was introduced, which improved the c-Si surface passivation effectively. The results showed that no epitaxial growth was observed at the a-Si:H/c-Si interface when an i-a-Si:H buffer layer was grown with low deposition rate using RF-PECVD. It was also shown that one could get generally equivalent surface passivation with either RF- or VHF- PECVD tools. Incorporation of the RF-PECVD processed i 1 þi-a-Si:H film stack resulted in a 0.21% efficiency advantage compared with VHF- PECVD based cells, mainly driven by Isc and Voc improvement. The efficiency of 25.11% certified by ISFH was obtained on a total area of 244.5 cm 2 . The results suggest that RF-PECVD deposited low-deposition-rate i-a- Si:H is a good material for buffer layers to boost cell performance. Further investigation is also needed to better understand the FF improvement in the presence of i 1 -a-Si:H layers prepared by RF-PECVD.

Others have not occurred as quickly as expected (adopting Si heterojunction cells and shifting to n-type wafers). ,"BSF, PERC, TOPCon, SHJ, IBC*","Varies as it applies to multiple types of cells and the discussions about them. The cells vary int extered vs planar surfaces in terms of the rear electron contact, but all of the front hole contacts are textured. The efficiency, current, current density, voltage, and fill factor are not listed in chart form, but listed in text form as the passage talks about it. This article is less of a scientific report and more of a discussion on the history of the cells. I don't plan on using this unless there is a need in my report for some history on the synthesis of TOPCon cells.

INTRODUCTION Passivating and carrier-selective contacts which consist of an ultrathin SiOx layer and a heavily doped silicon film like TOPCon or poly-Si [1-5] are an appealing technology to  further push the efficiency of silicon solar cells. The  replacement of a partial rear contact (PRC) scheme by  TOPCon as a full-area rear contact has so far resulted in  efficiencies up to 25.8 % [6], but so far the full potential of  this technology was only demonstrated on small area (4 cm2). While first steps towards solar cells of practical size (≥ 100 cm2) featuring a TOPCon rear and a diffused front side were presented recently [7], the actual goal is the transfer of all processes to industrial-size (156×156 mm2) and solar-grade material. One of the missing links in the processing chain is the deposition of the doped TOPCon Si layer using industrial technology, the other one is a module-compatible rear side  metallization. Here, we focus on these components. As an  alternative deposition technology for the doped Si layer, we  investigate tube furnace direct plasma-enhanced chemical  vapor deposition (PECVD). Due to the operating frequency in  the kHz range, it has to be investigated if ion bombardment  causes damage to the ultrathin tunnel oxide layer [8,9].  Regarding the rear side metallization, one option is to use a  low-temperature approach similar to a-Si hetero-junction solar cells using transparent conductive oxide (TCO), but in contrast to a-Si with higher flexibility in the process temperatures. At the device level, the focus is on n-type silicon solar cells with the TOPCon rear side and a boron-diffused front side as shown in Fig. 1, with the front side being contacted by laser contact opening (LCO) and a plated stack of  nickel, copper and silver (NiCuAg).  Fig. 1. Layout sketch of the investigated  solar cell structure. Note that for the cells presented in Table I, the TCO was omitted as the  process was not available at the time. II. INDUSTRIAL-SCALE TOPCON DEPOSITION TECHNOLOGY So far, for the deposition of doped amorphous silicon or silicon-rich silicon carbide (SiCx) thin films as used in the TOPCon scheme small laboratory reactors, usually operating  in the MHz range were used. Recently, it was demonstrated  that it is possible to use industrial scale tube furnace PECVD reactors operating in the kHz range [10]. Initially, there were  concerns due to the low operating frequency in the kHz range,  resulting in possible surface damage by ion bombardment  [8,9]. However, it was shown that these concerns are not  justified and excellent surface passivation can be achieved using this approach.    A.Experimental Details  To evaluate the surface passivation quality, we used 1 Ωcm n-type FZ c-Si wafers of 100 mm wafer diameter with 200 μm thickness. The wafers received an RCA cleaning, after  which they received a thermal oxidation at 1050 °C to reduce  the number of bulk defects [11]. The oxide was then removed  in buffered HF and the tunnel oxide layer was grown in nitric  acid (HNO3) or—for samples marked as “TO”— thermally in a tube furnace at 600 °C for 10 min in O2/N2 ambient. On top of the tunnel oxide a-SiCx(n) layers were deposited  978-1-5386-8529-7/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE1507 Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Central Florida.

After the deposition, the samples were annealed in a tube furnace in inert ambient at 850 °C and 900 °C in case of HNO3 and TO, respectively. Finally, the samples received a thermal treatment in atomic  hydrogen atmosphere [12] at 400 °C. To determine the contact  resistivity, a stack of titanium, palladium and silver was  thermally evaporated on the samples using a linear TLM  pattern measured by four-terminal sensing. To evaluate the  passivation on solar-grade material, we used 156×156 mm2 pseudo-square 2 cm Cz n-type c-Si wafers of approx. 180 μm thickness. The Cz wafers were processed similarly to the  FZ wafers with two changes. (i) Prior to the initial cleaning,  the wafers received a saw damage etch in KOH. (ii) At the  end, the atomic hydrogen treatment was omitted as the technology was not yet available at this wafer size.

Injection-dependent effective minority carrier lifetime for the cPLASMA TOPCon layers with HNO3 and thermal (TO) tunnel oxide. The solid line gives the intrinsic bulk lifetime (according to  Richter et al. [13]) for the used substrate.  Fig. 2 shows the measured injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime  for the planar FZ Si samples. Already using the HNO3 tunnel oxide, we achieved an excellent lifetime of around 9-10 ms at n < 5×1014 cm-3, which is at the same level as the intrinsic bulk lifetime according to Richter et al. [13]. Using the thermal oxide, the measured lifetimes were even  higher, with up to 12-13 ms. This is an extraordinary result for such a new process, especially considering the original concerns regarding the ion bombardment the tunnel oxide has  to withstand, concerns which were thus successfully disproved. The excellent minority carrier lifetimes resulted in an implied VOC of approx. 735 mV for both oxides. The good injection-dependency resulted in an implied FF above 87 %. To prove that the new layers not only result in excellent surface passivation quality, but can also be contacted, we  determined the contact resistivity using TLM structures. Here, all measured values were in the range of 3-6 mΩ cm2 with only very low variation, meaning that all of the layers exhibit good contact ability and no impact on the series resistance is expected by either combination.On Cz material, we observed (by photoluminescence imaging) a homogeneous surface passivation. The remaining  inhomogeneities were attributed to wafer handling. Over the whole carrier, we determined an implied VOC of 719 ± 2 mV averaged over 22 wafers. The gap to the samples discussed above can mainly be explained by the absence of the hydrogen passivation, which so far on this wafer size remains to be done. However, even at 719 mV implied VOC, it is highly unlikely that the rear side will induce a limitation in the VOC of the final cell structure. III. TRANSPARENT CONDUCTIVE OXIDE ON TOPCON For module integration it is important to have a rear side metallization compatible with module technology. One  possibility here is to use a TCO. A.Experimental Details  To investigate the properties of the TOPCon/ITO system,we used TOPCon lifetime samples with layers from the  cPLASMA tool fabricated as described in the previous  section. Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) was then deposited  symmetrically on both sides using DC-magnetron sputtering.  The contact resistivity was determined by measuring the  resistance between the surfaces. The doping level of the TOPCon poly-Si was varied since this might influence the contact ability of the ITO to this layer. B.Results and Discussion  Fig. 3. gives the implied VOC determined before and after depositing ITO in dependence of the doping level of the  TOPCon poly-Si. Only for the lowest investigated poly-Si doping a degradation was observed in the range of 10 mV. For  the higher doping levels, the implied VOC remained approx. the same. However,even though degradation due to sputter  damage was observed for the best samples, the implied VOCafter TCO deposition at 720 mV was still high enough to not induce a significant limit for the solar cells, for which the estimated VOC would be in the range of 700-710 mV (on 156×156 mm2 Cz). As an alternative, the sputter damage could also be cured by thermal treatment [14]. In the experiment, we also observed a trend towards lower PH3,which is caused by too much in-diffusion of dopants from the poly-Si into the c-Si resulting in a significant increase in the recombination. The results from the resistance measurements showed that theITOto poly-Si contact had specific contact resistivities of approx.  5 mΩcm2 for all poly-Si doping levels. Hence an increase in the doping level is not necessary for a low series resistance. 978-1-5386-8529-7/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE1508 Authorized licensed use limited to: University of Central Florida.

LARGE-AREA TOPCON SOLAR CELLS Solar cells of significant area (100×100 mm2) were fabricated similarly as described in [7]. The cells featured a homogeneous 140 Ω/sq boron emitter and n-TOPCon as passivating rear contact. The results of the I-V measurements are given in Table I. For lithographically structured contacts, a high VOC of 713 mV was achieved, underlining the excellent performance of the  front and rear passivation. A high JSC of 41.4 mA/cm2 and an excellent FF of 83.1 % prove that a very good balance between shading and resistance losses was found. Overall, this proves that the cell structure is capable of 24.5 % cell  efficiency. With laser contact opening, we observed a lower  VOC of 697 mV, which can be attributed to the laser-induced damage [7] as well as a higher contact fraction (increase from 0.5 % to 1.5 %), since in this case contacting bus bars were  applied. While the JSC at 41.4 % was similar, the FF was slightly lower at 81.2 %, but still at a high level. The difference to the lithography cell can be partially attributed to an increased front recombination leading to a loss in FF0/pFFof 0.5 %abs. The remaining ~1 %abs loss in the FF can be attributed to a higher grid resistance compared to the evaporated fingers. Overall, a good cell efficiency of 23.4 % was achieved underlining the potential of the laser contact  opening and NiCuAg plating.  In regard to the future development of the solar cell concept, it was shown in [7] that the main limitation in the cell performance currently are the optical losses and recombination losses due to the front contacts and grid, mainly due to the  metal/silicon contact area and shading area of the front bus bars. If the metal/silicon contact area underneath the bus bars  are omitted (e.g. by using a bus bar-less cell and the smart wire  cell interconnection) , the contact fraction can be reduced to 0.4 % and thus the J0 contribution due to the front contacted area can be reduced and a VOC of  approx. 708 mV can be achieved. Further improvement in the LCO process should  allow for reduced laser damage and thus even lower J0contribution. Combined with the advantages in plating homogeneity and reduced optical losses, it should be a goal to fabricate bus bar-less solar cells focusing on wire- interconnection, since this should allow the cell concept to close the gap to the 24.5 % lithography cell and possibly even exceed its performance without requiring a selective emitter. V. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that kHz direct-plasma PECVD can be used to deposit TOPCon layers. Concerns about ion bombardment degrading the tunnel oxide layer were  disproved. Instead we determined excellent surface passivation quality, in conjunction with a thermally grown tunnel oxide  with up to 13 ms on 1 cm n-type. In addition, we demonstrated that the passivation on large solar-grade material  is very good achieving a mean implied VOC of 719 mV and that the layers can be contacted using ITO. At the device level, we fabricated cells on 100×100 mm2 achieving efficiencies of 24.5 % with lithographic contact opening on the front and  23.4 % with laser contact opening.  REFERENCES [1] F.

Introduction In the last year, different n-type Si solar cells with carrier-selective contacts featuring tunnel oxides have been presented [1-3]. All concepts feature high open circuit voltages of up to 739 mV [2] due to the good passivation  prope rties of the oxide layers and high conversion efficiencies of up to 24.4 % [4] have been reached. Experimentally different approaches for the passivated contact are presented. Especially the doped Si layer can be amorphous [2], polycrystalline [3] or partially crystalline [4].

In this work, since tunneling is expected to be efficient for very thin oxides (< 20 Å) [6] and some of the cell concepts feature ultra-thin oxide layers (12-15 Å [2] and 14 Å [1]), we assume that current transport is a result of carrier tunneling through the ultra-thin oxide layer. The investigation of the contact quality of tunnel oxide passivated electron contacts is carried out performing numerical device simulations using Sentaurus Device [7]. In this work we will focus on the simulation principles (including details on the optical simulation) and the basic results concerning the recombination properties by means  of an analysis of the open circuit voltage.  2.   Simulation setup The here investigated device is based on the electron selective TOPCon approach of Ref. [4]. The optical simulation as well as the electrical simulation are performed with Sentaurus Device [7]. Using such a complex  device simulation environment is essential for the detailed investigation of the rear side properties of the solar cell as presented in this work, featuring thin layer stacks, complex band structures and carrier tunneling. 2.1.   Optical simulation The optical simulation is performed using a 3D symmetry element representing a quarter (upright) pyramid of the  front  surface texture of the modeled solar cell. Front metal contacts are not actually modeled in the optical simulation. The optical shading is considered in the electrical simulation by scaling the optical generation in the device. Sentaurus Device uses a combination of transfer matrix model for thin layers like the anti-reflection coatings (ARC) at the front and raytracing. The cell features a double ARC at the front on top of a thin Al 2O3  passivation layer. The corresponding layer thicknesses are listed in Table 1. The complex refractive indices of the MgF 2  at the front and the Si layer at the rear are based on experimental data measured at the Fraunhofer ISE, the materials of the  remaining thin layers are taken from the material database of Sentaurus Device. Table 1. Materials and corresponding thicknesses of the thin layer stacks (front and rear) used in the optical simulation.

The optical and the electrical simulation are coupled using a 1D photo generation profile. This 1D profile is created from the 3D optical simulation by integrating over layers of equal distance perpendicular to the surface of  the front texture. This is done for each wavelength and then the depth dependent total optical generation (shown in  Fig. 1) is calculated depending on the irradiation spectrum, in this case the standard AM1.5G solar spectrum. The front texture is not actually modeled in the electrical simulation and the 1D generation profile is applied to an approximated, planar device.

The depth of 0  �P m corresponds to the front surface of the c-Si absorber. Since the focus of this work is set on the electrical modeling of the device, the same generation profile is used for all electrical simulations. Minor deviations due to variation of the oxide thickness, the Si layer material and potential free carrier absorption in an additional diffusion at the rear do not significantly influence the results of the optical  simulation and can therefore be neglected. 2.2.   Electrical simulation The full-area passivated rear contact of the device allows for a simple 2D symmetry element, which is depicted in Fig. 2. On the front it features a selective boron emitter design enabling high open circuit voltages of around 720 mV. Fig. 2. 2D symmetry element for the electrical simulation carried out with Sentaurus Device. On the rear the electron selective contact is created by an ultrathin tunnel oxide (1.5 nm) and an n-doped Si layer. The material parameters of the doped Si layer are one of the main objects of our investigation due to the different existing experimental approaches discussed in the introduction. A schematic band structure of the electron selective rear of the rear of the device is depicted in Fig. 3. The material parameters of the doped Si layer are varied by means of the electron affinity  �F0  and the band gap energy  Eg . In this work we will discuss the two special cases for (i) amorphous silicon ( �F0  = 3.9 eV / Eg = 1.7 eV [10], red) and (ii) poly-crystalline silicon, represented by c-Si band parameters (blue). A more detailed variation of the band parameters and the doping of the Si layer will be published elsewhere.  198   Heiko Steinkemper et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  195 – 201   Fig. 3. Scheme of the band structure of the carrier selective contact featuring a thin tunnel oxide. Additionally the different parameters investigated in this study are depicted. Further investigated parameters such as an additional in-diffusion in the c-Si bulk material (modeled by a Gaussian shaped n++-profile) and the surface recombination velocity at the c-Si/oxide interface  S interface are also indicated in Fig. 3. The simulations are also performed without an oxide interlayer.  S interface is then the recombination velocity at the interface of the c-Si bulk material and the doped Si layer. The recombination velocity at the metal  contact is set to thermal velocity. The physical models used in this study are mainly based on the models proposed in the review on numerical simulation by Altermatt [11]. For Auger recombination the advanced model of Richter et al. [12] is implemented. This is done using a physical model interface (PMI). PMIs offer the possibility to provide new models via C++  functions, and Sentaurus Device loads the functions at run-time [7]. Carrier tunneling through the high band gap tunnel oxide is based on the model presented in Ref. [13]. The resulting tunneling current depends on several parameters depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Factors influencing the tunneling current through a potential barrier. Basically, a carrier-selective contact is established when the minority carriers (here: the holes) are prevented from reaching the rear metal contact and therefore recombination of minority carriers at the metal surface is avoided. A  possibility of achieving such a carrier selective contact is to choose the mentioned device parameters in such a manner that the tunnelling transport of holes through the tunnel oxide is prevented.   Heiko Steinkemper et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  195 – 201 199 3.   Results In this chapter we investigate the recombination characteristics by means of the open circuit voltage  V OC. Fig. 5 shows the  V OC dependent on the surface recombination velocity  S interface for different Si layer band parameters simulated with (left) and without tunnel oxide (right). Fig. 5. Open circuit voltage  V OC plotted against the interface recombination velocity  S interface for different band parameters for the doped Si layer. The results for a-Si (red) and poly-Si represented by the band parameters of c-Si (red) are plotted for simulation performed with tunnel oxide (left) and without tunnel oxide (right). Fig. 5 shows that for the investigated parameters there are two possibilities of introducing a carrier selective contact, i.e. to avoid recombination at the Si layer / metal interface:  �x  By introducing a tunnel oxide below the Si layer (left)  �x  By using a high band gap material for the Si layer (right, red) For these three structures the  V OC is on a very high level for surface recombination velocities below  S interface = 10 3  cm s-1 representing a good chemical passivation. The  V OC decreases for higher  S interface as recombination at the c-Si / oxide (left) or c-Si / Si layer interface (right) becomes dominant. Fig. 6.  V OC plotted against  S interface for different band parameters for the doped Si layer, similar to Fig. 5 but with an additional in-diffusion in the bulk material (open triangles). Again, the device is simulated with oxide (left) and without oxide (right). Fig. 6 shows the influence of an additional (n++) in-diffusion in the bulk material (dotted lines with open triangles) on the  V OC of the device. The latter may occur due to high temperature processes during cell fabrication. An  200   Heiko Steinkemper et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  195 – 201  additional highly doped n++ region in the bulk material is not beneficial for the  V OC if the device features a good surface passivation (low  S interface values). For high peak concentrations of the diffusion, the  V OC is even reduced due to Auger recombination in the diffusion region. The reason for the low recombination and therefore the high  V OC (with tunnel oxide and for moderate surface recombination velocities of up to  S interface = 10 3  cm s-1) even without diffusion is the induced band bending in the bulk material. This band bending originates from the high doping of the rear Si layer. The band structures, corresponding to the high band gap material and with tunnel oxide (compare Fig. 6, left), are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. The band structure of a carrier-selective contact featuring a tunnel oxide (yellow) and a highly doped high band gap material at the rear is plotted without (solid lines) and with an additional in-diffusion (dotted lines) in the bulk material (corresponding to Fig. 6, left).   The detailed view of the valence band in Fig. 7 (right, solid line) shows very well the shallow induced band bending. For cells where recombination at the interface is dominant or cells featuring a low band gap material and no  tunnel oxide the additional diffusion, which is much deeper than the induced band bending, improves the cell performance due to a lower minority carrier concentration close to the the c-Si / oxide or c-Si / Si layer interface, respectively. However, an in-diffusion in the bulk material also affects the majority carrier (electron) transport through the tunnel oxide. A higher electron concentration close to the oxide interface, originating from an additional in- diffusion, enhances the electron tunneling current through the tunnel oxide (compare Fig. 4). Therefore a moderate diffusion, without significant reduction of the  V OC due to Auger recombination, may improve the overall cell performance. 4.   Conclusion and outlook We discussed different experimental approaches for carrier-selective contacts featuring thin oxide interlayers based on different materials (poly-crystalline and amorphous) by means of numerical device simulation. A passivating and carrier-selective contact can be established in two different ways: (i) the use of a thin tunnel oxide or (ii) the application of a high band gap material. An additional in-diffusion in the bulk material, which may occur due to high temperature processes during cell fabrication is not beneficial for the recombination properties of a device featuring a good surface passivation. It reduces the  V OC due to Auger recombination in the diffusion region. For the majority carrier transport and therefore the fill factor of the device such an in-diffusion can improve the device performance depending also on the applied doping of the Si layer, the tunnel oxide thickness and the assumed tunnelling mass. Further analysis on this topic including additional parameters, more detailed parameter variations and the discussion of the majority carrier transport properties by means of a fill factor analysis will be presented in a future publication.

In this work, we have investigated the impact of different rear surface morphologies on the electrical performance of bifacial PERCs with both five-busbar (5BB) and nine-busbar (9BB) grid design. The passivation and optical properties with differing rear surfaces are evaluated on semi-device structures. The depth of local aluminum back surface field is hardly affected by the rear surface morphology. The calculated efficiency loss analysis indicates that the negative electrical impact with enlarged rear surface area is more serious for rear side than that of front side. The batch conversion efficiency of 9BB bifacial PERCs increases by 0.2%–0.3% comparing to 5BB ones depending on the rear surface roughness. Consequently, a highest front-side average efficiency of 22.57%, with a champion efficiency of 22.75%, has been achieved for 9BB bifacial p-Si PERCs with a nearly planar rear surface. A highest bifaciality of 78.7% is realized for both 5BB and 9BB bifacial PERCs with the roughest rear surface. We have further simulated the relative enhancement of electric generation to compare the performance of bifacial PERCs in practical application.    1.Introduction Recently, the crystalline silicon (c-Si) passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs) have dominated the highly competitive photovoltaic market due to low industrial cost, simple manufacturing process and high power conversion efficiency (  ) [1–3]. The average efficiency for mass produced Czochralski (Cz) p-type Si based PERCs has stepped into the stage of 22.5% and LONGi solar declared the world-record efficiency of PERCs to be 24.06% in 2019 [4]. The annual production capacity of p-Si PERCs has already reached over 100 GWp in 2019 in China. Another advantage of the p-Si PERCs is the easy processing sequence and the fabrication of bifacial solar cells are fully compatible with existing PERC production lines only by replacing full area aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) with Al finger grids on the rear side [5,6]. The amount of consumed Al paste has been proved to be dramatically reduced by 90% and deeper p þ -doped Al-BSF can be yielded for higher open-circuit voltage (V oc ) [7]. As we know, bifacial solar cells have received extensive attention [8, 9] because of their potential to absorb sunlight from the front side and rear side simultaneously, which was predicted to increase the annual produced electricity by up to 30% [10,11], thus causing the reduction of the levelized cost of electricity. Such a concept was first proposed by Mori in 1960s [12], but bifacial solar cells were transferred into mass production in recent years driven by mature passivation technology [13, 14], high conductive metal paste [15,16] and advanced laser ablation technology [17]. According to the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) 2020 [18], the market share of bifacial solar cells in 2019 was about 20% and predicted to increase to 70% in 2030. However, the typical n-type silicon bifacial solar cells, such as n-PERT (passivated emitter, rear totally diffused) [19,20] and HIT (hetero - junction with intrinsic thin layer) [21,22], still encounter the challenge of low market share (only ~5 GWp in 2019) and significant high amount of silver paste due to the bifacial screen-printed silver finger grids, despite the bifaciality factor can be higher than 90%. Dullweber et al. [7], pioneered the bifacial p-Si PERCs (PERC þconcept) with front-side and rear-side efficiency of 20.8% and 16.5%,  *Corresponding author.

By application of selective emitter and double-printed rear Al electrode, Wu et al. [23], reported in the literature the best front-side efficiency of 22.0% in bifacial p-Si PERCs so far, but with a low rear-side efficiency of 15.3%, a corre - sponding bifaciality of 69.5%. The lower bifaciality in bifacial p-PERCs comparing to that of bifacial n-PERT or HIT is mainly attributed to the nearly one fourth lower short-circuit current density (J sc ) value of rear-side [7,23], which is further limited by the inferior light-trapping property of polished rear surface in combination with high metalliza - tion shading fraction of rear Al grids [7]. A planar rear surface was favorable in case of monofacial PERCs [24,25] due to improved internal long-wavelength reflection and superior passivation property, while a planar surface was detrimental for light trapping when light comes from the rear side in bifacial PERCs. The impact of rear surface morphology on the performance of bifacial PERCs has not been investigated in detail. On the other hand, numerous researches have put focus on the optimization of rear Al finger grids, including laser contact opening (LCO) width, finger printing width and pitch of fingers. Kranz et al. [26], demonstrated that narrower rear Al contact width would lead to deeper Al-BSF, thus lowered contact recombination loss and improved V oc  values in bifacial PERCs. Dullweber et al. [27], also showed that nar - rower LCO width had advantage in enhancing long wavelength reflec - tance and reducing the rear contact recombination due to reduced contact area. A contact width of 32 �2   m, a finger opening width of 100   m and a finger pitch of 1 mm were suggested considering the trade-off between the series resistance loss and rear shading area [6,28]. Meanwhile, the above works all adopted five-busbar (5BB) design for metal grid, the busbars also account for large shading fraction and series resistance loss. The market share of 5BB was predicted to decrease in the following ten years and replaced by multiple-busbar (MBB) technology [18,29,30]. The MBB technology was also confirmed to have a larger tolerance of Al finger width in order to keep the Al finger series resis - tance below 0.05  cm 2  [29]. In this study, we have investigated the impact of rear surface morphology on the performance of bifacial p-type PERCs both experi - mentally and theoretically. The electrical and optical characteristics with variable rear surface textures were evaluated systematically. By integrating these rear surfaces into bifacial PERCs, cells with both 5BB and nine-busbar (9BB) configuration for rear Al grids were successfully fabricated with suggested design [6,28]. Finally, a calculation of the relative enhancement of energy generation was conducted to compare the performance of bifacial PERCs with differing rear surface morphol - ogies in practical application. 2.Experimental and simulation 2.1.Fabrication of bifacial PERCs The p-type Cz-grown silicon wafers with a size of 158.75 mm �158.75 mm, a thickness of 180 �20   m and a resistivity of 0.8–2.0  cm were used in this work. Fig. 1(a) shows the industrial process to fabricate the bifacial PERCs. First, the wafers were treated with RCA cleaning and alkaline texturing. After that, the samples underwent a diffusion (DS- 300C, S.C.) back to back with POCl 3  as diffusion source to form a ho - mogeneous n þ emitter with the sheet resistance of nearly 130 /. The highly doped n þþ area with a sheet resistance of 80 / was formed with driving the P atoms originated from phosphorous silicate glass (PSG) layer into Si by a laser-doping process (DR-AL-Y40, DR Laser). Then, the single-sided chemical etching was performed on the textured pyramids with mixed HF/HNO 3  solution by an inline industrial system (InOxSide, RENA). The detailed etching process started with the oxidation of Si to SiO 2  by HNO 3 , followed by the dissolution of SiO 2  as a result of reacting with HF. The mass fraction of used HF and HNO 3  so - lutions is 49% and 45%, respectively. To obtain different rear surface morphologies, the volume ratio of HF to HNO 3  solution was changed to adjust the tilt angle of pyramids. After etching, PSG layer was removed in HF solution, and the thermal oxidation process was carried out on the samples with O 3  to form the SiO 2  layer. The AlO x  layer prepared by the atomic layer deposition (ALD, Ideal Energy) was capped by triple SiN x : Hs to passivate the rear surface of the p-type wafers. Here, the SiN x :Hs with a thickness of 85 nm were deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, PD-405C, S.C.) with the precursor gases: silane and ammonia. Next, the rear passivation layers were patterned with laser (DR-AL-Y40, DR Laser) to obtain a line width of about 32   m,  Fig. 1.(a) The industrial process for bifacial PERCs. Schematic structure of the fabricated bifacial p-Si PERCs with a (b) planar and (c) rough rear surface.   H.B. Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  thus Al paste can diffuse into Si to form the local Al-BSF. Al screen- printing (Softline-DL-SP, Maxwell) was used to form the front and rear electrodes. Instead of the full area Al-BSF used in PERCs, the rear-side of bifacial PERCs applied an Al metal grid with a 5BB or 9BB design. With regard to the rear-side finger design, for both 5BB and 9BB, a printing width of 100   m and a finger pitch of 1 mm were adopted as other re - searchers suggested [6,28], while the busbar width drops from 900   m (5BB) to 400   m (9BB). Finally, the fast sintering (~800  � C at peak temperature) was conducted in an infrared industrial belt-furnace (CFSeries, Despatch) to form the metal contacts and activate H atoms originated from SiN x :H/AlO x  layers. Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the sche - matic illustrations of fabricated bifacial PERCs with planar and rough rear surface, respectively. 2.2.Characterization The three dimensional (3D) morphologies and roughness parameters of the etched samples were characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanonavi E-Sweep). The morphologies were also investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss Ultra Plus) to measure the pyramid facet angle. The resistivity of wafers and sheet resistance (R sh ) were tested by four-point probes (280I Series, Four Di - mensions Inc.). The refractive index and thickness of AlO x  and SiN x  layers were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE400adv-PV) at  ¼632 nm. The reflectance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cells were measured by PV Measurements system (QEX10). The transmittance spectra of the wafers were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, VERTEX 70, Bruker). Finally, the electrical parameters were measured under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G spectrum, 25  � C) by Halm 3600. To investigate the influence of rear surface morphology on the passivation property, the effective minority carrier lifetime (  eff ), implied open circuit voltage (iV oc ) and dark saturation current density (J 0e ) of symmetrical structures were measured by a quasi-steady-state photoconductance method (WCT-120, Sinton Instruments) at an injec - tion density of 1 �10 15  cm �3 . After texturization, both sides of the wafers were polished with a similar single-sided etching process using mixed HF/HNO 3  solution. Then stack of SiN x :H/AlO x  passivation layers were deposited symmetrically on both sides of the wafers with a SiN x :H/ AlO x /Si/AlO x /SiN x :H structure, followed by a high temperature annealing process in an industrial firing furnace. 2.3.Simulation The impact of rear surface morphology on electrical performance of the bifacial PERC unit cell was simulated by PV Lighthouse software Quokka 2 [3,31,32], and free energy loss analysis (FELA) was extracted to understand the recombination loss and resistive loss of cells. Here, the electrical impact of different rear surface morphologies was represented by the varied value of rear passivated dark saturation current density J 0, passivated  when light comes from front side or rear side. The optical generation file applied in Quokka 2 was extracted from ray tracing simulator OPAL 2. It should be noted that the rear surface morphology also has a significant influence on optical characteristic. Meanwhile, it is difficult to accurately describe the morphology due to the rounding at peaks and valleys of etched pyramids (see Fig. 2). Therefore, when carrying out the OPAL 2 simulation, only the pyramid facet angle was changed without considering the rounding effect.

Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  parameters were listed in Table 1. To evaluate the performance of bifacial PERCs with different rear surface structures in practical application, the electric energy generation on, as an example, June 22nd was calculated based on the measured EQE spectra and the photon flux of solar irradiance spectra [33,34]. The solar irradiance spectra were extracted from solar spectrum calculator on online PV lighthouse software. The modules were assumed to locate in Shanghai (121 � , 31 � ), with a tilt angle of 30 � and azimuth angle of 180 � (face due south). 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Morphology After wet chemical etching, the morphologies and roughness pa - rameters of the wafers were analyzed by AFM. Fig. 2(a–d) show the 3D topography of the rear surface prepared in etching solution with different volume ratios of HF/HNO 3 /H 2 O, all the images were scanned in a region with the scale of 15   m �15   m. After etching in HF/HNO 3 / H 2 O solution at a volume ratio of 30/150/140 (Fig. 2(a)), the silicon surface is covered by uniformly distributed random pyramids. The height of pyramids decreases with increasing the concentration of HF and HNO 3  in Fig. 2(b), while the pyramid structure is still obviously visible. Further increasing the concentration of HF and HNO 3 , smoothed pyramid peaks and troughs are observed in Fig. 2(c), this is ascribed to the higher etching rate of pyramid peaks than that of pyramid valleys [35]. The smoothing effect is enhanced with higher proportion of HF solution, thus the nano-pyramids tend to disappear and combine to form the larger pyramids in Fig. 2(d), leading to the decreased vertical roughness and larger horizontal structure expansion as illustrated in Fig. 2(d1). To characterize the height distribution, two dimensional (2D) pro - files corresponding to each AFM image were generated by taking a linear measurement on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2(a1–d1). The height of biggest pyramid in Fig. 2(a1) is about 2   m. The root mean square R q  of profiles was used to represent vertical roughness [36]. The R q  value drops from 342.7 nm to 187.5 nm in Fig. 2(a1–d1). The surface enlargement factor was also applied to characterize the surface rough - ness, defined by A F  ¼A eS /A pS , where A eS  is the effective surface area with all valleys and peaks, A pS  is the macroscopic base area corre - sponding to the rectangle area in the AFM observation. The value of A F  is summarized in Table 2. The cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the prepared rear surface during different etching processes are displayed in Fig. 2(a2–d2), and the measured pyramid facet angle is recorded on each image. Appar - ently, the random pyramids textured rear surface becomes smoother with increasing the concentration of HF and HNO 3  gradually. In addi - tion, the height of pyramids gets flattened and the pyramid facet angle becomes narrower. The approximate pyramid facet angle    of these samples is fitted to 51.1 � , 35.3 � , 25.8 � and 16.8 � from rough to planar. The    values are mainly used to represent different rear surface struc - tures in the OPAL 2 simulations. The local Al-BSF SEM images of fabricated bifacial PERCs with four different rear surfaces are presented in Fig. 2(a3–d3). It is observed that the Al–Si eutectic layer is uniformly established and few voids are formed, indicating the formation of favorable Al–Si contacts [37,38]. The depth of all the Al-BSFs is around 5   m, considering that the height of largest pyramids in Fig. 2(a1–d1) is only about 2   m, thus the rear surface morphology of cells hardly influences the thickness of Al-BSF. 3.2.Impact of rear surface morphology on passivation and optical characteristics The passivation quality is an extremely important factor for high efficiency solar cells. In order to evaluate the effects of rear surface morphology on passivation property, the   eff  and iV oc  of 100 symmetric samples (shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a) with the same morphology and passivation layers on both sides) were measured. It is necessary to explain that the different samples are represented by corresponding A F  values in the following measurements and experimental results. The decreased A F  values indicate that the rear surface structures become smoother. Fig. 3(a) plots the   eff  and iV oc  as a function of A F , both exhibiting a strong correlation of the rear surface morphology. The   eff  increases gradually with decreasing A F  value. The   eff  (166   s) of sam - ples with an A F  value of 1.068 is almost twice that of 1.621 (92   s), which is attributed to decreased surface recombination rate and more uniformly deposited passivation films. A similar trend is observed for the iV oc . The iV oc  represents the maximal V oc  that a completed cell can potentially achieve. Decreasing A F  value from 1.621 to 1.068, the mean iV oc  increases from 679.2 mV to 683.8 mV, a gain of up to 4.6 mV could be yielded. The above analysis demonstrates the positive influence of flattend surface on passivation owing to changed crystal orientation, decreased surface area, rounded peaks and troughs, more uniform passivation films. An A F  value below 1.1 is recommended to achieve a good passivation quality of rear surface. Light trapping has a fundamental impact on the capacity of gener - ating current and greatly depends on the front and rear surface struc - tures of solar cells. Generally, the front surface applies random upright pyramids to absorb light, thus the structures of rear surface will be emphatically studied. To quantify how the rear surface morphology affects the optical characteristics in the targeted bifacial PERCs when  Table 1 The main input parameters for the Quokka 2 simulations.

Fig. 3(b) plots the reflection curve against wavelength for four different A F  values (i.e. different rear surface morphologies). The impact of rear surface is distinct in the wavelength range from 900 nm to 1100 nm. Meanwhile, the performance in short wavelength range is identical, since its reflection is mainly determined by the structures and antire - flection coatings of front surface, which is the same for these samples. Obviously, the reflection of nearly planar samples (A F  ¼1.068) exceeds that of the other samples significantly in the long wavelength range, indicating a higher reabsorption of long wavelength photons. Reflection decreases with increasing A F  value. The lowest long wavelength reflection can be observed for the case of highest value of A F , and the corresponding surface displays the highest transmission loss in Fig. 3(c), which are detrimental for the re-utilization of long wavelength photons, despite the transmission losses are two orders of magnitude lower than the reflection losses. The two sets with A F  values of 1.108 and 1.068 show similar lower transmittance. The reflection performance when illuminated from rear side was also assessed, as shown in Fig. 3(d). Reflection decreases significantly with increasing A F  value, indicating more trapped photons and higher J sc  value. The above results demonstrate that superior optical performance is achieved on a planar rear surface when light comes from the front side, while worst light trapping ability is also performed on a planar surface when illuminated from the rear side. The optimal rear surface  Table 2 Average experimental electrical parameters.

Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  morphology is uncertain just considering the optical property of semi- device. Hence, the four rear surface morphologies were further inte - grated into bifacial PERCs to evaluate which rear surface morphology is optimal for bifacial application. 3.3.Characteristics of 5BB bifacial PERCs The bifacial PERCs featuring different rear surface structures were developed to assess the impact of rear surface on their electrical per - formance. The bifacial PERCs were measured using a non-reflective black cloth on rear side when light came from front side, the same test method when illuminated from back side. Fig. 4(a) presents the measured front-side and rear-side current density-voltage (J-V) param - eters. The V oc  steadily increases with the decreased A F  values when illuminated from front side and rear side, as predicted by the trend of iV oc  shown in Fig. 3(a). The average V oc  of nearly planar samples (A F  ¼1.068) reaches 680.6 mV, an absolute increment of 3.3 mV compared to the cells with an A F  value of 1.621. The thicker the Al-BSF, the lower the contact recombination, thus higher V oc  value of cells [39]. While the thickness of Al-BSF shown in Fig. 2(a3–d3) is independent of rear sur - face morphology, thus the increased V oc  for cells with a lower A F  value can be attributed to the decreased surface area and surface recombina - tion velocity. The difference of 7–8 mV in the observed V oc  between front side and rear side will be illustrated by analyzing electrical losses in the following Sec. 3.5. Meanwhile, the J sc  exhibits an opposite ten - dency when illuminated from front side and rear side, improving from 40.29 mA/cm 2  to 40.51 mA/cm 2  and decreasing from 31.82 mA/cm 2  to 30.38 mA/cm 2  with reducing A F  from 1.621 to 1.068, respectively, which is consistent with preceding reflectance and transmittance spectra analysis in Fig. 3(b–d). The FF values remain a high level of about 81%. For nearly planar samples (A F  ¼1.068), an average front-side    of 22.26% is achieved, which is 0.24% higher than the cells with an A F  value of 1.621 due to superior passivation quality and improved long-wavelength response. In contrast, the rear-side    value decreases from 17.33% to 16.66% when A F  drops from 1.621 to 1.068, which is ascribed to the sharply decreased J sc  values. The relatively lower rear-side    is mainly limited by lower J sc  values compared to that of front-side. Under the premise of ensuring excellent rear surface passiv - ation, the J sc  value can be further improved by optimizing antireflection property of rear passivation layers. The bifacial PERCs with an A F  value of 1.621 exhibit the highest bifaciality of 78.70%, with a front-side and rear-side    of 22.02% and 17.33%, respectively. The lowest bifaciality of 74.84% is obtained for bifacial PERCs with an A F  value of 1.068. The average electrical parameters of bifacial PERCs with different rear sur - faces are summarized in Table 2. In order to investigate the different electrical performances of the bifacial PERCs with various rear surface morphologies, Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the EQE spectra when the bifacial PERCs are irradiated from front side and rear side, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the EQE spectra exist difference mainly in the long wavelength range (850–1100 nm) (shown in the inset) but little change in the middle and short wavelength range. This suggests that the different front-side electrical results (Fig. 4(a)) are derived from the rear passivation quality and rear current generation ability, rather than the bulk and emitter region.

Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Additionally, the trend of EQE spectra in the long wavelength range is in accordance with the experimental V oc  and J sc  variation in Fig. 4(a). The EQE spectra when illuminated from rear side were also measured as shown in Fig. 4(c). The short-wavelength EQE performance is obviously inferior to that of Fig. 4(b), where the value of EQE approaches 100% in a wide wavelength range. This can be used to illustrate the nearly one fourth lower rear-side J sc  values than those of front side. The EQE per - formance improves significantly with the increased A F  (i.e. increased roughness of rear surface and light trapping ability), which is consistent with the observed rear-side J sc  values in Fig. 4(a). 3.4.Electrical results of 9BB bifacial PERCs MBB technology has attracted considerable attention because of the decreased series resistance and metal shading area [30]. The bifacial PERCs with different rear surface morphologies were also implemented by applying a 9BB design of metal grid. The tested J-V electrical pa - rameters were shown in Fig. 5, the tendency of which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 4(a), here no further analysis is presented. The increased J sc  is observed for 9BB design compared to 5BB one due to shallower shading area and improved carrier collection ability. The se - ries resistance decreases from 2.00 m (5BB) to 1.86 m (9BB), leading to the increase of FF. The bifacial PERCs with an A F  value of 1.068 achieve the highest front-side average efficiency of 22.57% (V oc  ¼680.8 mV, J sc  ¼40.95 mA/cm 2 , FF ¼80.96%). A highest bifaciality of 78.67% is obtained for cells with an A F  value of 1.621, with a front-side and rear-side average efficiency of 22.27% and 17.52%, respectively. The electrical results are also summarized in Table 2. 3.5.Electrical loss analysis The Quokka 2 simulation was performed to theoretically analyze the impact of rear surface structures on electrical losses, and FELA at maximum power point was illustrated. In order to carry out an accurate simulation, the experimental parameters in Table 1, such as junction depth, R sh , J 0,emitter , J 0,contact  and so on, were adopted in the simulations. The J 0,passivated  values extracted from WCT-120 measurements as listed in Table 2 are 104.12, 73.47, 39.68 and 23.15 fA/cm 2  for cells with an A F  value of 1.621, 1.243, 1.108 and 1.068, respectively. FELA results comprise of recombination losses and resistive losses. According to Fig. 6(a), when light comes from the front side, the recombination loss of rear passivated area decreases sharply with declined A F  value. When the A F  value is 1.621, the proportion of recombination loss resulted from rear passivated area ranks the third only behind the emitter resistive loss and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination loss, while it is negligible as A F  value decreases to 1.068, leading to a decrease of the total effi - ciency loss. When the cells are illuminated from rear side, the resistive loss of electron bulk, the recombination losses of SRH and contact at BSF in Fig. 6(b) increase significantly compared to that in Fig. 6(a). Together with the measured EQE spectra in Fig. 4(c), these can be used to explain the 7–8 mV lower rear-side V oc  values compared to that of front side. As a result, the efficiency losses of rear side become worse. Moreover, the negative impact of enlarged surface area is more distinct for rear side than front side. When comparing the cells with an A F  value of 1.621 and 1.068, a difference of 1.25 mW/cm 2  can be deduced for the rear side, while the front side only have a difference of 0.47 mW/cm 2 . The front-side and rear-side relative    values are also shown for both the 5BB and 9BB design in Fig. 6(c) and (d), respectively, with regarding the cells with an A F  value of 1.621 as the reference. The experimental and simulated front-side conversion efficiency increases gradually as the A F  value decreases, which is consistent with the trend of simulated ef - ficiency loss. In contrast, although a decreased A F  value indicates the better passivation quality, the rear-side conversion efficiency still de - creases sharply, this is mainly ascribed to the drastically reduced J sc  values. The slight difference between experimental and simulated rela - tive efficiency value can be attributed to several reasons. The thickness of silicon substrate was kept constant in simulations, while it may be influenced by the different etching behaviors. Moreover, the rounding effect in pyramid peaks was ignored, and only the pyramid facet angle was used to represent different rear surface structures. 3.6.Electric energy production simulation The J-V parameters shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 5 were tested under the standard conditions, with a temperature of 25  � C and irradiance intensity of 1000 W/m 2 , while the irradiance intensity can be varying since the sun goes from east to west over a day. Fig. 7(a) presents the solar spectrum irradiance varying with time on June 22nd in Shanghai. Moreover, the electric energy production of module is strongly associ - ated with the ratio of direct and diffuse light, the albedo of ground and the mounting heights [29], thus simulations of energy yield were  Fig. 5.Experimental J-V parameters of the fabricated bifacial PERCs with a 9BB design for metal grid (about 800 cells for each group).   H.B. Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  indispensable for above fabricated bifacial PERCs to compare their performances in practical applications. Since the bifacial PERCs collect extra diffuse light reflected from the ground, the different ground albedo values depending on module installation surroundings have a significant influence on electric energy generation. Fig. 7(b) shows the calculated relative enhancement of energy production over a day for bifacial PERCs with different A F  values, with regarding the set with an A F  value of 1.621 as reference. When the albedo is 10%, for example, asphalt floor, the lower the A F  value is, the more output energy can be generated. The maximum relative enhancement can reach 0.73% for the solar cells with an A F  value of 1.068. When the modules are located in normal grassland, an albedo of around 20%, the tendency of relative enhancement is similar to the situation of an albedo value of 10%, while the gap among different bifacial PERCs becomes narrower. The solar cells with an A F  value of 1.621, 1.243, 1.108 own comparable electric energy production if the albedo is 30%. When the albedo value further increases to 40% (e. g., sand), the energy generation performance is enhanced with increasing the A F  value. An albedo higher than 40% can be obtained on white roofing metal, light-gray roofing membrane and white-painted concrete. An albedo of up to 60%–80% is even possible on aluminum foil and snowfield, under this condition an increase in electric energy production of 0.50%–0.81% was predicted for bifacial PERCs with an A F  value of 1.621 compared to that of 1.068. In summary, the bifacial PERCs with a nearly planar rear surface (A F  ¼1.068) is recommended if the ground albedo is lower than 30%. The bifacial PERCs with four different rear surfaces can generate compara - tive electric energy if the albedo is between 30% and 40%. Under the case of albedo higher than 40%, solar cells with rougher rear surface (A F  ¼1.621) is preferable to apply in such conditions. 4.Conclusions In conclusion, we have investigated the impact of rear surface morphology on the performance of bifacial p-Si PERCs both experi - mentally and theoretically. By adjusting the concentration of etching acid solution, the bifacial PERCs with four different rear surface  Fig. 6.Simulated FELA results for (a) front-side and (b) rear-side.

Tang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  morphologies were firstly fabricated with a 5BB metal grid. A smoother rear surface has been proved to be advantageous in passivation property, and an increment in front-side V oc  of 3.3 mV was achieved with reducing A F  value from 1.621 to 1.068. The invariable thickness of Al-BSF demonstrated that the difference of V oc  was independent of rear Al–Si contact. A more flattend rear surface possesses superior optical charac - teristic due to improved long-wavelength response when illuminated from front side. Meanwhile, a rougher surface is more beneficial when light comes from the rear side attributed to improved light trapping ability. Further integrating these rear surface structures into 9BB bifacial p-Si PERCs, a similar trend was observed. Attributed to the reduced metal shadowing and series resistance, the increased J sc  and FF values were obtained for 9BB design compared to 5BB one. Consequently, the cells with an A F  value of 1.068 achieved the highest front-side average efficiency of 22.57%, with a champion efficiency of 22.75% (V oc  683.0 mV, J sc  41.03 mA/cm 2 , FF 81.19%). The highest bifaciality of 78.67% was achieved for cells with an A F  value of 1.621, with an average front-side and rear-side efficiency of 22.27% and 17.52%, respectively. Simulated electrical loss analysis indicated that the nega - tive influence of increased J 0,passivated  values was more serious for rear- side electrical performance than that of front-side. Finally, by calcu - lating the relative enhancement of energy generation in practical application, the bifacial p-Si PERCs with an A F  value of 1.068 was rec - ommended to install in surroundings with ground albedo lower than 30%. Nevertheless, cells with an A F  value of 1.621 were preferable if the albedo value was higher than 40%.

ARTICLE INFO   Keywords: Photovoltaic Floating systems Bifacial modules Geometric optimization Models comparison PV software tools  ABSTRACT   The aim of this study is to create usable commercial simulation software tools for photovoltaic (PV) systems even in the case of floating applications. Using the experimental data of a plant installed at the “Enel Innovation Lab” in Catania (IT), adequate heat exchange coefficients of the software’s thermal models were found, which allowed us to take into account the thermal effects for these types of installations. An optimization of the sizes for mono- and bifacial floating systems was carried out. The simulated data for a ground system were compared with the floating data through performance indices. In addition, monofacial models were compared with bifacial. The optimized variables are the tilt angle and the pitch, whereas for the bifacial systems, the module elevation is also considered. The albedo is a sensitive factor mainly for the bifacial modules, so it was considered a parameter in the different design solutions. The simulations were performed by two specialized commercial software pro - grams, where different PV system models are implemented. The normalized annual energy yield was chosen as a meaningful parameter with which to compare the different solutions. As the analysis of PV systems is highly site dependent, the study was developed for two locations, characterized by different diffuse and albedo solar irra - diance components, specifically at high latitudes (Frankfurt, DE) and at intermediate latitudes (Catania, IT).    1.Introduction One of the indicators used to measure the welfare of a country is electricity consumption because the majority of the energy produced every day by power plants is consumed by industry, and if it more en - ergy, it means that there is more goods production and an increase in the country’s economy. With globalization and new market growth, in recent years, energy demand has increased. World electricity generation grew by 2.8% in 2017 [1], and production cannot rely exclusively on fossil fuel resources due to the pollution derived from their use. It is possible to use renewable sources, such as photovoltaics, but they have some problems, such as low power density. To increase efficiency, systems with high-performance photovoltaic modules, such as bifacial modules, can be implemented and installed with methods that increase their efficiency, such as floating. Bifacial PV modules can boost the performance of PV plants by 25–30% (and even more using reflecting solutions) depending on their electrical behaviour, mounting structures and terrain characteristics [2]. They are perceived as the technology that can be used for future solar power plants as they increase energy yield at a marginally higher cost. The efficiency of the bifacial modules depends on the temperature which therefore changes the energy yield and the LCOE by about 10–15% as demonstrated in [3].  *Corresponding author.

In fact, multiple advantages of these installations have been reported in the literature. Some of these configurations are favourable for bifacial modules. Floating photovoltaic projects are growing in both number and scale. Since 2015, more than 100 plants have begun operation worldwide as top hydropower reservoirs, industrial water sites, aquaculture ponds and other water bodies [4]. The benefits of putting solar modules into main water bodies include increased economic output per unit of land, improved output (likely due to the cooling effect of water on solar panels) and reduced water evaporation. Japan leads in the number of floating plants, due in part to the country’s FIT policy combined with the limited roof and ground space for solar PV systems [5]. Other countries with projects include China, with approximately 400 MW of floating capacity, India, the Republic of Korea and Brazil; Brazil’s first floating project was completed in 2017 [6]. In addition to classic applications on lakes and reservoirs, floating systems can also be installed offshore, as suggested in [7], or integrated with hydroelectric plants [8]. A solution that exploits the synergy between water-food-energy (WFE) has been proposed in the literature, and consists in implementing a floating photovoltaic-hydroelectric hybrid system in which there is the possi - bility of creating fish farms [9]. Other applications similar to FPVs, which have their own benefits, are “Canal top solar systems”, installed on rivers and water channels in which there are favourable microclimate conditions that help increase efficiency and reduce the degradation rate of modules [10]. The performance prediction of a photovoltaic system is very important both in the design phase to facilitate its realization and assess its feasibility and in the operational phase to solve any problems due to the malfunction of the system components [11]. For PV performance prediction, there are a lot of simulation software that basically catego - rized in, economic evaluation tools, analysis and planning tools, moni - toring and control tools, solar radiation maps and some other online software [12]. The most popular software programs in recent years are PVSYST, HOMER, SAM (System Advisor Model), PVSOL, TRNSYS, Solar Pro and many others mentioned in [13]. Given the considerable number of software tools that basically have the same purpose but calculate the variables involved in a photovoltaic system in different ways, it is necessary to understand how they are calculated, the differences that exist between them and the error made against measured data. The variables on which the power produced depends are manifold but are mainly meteorological variables and the temperature of the photovoltaic modules. For the latter, to obtain reli - able results from the models, we must take into account the technology (mono-polycrystalline, amorphous heterojunction etc.), the character - istics of the module (monofacial, bifacial, glass-glass or glass-backsheet) [14], the type of installation (free with air circulation, semi integrated, with insulated rear part, on roofs, on water, etc.) [15]. In fact, at the STC reference temperature (25  ◦ C), crystalline PV technologies have typical power temperature coefficients of between 0.003  ◦ C �1  and 0.005  ◦ C �1  for monocrystalline, 0.004  ◦ C �1  for polycrystalline and between 0.0011  ◦ C �1  and 0.0026  ◦ C �1  for amorphous PV technologies [16]. Many models for PV modelling, and, therefore, the power produced by it, have been proposed over the years [17], but in this case, it is necessary to use the most suitable model in relation to the technology and characteristics of the PV modules [18]. From a careful bibliographic analysis, it has been noted that there is a gap regarding the existence of commercial software suitable for modelling floating photovoltaic systems. The arguments for which the treatment of floating systems can be different from normal systems, in principle, are the following: - The temperature of the modules. Due to evaporation and the local microclimate, the ambient temperature near the modules may be slightly lower than the temperature measured in the soil area. Therefore, to take into account the natural cooling of the modules, it is necessary to adequately choose the heat exchange coefficients of the temperature models used by the software. - The albedo. The albedo of a water body is very low (0.1, which is much lower than the normal value of 0.2 for soil). For large monofacial installations, the albedo is not significant, as it is only “seen” from the first row of modules. For bifacial systems, this property is not true since the back of modules also captures solar radiation.

Tina et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Therefore, the objective of this work is to make two commercial software tools accessible through appropriate adjustments in the models for applications in water. For this reason, it was necessary to compare the models with experimental data to obtain the correct value of the heat transfer coef - ficient for a thermal model used in the software in the case of floating systems. Moreover, the purpose of this study is to find the optimal geometric configuration for a floating photovoltaic system in relation to the geo - metric variables, albedo values and installation location. In this work, we compare, both in terms of power and temperature of the modules, two commercial software programs used for the study of photovoltaic systems to verify the reliability of the data obtained, even in the case of applications of floating photovoltaic systems. For this goal, a system installed on an artificial basin was monitored at the Enel Innovation Lab in Catania (Italy), which allowed us to compare the experimental data with the model results. The novelty of this study is the use of commercial software for floating applications, particularly to simulate the optimization of the energy collected (optimal geometrical design) in relation to the geo - metric configuration, as well as the evaluation of the performance of the bifacial modules. The comparison in terms of the power and temperature of a cell between the software models and the experimental data of a floating system is also a novelty. To obtain the temperature data of the models compatible with those of a floating system, which enjoys natural cooling due to the favourable microclimate conditions, the thermal models were calibrated, and appropriate values of the heat exchange coefficients were chosen. In doing so, commercial software was made available, even for floating systems. This paper is organized as described below: -In Section 2, the characteristics of the studied system are illustrated, it corresponds to the one installed in EGP laboratories from which the experimental data and the geometric parameters have been obtained; -In Section 3, the experimental data obtained from the floating photovoltaic system installed in Catania, IT, with the data obtained from the models from the two software packages csw1 and csw2 are compared. Therefore, the models of the two csw programs in the case of mono- and bifacial systems with the experimental data in terms of both the power and temperature of the modules are compared. The objective is to find the heat transfer coefficients of the temperature models of the mono and bifacial modules, suitable for installations of floating systems, through a MATLAB optimization algorithm that minimizes the RMSE between the measured and calculated data. In the second part of the section are compared models for mono and bifacial modules used by the two software csw1 and csw2 for two different locations (Catania IT, Frankfurt D) to make a critical analysis of the results. Moreover, the optimal geometric configuration in relation to the energy produced and compared with the systems on the ground in terms of energy yield compared to the floating systems is calculated. 2.Sites and photovoltaic systems data The PV floating system analysed consists of two floating PV fields, one made of monofacial modules and the other made of bifacial mod - ules. The PV systems studied in this paper are realized at the experi - mental site of the Enel Innovation Lab (Enel Green Power) in Catania (Italy). The system simulations are developed by two software tools, here - inafter referred to as csw1 and csw2, while data processing was per - formed in the MATLAB environment. 2.1.Characteristics of the system components Each field, whose rated power is 3.84 kW for the monofacial modules and 4.14 kW for the bifacial modules, has 12 modules, divided into 2 strings that are connected to a multi-string inverter equipped with separate MPP trackers. The configuration and connection of the strings is shown in Fig. 1, where they are highlighted with different colours (light blue and dark blue for the monofacial modules and light grey and dark grey for the bifacial modules). The characteristics of the PV mod - ules are shown in Table 1, and those of the inverter are shown in Table 2. 2.2.Site characteristics The optimization study of the geometry of a floating system has been developed for two sites: one at high latitudes (Frankfurt, DE) and one with intermediate latitudes (Catania, IT). Data on solar radiation only for the “Monofacial vs bifacial models comparison and optimization” and “Software comparison”, were taken from the Meteonorm database, with a one-hour step for the entire year and are shown in Table 3. As regards the comparison of the models with the experimental data, refer to the “Calibration of models” paragraph, where the analysis carried out are described in detail. The waves and wind effects on the water surface substantially change the surface structure, raising its reflectivity [19]; in this regard, simu - lations were performed at different albedo values. During the simula - tions, the albedo was assumed to be a constant, since in most cases, these systems are installed at sites where the presence of waves is limited. It is clear that when there is a noticeable rippling of the surface of the water, the phenomenon of the diffusion of the reflected radiation is generated; therefore, considering a constant albedo is no longer possible. These two sites were chosen to evaluate the behaviour of the bifacial modules at different latitudes, where the percentage of diffuse hori - zontal irradiance (DHI) with respect to the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is different. In this regard, the diffuse irradiance factor f d  can be defined as follows: · × = ∗÷⋄±÷⋄(1) Higher values of f d would cause an increase in bifacial module pro - duction since it would receive more rear-side irradiation [20]. Specif - ically, f d  is equal to 0.329 in Catania and 0.511 in Frankfurt. 2.3.Geometric variables The simulations were carried out by changing the three geometrical parameters of the PV systems, graphically described in Fig. 2. Specif - ically, the pitch, d r , is normalized with respect to the length of the module, L (the dimension of the PV module perpendicular to the row direction); for bifacial systems, the height from the surface of the water, h w,  is also considered. The optimization variables assume discrete values. Table 4 reports the lower and upper bounds of the variables and the number of steps. Both in the design phase and in the estimation of the performance of a floating system, it is appropriate to take into account the impact of wind and waves stresses on the floating structure.

Tina et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  characteristics of the basin [21]. The energy performances could change if the geometric variables, such as tilt and the azimuth angles, change during the passage of the waves under the floating structure. As for azimuth angle, thanks to the use of effective mooring solu - tions, for instance by elastic mooring systems [21] the effect on pro - duction in relation to the change of orientation of a few degrees is negligible. The effect on tilt of the passage of a wave is reported in Fig. 3, at the beginning the pontoon is in a horizontal condition and the angle of incidence between the normal to the module and the solar beam is  0 , subsequently, at the wave passage, the pontoon tilts and the angle of incidence becomes  0  + waves , in the next phase it tilts an angle opposite to the previous one and the angle of incidence is  0 - waves  and finally in the last phase it returns to the state of quiet with angle of incidence  0 . Under the assumption that the PV system is working at maximum power point, as a first approximation, the PV power is, proportional to the irradiance, so there is linear dependency between Power and G. Under this assumption the global effect of the variation of the tilt angle on the energy production is nil. On the other hand, the impact of the variation of the temperature due to the variation of G can be neglected due to the thermal inertia of the PV module and the frequency of the wave phenomenon. The impact of tilt variation is also dependent on the type of floating structure [22], since in case of rigid floating platforms the waves affect the orientation of the whole PV system, whereas in case of no rigid floating systems some PV modules can undergo to a local angle varia - tion. In this case a mismatch of irradiance among modules that belong to the same string can determine losses [23]. In the final analysis it is important to emphasize that usually floating photovoltaics are designed for water basins where there are favourable climatic conditions (low wind and waves). Whereas for offshore appli - cations, both from the point of view of the high demanding mechanical design of the structures and of duration of the components (reduced due to the salty ambient), it may not be convenient [24]. Moreover, in the latter case, appropriate simulation models may be needed for perfor - mance evaluation [25]. 2.4.Comparison indices A performance comparison between mono- and bifacial systems is critical due to both different definitions of rated power and converted  Table 1 PV modules characteristics.

In this paper, first, the yearly energy yield Y’, in kWh, is evaluated (it is the sum of hourly average power values under the hypothesis that the system works at maximum power point, MPP, see (2) and (2 ′ )), then it is normalized with respect to peak power, in kW. The subscripts m and b indicate the monofacial system and the bifacial system, respectively: ∓ ⊕ =∑ ⊖⊗=0 ⊘ ⊕⊙⊙,⊕ (⊗)	⊗⊘ ⊕⊙⊙,⊕ = ∓’ ⊕ ⊘ ⊕⊙⊙,⊕ (2)  ∓ © =∑ ⊖⊗=0 ⊘ ⊕⊙⊙,©(⊗)	⊗ ⊘ ⊕⊙⊙,b = ∓’ © ⊘ ⊕⊙⊙,© (2′) It is worth noting that Y’ b  is normalized with respect to the front-side module power P mpp,b . The bifacial gain, BF (in %), is defined as: ◦•=100 ∓ © �∓ ⊕ ∓ ⊕ (3) The BF is used to evaluate the energy gain of a bifacial system compared to a monofacial system. The comparison of the performance between the ground and floating systems is important for evaluating the actual increase in energy pro - duced. To evaluate this increase, we calculated the floating gain (FG). The floating gain FG, in %, is defined as: •±=100 ∓ ·≍ �∓ ≡⊆ ∓ ≡⊆ (4) The FG is used to compare the producibility of a floating system compared to a ground system. The ground system is taken as a reference, in which the heat exchange coefficients of the thermal models are those usually used for free mounted systems with air circulation and are compared with the floating systems whose heat exchange coefficients of the thermal models are those obtained for the floating experimental plant installed at the “Enel Innovation Lab” of Enel Green Power in Catania (IT) at section “Calibration of models”. 3.Optimization and models comparison In this section, the models of the mono and bifacial systems will be compared, and an optimization of the producibility with respect to the geometric variables of the photovoltaic system will be carried out. The used software programs for simulations are respectively: PVsyst (csw1), which is a commercial software specialized for sizing and analysis of PV systems and SAM (csw2) which is a free techno-economic software that facilitates decision-making for people in the renewable energy industry. The two programs have been chosen as they are more common on the market and to give the possibility of use to users of paid or free licenses. Furthermore, among the software tools on the market, used for calcu - lating the performance of the PV systems, these give the possibility of simulating also bifacial PV systems. To verify the reliability of both software also in the case of bifacial systems, a comparison between the models used by the two software was made and the results are reported in Section 3.2. 3.1.Calibration of models To adapt the software models to the floating applications, the experimental data were compared with the models of the two software programs, csw1 and csw2, where the following geometric configuration was considered: d r /L =1.55,  Mm/b  =20 ◦ and h w  =0.4 m. The heat exchange coefficients of the models, which minimized the error with respect to the measured data, both in terms of temperature and esti - mated power, were obtained. The characteristics of the system shown in Fig. 4 are described in ’SITES AND PV SYSTEMS DATA’. The PV module temperature, current, voltage and DC and AC power produced by the two systems were measured as well as the environmental variables. Specifically, ambient temperature, diffuse and global solar irradiance, and wind speed are the inputs of the software used to simulate the systems. These data were collected by the meteorological station (Fig. 5) run by Enel Green Power. It is positioned (37 ◦ 24 ′ 41.4 “N 15 ◦ 02 ′ 38.4 ′′ E, IT) near the perimeter of the reservoir where the floating photovoltaic system is installed. The characteristics of the measuring instruments are described in Table 5. Two clear-sky days (13 and 14 July 2019) and two cloudy days (15 and 16 July 2019) were chosen to test the software. The environmental data are measured every minute, but considering the hourly analysis performed by the two software tools, the measured data are hourly averaged. The measured meteorological variables and their hourly averaged values are shown in Fig. 6.  Fig. 4.Experimental floating power plant.   Fig. 5.Meteorological station.   G.M.

The root mean square error (RMSE), percentage error of estimate (PE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) are defined as: ⊇≤≥≼=̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ ∑ ⊖≽=1 (⊘ ≽ �∼ ≽ ) 2 ⊖√√√√√(5)  ⊘≼=100⃒⃒⃒⃒ ⊘ ⊕≈⊂⊖ �∼ ⊕≈⊂⊖ ∼ ⊕≈⊂⊖ ⃒⃒⃒⃒(6)  ≤⊃≼=⃒⃒⃒⃒ ∑ ⊖≽=1 (⊘ ≽ �∼ ≽ )⊖⃒⃒⃒⃒(7)  ⊇ 2 = [∑ ⊖≽=1 (⊘ ≽ �⊘ ⊕≈⊂⊖ )(∼ ≽ �∼ ⊕≈⊂⊖ )] 2 ∑ ⊖≽=1 (⊘ ≽ �⊘ ⊕≈⊂⊖ ) 2 ∑ ⊖≽=1 (∼ ≽ �∼ ⊕≈⊂⊖ ) 2 (8) where P i  and O i  are the predicted and observed values, respectively. The subscript “mean” indicates the mean value of the variable, and the letter “n” indicates the number of values examined. 3.1.2.Thermal models validation In this paragraph, the temperature of the back of both the mono- and bifacial modules measured in the experimental system are compared with the cell temperature calculated by the two software packages csw1 and csw2. The cell temperature of csw1 is calculated using Eq. (9) [26], while the cell temperature calculated by csw2 is carried out using Eqs. (10) and (11) [27]. ≪ ⊙≫ =≪+ ≺ ± ≪ (1� ≻ ⊆≈· )← 0 +← 1 → ≫ (9) where U 0  and U 1  depend on the type of installation. ≪ ⊙≫ =≪ ⊕ + ± ≪ 1000	≪ ⊙≫�©↑ (10) where T m  of Eq.

(9) and (10) starting from the temperature values measured in the real system installed on the lake of Enel Green Power (Enel Innovation Lab of Catania (IT)). For the optimization of the coefficients, the MATLAB function ’fmincon’ was used, the operative variables (U 0 , U 1 , a and b) are forced to vary between lower and upper limits to maintain their physical values and, the optimization function was the minimization of the RMSE (Eq.5) between the measurements and the numerical results. To clarify what is described, an algorithm flow chart is shown in the Fig. 7.

Table 6 shows the statistical indices for mono- and bifacial PV module temperatures calculated by the csw1 and csw2 software tools considering the measurements as a reference. Both in the case of the monofacial and bifacial system, both software are performing. In fact, the correlation coefficients are between 0.98 and 0.97 for csw1 and 0.97 and 0.96 for csw2. The MAE is between 0.77 and 0.94 [  C], RMSE is between 1.27 and 1.55 [  C]. Furthermore, the per - centage error values range from a minimum of 0.43% to a maximum of 1.10%. The statistical values could be even better if we refer to the cell temperature, which cannot be measured unless temperature probes are inserted during the module construction phase. The back-surface temperature is a good approximation of the actual cell temperature, and studies have shown that solar cells typically run 3   C warmer than back-surface temperatures for glass–glass laminate constructions [27]. 3.1.3.Power comparison In this paragraph, the power measured in the experimental systems of both mono- and bifacial modules are compared with the power calculated by csw1 and csw2. From the analysis of the electrical behaviour of the two strings of each system, it has been noted that they show the same behaviour in terms of power production, so for the sake of simplicity, the power of a single string for each system is reported. The comparison power was the upstream of the inverter (DC). The models used by the csw1 software for calculating the power are described in [27], while for the csw2 software are described in [28]. 3.1.3.1.Monofacial PV plant results:.Fig. 10 shows the plot of the measured power on a string of the monofacial system (solid line) and the plots of the power calculated by csw1 and csw2 (dashed lines). It is worth noticing that during clear days the software csw2 underestimates the power. On cloudy days both software are very close to the measured values. 3.1.3.2.Bifacial PV plant results:.Fig. 11 shows the plot of the measured power on a string of the bifacial system (solid line) and the plots of the power calculated by csw1 and csw2 (dashed lines). It is worth noting that during clear days, csw1 overestimates the power. On cloudy days, the calculated values of both software programs are very close to the measured values. Table 7 shows the statistical indices for the power calculated for the csw1 and csw2 software tools and taking the measurements as a reference. From the statistical analysis it can be seen that the two software, both in the case of monofacial and bifacial systems, are very performing. In fact, the correlation coefficients are between 0.97 and 0.98 for csw1 and csw2. The MAE is between 51.97 and 55.03 [W], RMSE is between 83.86 and 98.14 [W]. Furthermore, the percentage error values range from a minimum of 1.14% to a maximum of 4.71%. 3.2.Software comparison The purpose of this paragraph is to compare the quantities obtained by the two software in order to calculate the differences in the results, and evaluate the possibility to continue with the study, through the use of a single software. Fig. 12 shows a logic diagram that accompany the two software. To this aim a comparison about modeling bifacial systems between the software csw1 (indicated by 1) and csw2 (indicated by 2), is per - formed. In this case only one-row PV array layout is considered. The simulations were carried out at h w  0 m and a 20%. The objective of this analysis is also to understand to which param - eter attribute any differences. As it is possible to notice in Table 8 and Table 9, due to the incli - nation of the module  M  equal to zero, both software lead to similar results, with a difference of EArrNom of 3.9% and 2.6% for Catania and Frankfurt respectively. This shows that the use of one rather than the other software in the case of monofacial systems (zero inclination,  Table 6 Statistical indices of mono- and bifacial PV module temperatures calculated by the models implemented in csw1 and csw2.

For inclinations greater than zero (bifacial systems), the difference in energy calculation (EArrNom) between the two software is between 3.3% (for  M  20  ) and 4.7% (for  M  40  ). From this evaluation we can safely proceed with the use of a single software for the geometric optimization and comparison between the mono and bifacial models as the 	 value are less than 5%. After the comparison between the two software programs, we have chosen to proceed only with csw1 because it provides a tool that performs a sensitivity analysis respect with the main variables that can affect the yearly production. The calculated final energy results can be attributed to the different calculation methods, module losses and incident solar energy on the front and back of PV modules [29]. Regarding the thermal losses, the thermal models of PV modules used in the two software tools are different; in fact, csw2 uses a module loss calculation metric that is the heat transfer method [28], while csw1 uses another heat transfer method [27]. 3.3.Monofacial vs bifacial models comparison and optimization In this section, the optimal geometrical design of PV systems is performed by the csw1 software. The objective of the problem is the maximization of the yearly normalized energy, Y, whereas the operative variables are the geometrical variables reported in Table 4. The albedo is considered a parameter. The model of the PV system is bi-dimensional, and it has been assumed that the shed layout is made of 40 rows. The electrical losses due to near shading are taken into account in the evaluation of Y, considering 3 bypass diodes in each PV module. For the bifacial model, mismatch losses on the back of the module equal 2.5% and losses due to the shading of the structures equal 2.5% were considered. Furthermore, a 10% shed transparent fraction was considered. For each location, indices were calculated with which the bifacial modules are compared with the monofacial modules and, again, the floating systems with those on the ground.

From the results, there is no 	Y m % when the albedo varies (moving horizontally in Table 10), while for different configurations in which the tilt has been optimized to vary the pitch, the producibility increases up to 7%. This finding demonstrates the fact that monofacial systems, if the albedo variability is relatively small, are not very sensitive to this parameter. The energy gain of a floating system (FG) compared to a ground system varies from 4.5 to 4.8%. Fig. 14 is a graphic illustration of the energy yield of the operation of the plant as a function of the geometric variables for a ground system.

Table 11 shows the variation in producibility with albedo. It is reduced but more evident than in the monofacial system (moving hor - izontally in Table 11), while for the different configurations in which the tilt has been optimized when the pitch changes, the producibility in - creases up to 12% (moving vertically in Table 11). The FG of the floating system for the bifacial system shown in Table 11 varies between 7.0 and 7.3%. The results for h w  0.9 m are shown in Table 12, taking the following configuration as a reference (a 5%): d r /L 1.25,  Mb  10  , Y b-gr  1634 h, and Y b-fl  1749 h. Table 12 shows that for the first two d r /L values moving horizontally (as the albedo varies), the increase in producibility is reduced, while for the last d r /L values, always moving horizontally, the variation begins to become more significant. For the different configurations in which the tilt has been optimized as d r /L changes, the producibility increases up to 14%. The FG for the bifacial system shown in Table 12 varies between 7.0 and 7.3%.

At 20% albedo, the BF reaches 7.5% for the ground system and 9.9% for the floating system. Table 14 shows that for h w  0.9, for an albedo equal to 5%, the BF reaches 4.4%, and for a 20%, the BF reaches 10% for the ground system and 6.6% and 12.5% for the floating systems. 3.3.2.Frankfurt Optimal configuration for the monofacial system: The results for 	Y m  % are shown in Table 15, taking the following configuration as a reference  Table 10 Optimal configuration for the monofacial system (Catania).   d r /L  Mm  a (%) 20 10 5 20 10 5 20 10 5 20 10 5 Y m-gr  Y m-fl  	Y m-gr-fl  (%) FG (%) 1.25 10 1588 1587 1587 1663 1663 1663 100 100 100 4.5 4.6 4.6 1.4 15 1627 1626 1626 1706 1706 1706 102 102 102  4.6  4.7  4.7 1.55 20 1655 1654 1654 1737 1737 1737 104 104 104  4.7  4.8  4.8 1.7 20 1673 1672 1672 1756 1756 1756 105 105 105  4.7  4.8  4.8 1.85 25 1687 1686 1686 1771 1770 1770 106 106 106  4.7  4.7  4.7 2 25 1694 1693 1692 1778 1778 1778 107 107 107  4.7  4.8  4.8   Fig. 14.Energy yield and the optimal configuration (in red) of a monofacial system for different  Mm  and d r /L values at a 20% in Catania.

(a 5%): d r /L 1.25,  Mm  10  , Y m-gr  933 h, and Y m-fl  966 h Similar considerations made regarding the Catania case can be made here. In this case, the producibility 	Y is increased up to 6%. The energy gain of a floating system (FG) compared to a ground system varies from 3.3 to 3.6%. Fig. 16 is a graphic illustration of the energy yield of operation of the plant as a function of the geometric variables for the ground system. Optimal configuration for the bifacial system: The results for 	Y b % are shown in Table 16, taking the following configuration as a reference (a 5%); d r /L 1.25,  Mm  10  , Y b-gr  960 h, and Y b-fl  1012 h. For h w  0 (Table 16), when the albedo varies with the same geo - metric configuration, there are no significant increases in energy, while moving vertically, there is an increase of up to 11% of energy (	Y) for ground system and 12% for floating system. The variation in 	Y (moving horizontally in the Table 16) is important but still limited. By comparing the 	Y values as a function of the albedo in Tables 15 and 16, it is noted that the bifacial system is much more sensitive to this latter parameter than the monofacial. The energy gain of the floating system (FG) compared to the ground system varies from 5.3 to 5.8%. Similar considerations made regarding the Catania case can be made here, but in this case, also moving horizontally, there is considerable energy variation, perhaps because for places at high latitudes, the albedo is more important since the back of the module works mainly with diffuse radiation, which surely has a higher percentage in Frankfurt than in Catania. Moving horizontally in Table 17 for values of d r /L 2, it is noted that the 	Y varies twice when the albedo passes from 5% to 20%. Therefore, knowing a priori the reflection coefficient of water and its variations throughout the year leads to minimizing the error in esti - mating the performance of a bifacial system (See Tables 18 and 19). The energy gain of the floating system (FG) compared to the ground system varies from 5.3 to 5.8%. Fig. 17 is a graphic illustration of the energy yield of operation of the plant as a function of the geometric variables for the ground system. Bifacial gain: As the results show, for the same system with the same peak power with optimal configuration, the BF more sensitive to the albedo in Frankfurt than in Catania. This is because the back of the module works more with reflected and diffuse radiation. The BF with h w  0 m for ground systems reaches up to 8.2%, while it reaches up to 10.6% for floating systems. The BF with h w  0.9 m for ground systems reaches up to 11.0%, while it reaches up to 13.5% for floating systems. The results highlight the fact that in the presence of more diffuse radiation, bifacial systems increase their energy yield. 4.Conclusion In the present study, heat transfer coefficients of the thermal models from commercial software for the simulation of photovoltaic systems suitable for the installation of floating systems were obtained. This suitability made it possible to create two commercial software packages accessible for applications on water bodies and to compare the systems on the ground with those on the water from an energy point of view. In the second analysis, the optimal configuration of a ground and floating system with mono- and bifacial modules, taking into account the most important geometrical parameters (tilt, pitch, and height from the water) and albedo, was developed. It was shown that with the studied configurations, it is possible to obtain energy gains with bifacial  Table 13 Bifacial gains for h w  0 m.   d r /L  Mb   Mm  a (%) 20 10 5 20 10 5 BF gr  BF fl  1.25 10 10 5.5 3.6 2.6 7.8 5.8 4.9 1.4 15 15  5.8  3.8  2.8  8.2  6.1  5.0 1.55 20 20  6.3  4.1  3.1  8.6  6.4  5.3 1.7 25 20  6.9  4.6  3.5  9.2  6.9  5.7 1.85 25 25  7.1  4.7  3.5  9.4  7.0  5.8 2 30 25  7.5  5.0  3.7  9.9  7.3  6.0   Table 14 Bifacial gains for h w  0.9 m.   d r /L  Mb   Mm  a (%) 20 10 5 20 10 5 BF gr  BF fl  1.25 10 10 6.5 4.1 2.9 8.8 6.4 5.1 1.4 15 15  7.3  4.6  3.2  9.7  6.9  5.4 1.55 20 20  8.1  5.0  3.5  10.6  7.4  5.8 1.7 25 20  8.9  5.6  4.0  11.4  7.9  6.2 1.85 25 25  9.5  5.9  4.1  12.0  8.3  6.4 2 30 25  10.0  6.2  4.4  12.5  8.6  6.6   Table 15 Optimal configuration for the monofacial system.   d r /L  Mm  a (%) 20 10 5 20 10 5 20 10 5 20 10 5 Y m-gr  Y m-fl  	Y m-gr-fl  (%) FG (%) 1.25 10 934 933 933 966 966 966 100 100 100 3.4 3.5 3.5 1.4 15 952 951 951 984 984 984 102 102 102  3.4  3.5  3.5 1.55 20 964 963 963 997 996 996 103 103 103  3.4  3.4  3.4 1.7 20 974 973 973 1007 1007 1007 104 104 104  3.4  3.5  3.5 1.85 20 981 980 980 1015 1015 1015 105 105 105  3.5  3.6  3.6 2 20 988 987 986 1021 1021 1021 106 106 106  3.3  3.4  3.5   Fig. 16.Energy yield and optimal configuration (in red) for the monofacial system for different  Mm  and d r /L values (Frankfurt, DE) for a 20%  G.M. Tina et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  modules, which reach up to 13.5% compared to monofacial configura - tions. Furthermore, for the two studied sites (Catania and Frankfurt), it was noted that in Frankfurt, where the diffusion factor is greater than in Catania, there is a greater bifacial gain. Monofacial systems, unlike bifacial systems, have a lower sensitivity to albedo. The increase in energy 	Y in the bifacial system is greater than that in the monofacial system with the same pitch. At the same pitch, the bifacial system to be optimized, requires a higher tilt than the mono - facial system. For the analysed configurations, the trend of the BF as a function of h w  is exponential and then levels off at 0.9 m, as shown in Figs. 15 and 17. Furthermore, if the pitch is increased up to 2.5 m, the saturation point of h w  will move to 1.5 m, and a BF up to 15% can be obtained with such configurations. Using the heat transfer coefficients for thermal models obtained from the experimental data of the floating plant installed in Catania, we ob - tained a gain of floating systems (FG) between 3.4 and 5.8% for Frankfurt and between 4.5 and 7.3% for Catania. In the case of floating systems, to take into account the natural cooling of the modules due to the favourable microclimate and to obtain more precise results, one needs to use software that allows the tuning of the thermal models in order to consider the cooling of the modules.

Introduction  In  recent years, the bifacial solar module has gained much attention [1]. However, there is currently no commercially available software to model the performance of a bifacial photovoltaic system such as PVSYST photovoltaic software [2]. Modelling the field performance of bifacial modules presents a number of difficulties that  are not present for monofacial modules.   The bifacial system modelling is significantly more complex than the monofacial system modelling due to the need to estimate the rear illumination of the module, which depends on the  percentage of diffused radiation, the sun elevation, the background reflectance, the height of the module above the ground and the module tilt angle. In addition, the field performance of bifacial modules is highly dependent on the  location and system design. In this paper the development of an empirical model for the field performance of a bifacial photovoltaic module is discussed. The model attempts to overcome a number of challenges in modelling the  rear side illumination for different module heights, module tilts, ground albedos, diffuse radiation components  (primarily due to atmospheric effects) and solar positions. 2.   Simulation process flow The simulation process flow for developing a bifacial photovoltaic model in this work is shown in Figure 1. The inputs to the simulation flow chart are module performance details, system installation details and the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data.                             Fig. 1. The bifacial modelling process flow. The GHI data, the module performance details and the system installation details are the inputs. The terrestrial solar calculation and the front side power simulation are used in the primary calculation. The sunny day bifacial power and the cloudiness factor are used in the secondary calculation. The bifacial relative gain is calculated in the tertiary calculation and the final system performance can be simulated. The sunny day bifacial power is calculated using solar geometry to determine the front and rear power output using terrestrial solar radiation based on the sun position and system location [3]. The model of diffused radiation and ground reflected radiation is based on the work published by G. M. Masters [4]. For the sunny day calculation, the cloudiness factor is not considered. The cloudiness factor is the GHI data at a given time as a percentage of the ideal GHI available on a clear day at the relevant point in time, which is calculated in the terrestrial solar calculations. For this work, the additional power from the rear side of the bifacial module is added to the power produced from the front side to provide the total module power. By assuming this, the series resistance effects and other potential effects cannot be considered.     There are three major parameters that are used in calculating the rear side illumination: (1) the diffused radiation incident at the rear of the module, (2) the diffuse and direct beam component incident on a horizontal plane, and (3) the length of the shadow cast behind the module, considering only the distance directly behind the module. In addition, the rear side illumination has a complex dependence on the height of the module above the ground, the tilt  430   Stanley Wang et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  428 – 433  of the module, and the position of the sun. The model considers three cases to account for these factors: (1) when the module is elevated infinitely high (far enough so that shading from the module on the ground is not a factor), (2)  when the module is on the ground, and (3) when the module is at intermediate heights. Figure 2 shows a module mounted at different heights (h 1  and h 2 ) in order to harvest more gain for the rear side, where  ��  is the module tilting angle,  �.1  and  �.2  are the elevation angles of the sun. Distances o 1 , o 2 , g 1  and d 1  are used in the bifacial relative gain calculation. The location determines system performance due to illumination, the percentage of diffuse radiation and the elevation of the sun. The system design changes performance through module height, module tilt, albedo and  local shading as these affect the amount of radiation incident on the rear of the module.     The actual bifacial percentage gain is the increased power output expected from a bifacial module compared to a monofacial module with the same system characteristics. This depends on both the cloudiness factor and the theoretical bifacial percentage gain on a clear day. From the cloudiness factor a performance scaling factor,  �G �Ö�ß�â�è�×, is determined to scale the theoretical bifacial percentage gain to obtain the actual bifacial percentage gain based on  statistical observations from measured data as lower irradiance days have a higher percentage of diffused radiation.      Fig. 2. The bifacial modelling schematic diagram shows a module with different mounting heights (h 1  and h 2 ). The amount of module mounting height is important for harvesting maximum power gain from the rear side. Sun’s array 1 and sun’s array 2 are from two different sun elevation angles. Symbol  ��  is the module tilting angle,  �.1  and  �.2  are the elevation angles of the sun. Distances o 1 , o 2 , g 1  and d 1  are used in the bifacial relative gain calculation.   3.   Simulation results The potential applications of the bifacial simulation model are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5. Germany and Singapore are chosen as the two different geographic locations representing countries with high and low latitude. The REC multicrystalline solar bifacial module used in the simulation work has 250W of power from  the front side and 150W from the rear side. The bifaciality is 0.6, the module length is 1.67m and the width is  0.99m. In this work, air mass 1.5 spectrum (AM1.5) and an intensity of 100mW/cm2 (one sun illumination) were used.      Stanley Wang et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  428 – 433 431  Fig.3. Module power comparison throughout a year at solar noon time in Konstanz, Germany. This is an example to illustrate the capability of the simulation. Different elevation heights were simulated and a 20% reflection coefficient was used for this simulation. The front module power is 250W and the rear module power is 150W. The module tilting angle is at 40 degrees. The model compares the module power delivered throughout a year in Konstanz, Germany in Figure 3. The latitude of Konstanz is 47.7 degrees north. The module tilting angle used was 40 degrees. By using the simulation model, the tilting angle can be optimized to give the maximum mono-facial power. Assuming the front module  power is always higher than the rear side for standard bifacial modules, the tilting angle should be set in a  favourable position to the front side. Early in the morning and later in the afternoon, the simulation model calculated low front side module power due to the low sun elevation angle. With 20% background reflectance with infinite elevation of the bifacial module, the energy yield gain from the rear of the module was calculated to be 10.4%; with a 1 meter of elevation, the gain is 9.1%. This indicated that with a 1 meter elevation, 90% of the potential energy yield can be potentially achieved. When there is no elevation at all, the upper limit for energy yield is still 4.6%. This further indicates that an adequate amount of elevation is required to harvest maximum. In addition, the model compares the module power delivered throughout a day in the month of July in Konstanz, Germany. Early in the morning and later in the afternoon, the simulation model calculated low module power due to low sun elevation angle. With infinite elevation, the energy yield gain from the rear of the module was calculated to be 10.4%, with 1m of elevation, the energy yield is 9.1%. This indicated that with 1m of elevation, ~90% of the potential energy yield can be achieved. When there is no elevation at all, the upper limit for energy yield is still 4.6%.       Fig.4. Module power comparison throughout a day in July in Konstanz, Germany. A 20% reflection coefficient for the ground under the module is used and the tilting angle is at 40 degrees.  432   Stanley Wang et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  428 – 433  In the next stage, the bifacial module performance at a country with low latitude is compared, and Singapore is used as an example as its latitude is 1.3   degree north. The model compares the module power delivered throughout a day on equinox. The module tilting angle used in the simulation is 10 degrees. From the simulation results, a similar  trend is found: early in the morning and late in the afternoon there is low module power due to the low sun elevation angle. When the module is sitting directly on the ground, the energy yield gain from the rear side of the bifacial  module is only 1.3%. With the case of infinite elevation, the energy yield is 10.4%. This value is in the same range as the studies done at the REC bifacial energy yield test site, where the data is collected for a duration of 2 months.  The tall elevation height is crucial for countries with low latitude.      Fig.5. Module power comparison throughout a day at equinox in Singapore. Different elevation heights were simulated and a 20% reflection coefficient was used for this simulation. The module tilting angle is at 10 degrees. From the Konstanz and Singapore simulation studies, we are able to conclude that the amount of module elevation depends on the location around the globe. For locations with high latitude, a lower amount of module elevation height would be sufficient compared to locations with low latitude. The altitude of the sun for Konstanz is lower than that of Singapore at any specific time throughout a day.     Fig.6. Module power comparison with varied module elevation height at Konstanz, Germany. For a bifacial module with varying elevation, it is important to understand that once the saturation point/height is reached, there is no further electrical performance benefit exceeding that saturation point. The saturation point is   Stanley Wang et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  428 – 433 433 reached when the shadow created by the module array is not covering any part of the ground area directly below the module. This also means that there is no shadowing effect directly below the module. Once the saturation point is reached, the scenario is similar to the case of infinite elevation height. From the model calculation, a 2.5 meters  module elevation height is required in Konstanz at solar noon time to reach the power saturation point, but only 0.5 meter is sufficient at local solar time 4pm in the afternoon to reach the power saturation point.  The rear side module power increases proportionally with increased background reflectivity. Background reflectivity is an important parameter for bifacial module setup & installation. Figure 7 shows energy yield increases with increased albedo from a fixed elevation height of 1 meter. The module tilting angle is 40 degrees and with 1 meter of elevation. The module power increased proportionally with increased background reflectivity. This shows background reflectivity is an important parameter for bifacial module setup & installation.     Fig.7. Module power comparison with different background reflectivity coefficient at Konstanz Germany. 4.   Conclusion Energy yield for bifacial modules is very much location dependent and hugely influenced by how they are setup and installed. In general, the bifacial modules work best in countries and regions at a higher latitude as the bifacial module performs better when the sun elevation angle is low. Besides, a ground surface with high reflectivity is desirable as it is one of the key parameters for bifacial module electrical performance. A background surface with a high reflection coefficient gives higher energy yield as this impacts the amount of reflected light. In addition,  sufficient clearance distance in front of the module array should be considered. To obtain a higher energy yield, ensure there is no blockage for the direct sun array shining on the area beneath the module. Simulation shoes >10% in energy yield is achievable with REC multicrystalline silicon solar modules with a bifaciality of 0.6. This is by  using realistic example of 20% background reflectance in Konstanz, Germany. References [1] A. Frey, J. Engelhardt, S. Fritz, S. Gloger, G. Hahn, B.

In  this  study,  we  investigated  and  characterized  one  recent  batch  of  TOPCon  cells  fabricated  on  156.75  � 156.75  � 0.18mm 3  wafers  with  fully  screen-printed  technology  by  an  industrial-type  process.  TOPCon  cells  with  an  effi - ciency  as  high  as  22.43%,  a  Voc  value  as  high  as  689.4  mV,  and  a  fill  factor  as  high  as  81.35%  were  obtained.  The  P  dopant  diffusion  in  the  poly  Si  layer  as  well  as  the  thickness  of  the  SiO x  layer  were  optimized  in  order  to  obtain  good  electrical  contact  between  screen-printed  Ag  and  Si.  The  thickness  of  the  SiO x  layer  should  be  over  1.5  nm,  which  is  beneficial  for  obtaining  a  good  passivation  for  the  cells.  The  surface  P  dopant  concentration  in  the  polycrystalline  Si  was  higher  than  1  � 10 20  atom/cm 3 ,  resulted  in  a  low  series  resistance  and  a  high  fill  factor.  The  characterization  and  simulation  results  show  that  both  metal  shading  loss  and  rear  surface  recombination  were  dominant  among  all  of  the  losses.  Application  to  solar  cells  with  a  Voc  of  697  mV  and  a  fill  factor  of  82.45%  could  lead  to  an  independently  confirmed  cell  efficiency  of  over  23%  for  n-type  cells  with  poly  Si  the  herein  developed  passivated  rear  contacts,  and  the  front  metal  contacts  by  addressing  the  issue  of  reducing  metal  recombination  and  implementing  a  selective  emitter.    1. Introduction  Currently,  passivated  emitter  and  rear  solar  cell  (PERC)  is  the  mainstream  production  with  a  median  efficiency  of  22%.  However,  it  is  hard  to  increase  cell  efficiency  by  the  present  technologies  and  pro - cesses.  There  are  two  key  factors  limiting  the  efficiency  of  crystalline  silicon  solar  cells.  One  is  recombination  at  the  metal  contacts  and  the  other  is  loss  caused  by  two-  or  three-dimensional  current  transport  paths.  In  order  to  overcome  the  two  issues,  a  tunnel  oxide  passivated  contact  (TOPCon)  cell  structure  has  been  proposed  and  developed,  which  could  achieve  an  ultra-high  efficiency  of  25.8%  without  an  interdigitated  back  contact  [ 1 ].  TOPCon  consists  of  an  ultra-thin  tunnel  oxide  and  a  P-doped  Si  layer  [ 2 – 4 ].  It  offers  a  simple  processing  scheme,  which  is  compatible  with  high-temperature  process,  such  as  diffusion.  For  this  solar  cell  structure,  a  rear-side  full-area  metal  contact  passivated  by  tunnel  oxide  provides  one-dimensional  current  transport  and  signif - icantly  reduces  metal  contact  recombination.  The  fabrication  of  TOPCon  requires  three-step  process.  Firstly,  the  growth  of  an  interfacial  oxide  layer,  then  the  deposition  of  an  amorphous  (or  polycrystalline)  Si-based  layer,  lastly  a  high-temperature  anneal  process.  The  purpose  of  the  interfacial  oxide  layer  is  to  reduce  dangling  bonds  and  thus  interface  trapped  charge  density  [ 5 – 9 ].

The  transport  mechanism  is  assumed  to  be  tunneling  or  transport  through  pinholes  which  easily  form  during  the  SiO x  fabrication  and/or  thermal  treatment.  The  appropriate  oxide ’ s  thickness  is  also  important  for  passivation.  A  thin  passivating  interlayer  is  introduced  between  the  high  recombination  regions  at  the  metal-semiconductor  interface  to  reduce  the  total  recombination/emitter  saturation  current  density  ( J 0 ),  result - ing  in  a  high  open-circuit  voltage  (Voc)  [ 10 – 13 ].  However,  the  inter - layer  must  passivate  the  Si  surface  without  interfering  with  the  majority  carrier  transport  to  ensure  a  good  fill  factor  (FF)  and  efficiency  (Eff).  For  example,  the  heterojunction  Si  cell  with  intrinsic  thin  amorphous  layer  (HIT)  could  produce  the  cell  Voc  of  750mV  with  Eff  over  25%  [ 10 , 11 ].  However,  this  passivation  scheme  could  not  withstand  temperature  above  250  o C  for  the  metallization  process.  To  obtain  highly  efficient  passivated  contacts  for  solar  cells,  three  prerequisites  have  to  be  met  [ 14 ]:  (i)  excellent  interface  passivation,  (ii)  efficiently  doped  layers  to  maintain  the  quasi-Fermi  level  separation  in  c-Si  (high  Voc),  and  (iii)  an  efficient  majority  carrier  transport  (high  FF).  In  this  study,  TOPCon  solar  cells  featuring  screen-printed  metal  contacts  on  both  sides  were  fabricated  from  156.75  � 156.75  � 0.18  mm 3  n-typeCz  Si  wafers  by  an  industrial-type  process.  The  tunnel  oxide  layers  with  three  different  thicknesses  were  obtained  by  annealing  process  at  temperature  550 – 650  o C.  The  influence  of  the  SiO x  layer  thickness  and  the  P  concentration  in  the  poly  Si  layer  on  the  efficiency,  Voc,  FF,  series  resistance  of  TOPCon  solar  cells  is  investigated.  The  in - crease  in  cell  efficiency  of  TOPCon  cells  in  mass  production  is  analyzed  and  discussed.  2. Experimental  2.1. TOPCon  cell  process  TOPCon  cells  with  round  chamfer  were  manufactured  from  commercially  available  156.75  � 156.75  mm 2  n-type  Cz  Si  wafers  with  resistivity  of  0.5 – 2    cm.  The  thickness  of  the  Si  wafers  was  180  � 10   m.  The  industrial-type  processes  of  TOPCon  solar  cells  were:  texture    BCl 3  diffusion    rear  side  etching    tunnel  oxide  layers    LPCVD    POCl 3  diffusion    BSG/PSG  removal    front  side  passivation  film    rear  side  passivation  film    screen  printing  and  firing.  All  wafers  were  textured  in  alkaline  solution  and  then  cleaned  with  a  mix  of  HCl  and  HF.  The  front  emitter  was  formed  in  a  quartz  tube  furnace  containing  BCl 3  gas.  Subsequently,  the  rear  side  was  etched  in  a  mix  of  HF  and  HNO 3 .  A  thin  interfacial  oxide  layer  was  grown  in  a  tube  furnace.  In  this  study,  there  are  three  different  thicknesses  of  the  SiO x  layers.  Table  1  shows  the  process  conditions  for  growing  SiO x  layer  with  different  thicknesses.  The  amorphous  Si  (a-Si)  layer  was  deposited  by  LPCVD  process  with  a  mean  layer  thickness  of  220  � 20  nm  on  both  sides.  The  thickness  of  the  SiO x  and  a-Si  layers  was  measured  by  spectroscopic  ellipsometry  using  soft - ware  SpectraRay/3  (SE800  PV).  A  high-temperature  annealing  and  P  diffusion  were  performed  at  850  o C  for  1  h  in  a  mix  of  POCl 3 ,  O 2  and  N 2 .  In  this  step  the  a-Si  is  converted  to  poly  Si  and  the  initial  surface  passivation  quality  is  enhanced  slightly.  In  next  cleaning  BSG/PSG  removal  step,  the  front  wrap  around  side  was  etched  using  5  wt%  tet - ramethylammonium  hydroxide  (TMAH)  solution  in  order  to  obtain  only  one  side  with  P-doped  poly-Si  layer.  Then,  the  front  and  rear  passiv - ations  of  the  cells  were  fabricated  by  ALD-4.7nm  thick  AlO x  and  PECVD-  80nm  thick  SiN x  dielectric  stacks,  respectively.  The  metallization  was  applied  by  screen  printing  and  firing  of  a  metal  paste  using  a  H-pattern  grid  design  on  both  sides  of  the  wafers.  The  metal  area  fraction  on  the  front  side  is  about  2.74%.  The  fast  firing  in  a  conveyer  belt  furnace  was  set  at  a  peak  temperature  of  865  o C.  Dupont  Ag – Al  paste  and  Dupont  Ag  paste  were  used  for  the  front  and  rear  sides,  respectively.  The  schematic  of  a  n-type  TOPCon  solar  cell  featuring  a  boron-diffused  emitter  and  a  passivating  rear  contact  is  displayed  in  Fig.  1 .  2.2. Characterization  The  current-voltage  (I – V)  parameters  and  curves  of  the  TOPCon  cell  were  measured  in-house  with  DENKEN  tester  after  calibration  using  a  standard  cell  by  Fraunhofer  ISE.  The  dopant  profiles  of  monitor  wafers  were  measured  by  ECV  device  (WEP  CVP21).  The  ECV-profiling  tech - nique  is  employed  to  measure  the  dopant  distribution  and  the  concen - tration  of  free  carriers.  The  implied  Voc  ( i Voc)  values  were  measured  on  control  wafers  by  WCT-120  Sinton  lifetime  tester  (Boulder,  CO,  USA)  [ 15 ].  The  saturation  current  density  J 0  of  the  poly  layers  was  tested  by  a  contactless  flash-based  photoconductance  decay  tester  (WCT-120  Sin - ton,  Boulder,  CO,  USA)  in  the  transient  mode  in  the  range  from  1  � 10 15  to  2  � 10 16  cm -3 ,  and  the  internal  quantum  efficiency  (IQE)  was  measured  by  PVE300-IVT.  The  contact  resistivity  ( R c )  of  screen-printed  metallization  on  solar  cells  featuring  tunnel  oxides  with  different  thicknesses  was  measured  by  transfer-length-method  (TLM,  GP-4  TEST).  Fig.  2  shows  the  principle  diagram  of  transfer-length-method.  The  resistance  that  was  measured  between  two  fingers  consists  of  diverse  parts  as  following  equation  (see  Fig.  2 a):   R measured  ¼ 2R tip  þ 2R c  þ d  � R sheet                                                   (1)  where  R sheet  is  the  sheet  resistance  of  poly  Si  layers,  R tip  is  identical  to  the  resistance  between  the  two  tips  on  the  same  finger  and  therefore  can  be  eliminated.  The  Eq.  (1)  can  be  reduced  as  following  equation  (2) :   R measured  ¼ 2R c  þ d  � R sheet                                                              (2)  In  the  SiO x /poly  Si  layer,  the  gap  model  was  obtained  using  laser  isolation  between  two  fingers,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2 b.  Then,  The  values  of  contact  resistivity  R c  could  be  calculated  by  several  measurements  in  order  to  remove  R sheet  value.  At  the  same  time,  the  contact  resistivity  can  estimate  the  quality  of  tunnel  oxide  layer.  In  each  batch,  a  set  of  Si  wafers  was  only  partially  processed  to  serve  as  monitor  wafers  for  saturation  current  density  J 0 .

The  texturing,  LPCVD,  P  diffusion  and  SiN x  processes  were  the  same  as  for  all  the  solar  cells  because  all  monitoring  wafers  were  processed  simultaneously  with  the  cells.  Fig.  3  shows  the  schematic  diagram  of  cross-sectional  moni - toring  wafers,  which  was  composed  of  thin  SiO x ,  n-type  polycrystalline  Si  and  SiN x  layers  on  both  sides  of  n-Si  wafers.  The  optical  reflection  of  the  solar  cells  was  measured  with  PVE300-  IVT  from  pv-tools.  Simultaneously,  an  optical  loss  analysis  by  above  results  was  carried  out  by  Current  Loss  Analysis  Calculator  V1.4  pro - vided  by  Solar  Energy  Research  Institute  of  Singapore.  The  silicon  wafers  with  as-fabricated  oxide  layers,  without  growth  of  amorphous  Si  and  P  doping  processes,  were  directly  annealed  at  850  o C  for  1h  under  a  nitrogen  atmosphere,  and  then  etched  with  15  wt%  TMAH  solution  at  80  o C  for  1min  and  2min,  in  order  to  observe  the  surface  quality  of  the  oxide  layer.  The  surface  morphology  of  the  as-  fabricated  and  as-annealed,  and  as-etched  oxide  layers  was  observed  at  five  locations  to  confirm  defects  distribution  by  an  optical  microscopy  (Olympus,  DSX100/DSX500/DSX500i).  3. Results  and  discussion  3.1. I – V  parameters  Table  2  shows  the  I – V  parameters  of  TOPCon  cells.  The  best  solar  cell  with  Eff  as  high  as  22.43%  and  a  Voc  value  as  high  as  689.4  mV  with  tunnel  oxide  prepared  at  550  o C  for  20  min  (condition  1,  1.55  nm  SiO x )  was  obtained.  The  difference  among  the  three  conditions  is  the  tem - perature  and  duration,  resulting  in  the  difference  in  the  thickness  of  the  tunnel  SiO x  layer  (see  Table  1 ).  Fig.  4  shows  the  plots  of  Voc,  short-  circuit  current  density  ( J sc ),  FF  and  Eff  values  of  TOPCon  cells  fabri - cated  by  three  different  conditions,  where  the  plot  heights  have  median  values.  The  same  low  Voc  value  of  about  680  mV  was  obtained  for  the  cells  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  thick  SiO x  layers.  The  lowest  FF  and  highest  series  resistance  were  obtained  for  cells  with  1.25  nm  thick  SiO x .  The  best  TOPCon  cells  with  the  highest  Voc,  J sc ,  FF  and  Eff  were  ob - tained  from  the  cells  with  1.55  nm  thick  SiO x  ( Fig.  4  and  Table  2 ).  During  annealing  at  800 – 900  o C  for  1h  in  an  oxygen-free  atmosphere,  the  following  reaction  takes  place:   SiO 2  þ Si    2SiO(g)                                                                        (3)  This  breakup  of  the  thin  oxide  layer  was  studied  in  detail  by  Wol - stenholme  et  al.  [ 16 ].  Here,  we  further  summarize  and  briefly  review  the  study  of  interfacial  oxide  layer  for  solar  cells  (See  Table  3 ).  After  reviewing  the  previous  publications,  the  mechanisms  governing  carrier  conduction  through  the  SiO x  layer  are  not  well  understood  and  based  on  the  thickness  of  the  SiO x  layer.  At  present,  there  are  two  categories  of  passivated  oxide  layers  [ 22 ].  One  is  SiO x  layer  thickness  < 1.6  nm,  the  conduction  mechanism  is  tunneling.  The  other  is  SiO x  layer  thickness  > 2nm,  the  conduction  mechanism  is  pinhole.  The  annealing  process,  such  as  temperature  and  duration  is  a  key  technique.  On  the  other  hand,  the  growth  processes  of  oxide  layer,  such  as  wet  chemically,  thermal  and  plasma-assisted  oxidation,  could  also  influence  the  quality  of  the  tunnel  oxide  layer.  Thermal  and  plasma-assisted  SiO x  provide  excellent  surface  chemical  passivation  because  they  are  dense,  have  stoichiometry  close  to  SiO 2 ,  and  have  few  bulk  defects.  However,  wet  chemically  grown  oxide  layers  are  less  dense  and  offstoichiometric,  and  could  result  in  inferior  passivation  and  blistering  [ 22 ].  For  oxide  layer  thickness  < 1.6nm,  the  oxide ’ s  integrity  weakens  at  high-temperature  annealing.  Some  phenomenon,  such  as  broken-up  and  balling-up,  is  present  [ 2 , 16 ].  Furthermore,  when  the  annealing  process  keep  stable,  the  thinner  oxide  layer  easily  tends  to  break  up  or  balling  up  [ 25 ].  The  effect  of  annealing  on  the  quality  of  three  different  oxide  layers  is  further  studied  and  dis - cussed  in  the  next  subsection.  In  case,  the  thickness  of  the  SiO x  layer  was  less  than  1.55  nm,  the  TOPCon  solar  cells  exhibited  poor  FF  with  a  high  R ser  because  the  tunneling  did  not  provide  a  sufficient  transport  channel  for  carrier  transport,  and  the  introduction  of  a  thin  layer  could  not  prevent  P  from  diffusing  into  Si  due  to  the  formation  of  some  defects  (such  as  pinhole  or  balling-up)  while  increasing  the  R ser  value  and  reducing  FF  value.

These  cells  have  the  same  pseudo  fill  factor  (pFF),  because  these  cells  were  from  the  same  wafers  and  were  manufactured  in  the  same  processes.  The  shunt  resistance  of  Si  wafer  based  solar  cells  with  three  conditions  keeps  the  same  value.  However,  the  R ser  value  of  the  wafer  with  1.55  nm  oxide  layer  is  smaller  than  the  ones  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  oxide  layers.  Therefore,  the  FF  loss  for  the  cells  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  oxide  layers  is  also  related  to  an  increase  in  series  resistance.  3.2. Cell  performance  Fig.  6  shows  the  plots  of  J 0  values  against  minority  carrier  density  from  1  � 10 15  to  2  � 10 16  cm -3  for  the  three  different  SiO x  tunnel  layers.  Because  there  are  not  good  fittings  at  some  injection  concentrations.  The  different  coloured  lines  in  the  figure  represents  the  different  injection  concentrations.  The  J 0  results  at  fit  range  of  3  � 10 15 – 5  � 10 15  cm -3  are  chosen  here.  In  this  study,  the  textured  poly  layers  were  passivated  by  SiN x  stacks.  The  passivation  quality  of  the  stacks  was  quantified  by  measuring  the  saturation  current  density  J 0 .  The  J 0  values  per  side  were  determined  from  the  slope  of  the  inverse  Auger-corrected  injection  level  dependent  effective  lifetime  at  high-injection  conditions.  In  Fig.  6 ,  there  was  the  lowest  J 0  of  about  18  fA/cm 2  for  the  wafers  with  1.55  nm  thick  SiO x  layer.  The  J 0  values  of  the  poly  layers  were  22  fA/cm 2  and  28  fA/  cm 2  for  the  wafers  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  thick  oxide  layers,  respectively.  The  average  i Voc  value  of  each  fabricated  cell  type  is  shown  in  Fig.  7 .  The  solar  cell  with  1.55  nm  SiO x  had  a  good  i Voc  value  of  700  mV.  However,  the  i Voc  values  of  the  cells  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  SiO x  were  less  than  that  of  the  cells  with  1.55  nm  oxide.  The  oxide  layer  with  a  thickness  of  1.55  nm  exhibited  the  best  passivation  effect.  Fig.  8  illustrates  the  contact  resistivity  for  cells  with  different  tunnel  oxide  thicknesses  after  firing  at  865  o C.  The  plot  indicates  the  confidence  interval  of  the  median  of  the  contact  resistivity.  The  cells  with  1.55  nm  thick  tunneling  layer  had  a  low  contact  resistivity  of  0.67  m   cm 2  because  of  higher  surface  doping  concentration.  The  cells  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  oxide  layers  had  high  contact  resistivity  of  > 1.5  m   cm 2 .  This  result  explains  why  the  cells  from  conditions  2  and  3  feature  higher  R ser  compared  to  condition  1  (see  Table  2 ).  The  reason  for  reduced  R c  may  be  an  enhanced  drive-in  of  dopants.  However,  this  adversely  affects  the  recombination  current  at  non-metallized  sites  [ 29 ].  Therefore,  we  should  find  out  a  balancing  point  between  R c  and  J 0 .  In  this  study,  the  cells  with  1.55  nm  oxide  layer  have  low  J 0  of  18  fA/cm 2  and  R c  of  0.67  m   cm 2 ,  which  is  attributed  to  controlling  the  thickness  of  the  SiO x  layer  and  P  doping  concentration  on  the  surface.  In  this  study,  the  cells  fabricated  with  different  tunneling  SiO x  thicknesses  had  the  same  diffusion  in  the  poly  Si  layers.  The  only  dif - ference  was  the  thickness  of  oxide  layer.  Fig.  9  presents  the  ECV  profiles.  The  cells  from  three  different  conditions  have  different  P  dopant  pro - files.  The  depths  of  the  poly  diffused  regions,  defined  here  as  the  depth  where  carrier  concentration  equals  the  bulk  doping,  were  0.3   m.  The  surface  concentration  of  the  three  carrier  concentration  profiles  is  higher  than  1  � 10 20  atom/cm 2 .  The  monitor  wafers  with  1.55  nm  SiO x  feature  a  higher  surface  concentration  than  the  ones  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  SiO x .  Because  the  thin  oxide  layer  with  thickness  of  less  than  1.5  nm  could  not  prevent  P  from  diffusing  into  Si,  which  had  a  smooth  Fig.  4.

Wang  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    tail  ECV  profile.  On  the  other  hand,  the  quality  of  the  tunneling  oxide  layer,  such  as  the  size  and  number  of  pinholes  in  the  layer  could  also  influence  P  diffusion.  This  result  would  be  confirmed  by  the  further  experiment.  The  solar  cells  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  oxide  layers  have  a  low  surface  concentration  and  are  poorly  passivated.  In  this  work,  the  quality  of  the  oxide  layer  has  been  further  studied.

Q.  Wang  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    properties  of  tunnel  oxide  and  the  interface-state  density  at  the  interface  between  the  SiO x  and  c-Si  [ 27 , 28 ].  Fig.  10  shows  the  optical  microscopy  images  of  polished  silicon  wafers  with  three  different  thick  oxide  layers  before  and  after  etched  in  15  wt%  TMAH  solution  at  80  o C  for  1  min  and  2  min.  The  surface  of  as-deposited  and  as-annealed  oxide  layers  is  continuous,  and  no  defects  appear.  The  high  temperature  annealing  process  is  the  same  with  high-temperature  annealing  process  for  the  crystallization  and  dopant  activation  at  850  o C  for  1h.  However,  there  is  no  both  amorphous  Si  and  P  doped  processes,  the  as-annealed  oxide  layers  were  etched  with  15  wt%  TMAH  solution  at  80  o C  for  1  min  and  2  min.  After  a  short  etching  time,  the  surface  of  the  as-annealed  oxide  layer  is  still  continuous  and  dense.  However,  after  2  min  etching  time,  the  surface  of  thin  oxide  layers  with  1.25  nm  thickness  presents  some  defects  (dotted  circle  line),  such  as  etch  pits.  We  could  observe  some  etch  pits  were  present  at  five  different  locations.  At  the  same  time,  the  surface  of  1.43  nm  thick  oxide  layer  also  has  two  etch  pits,  indicating  the  defect  density  in  the  1.43  nm  thick  oxide  layer  is  less  than  the  one  in  the  1.25  nm  thick  oxide  layer.  The  resulting  etch  pits  in  the  underlying  silicon  are  much  larger  than  the  original  pinholes.  Therefore,  these  etch  pits  can  readily  be  detected.  It  could  be  inferred  from  these  observed  defects  that  the  TOPCon  solar  cells  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  oxide  layer  has  poor  FF  and  high  R ser  due  to  passivation  loss,  resulting  from  the  quality  of  thin  oxide  layer  after  high-temperature  annealing  process.  The  1.55  nm  thick  oxide  layer  shows  perfect  surface  after  etched  by  TMAH  solution,  indicating  the  1.55  nm  thick  oxide  layer  is  dense  and  continuous.  However,  the  reason  for  the  formation  of  defects  in  1.25  nm  thin  oxide  layer  might  be  attributed  to  the  passivation  loss  at  locally  thin  SiO x  regions  after  high-temperature  annealing  process.  This  result  is  in  agreement  with  the  Ref.  [ 25 ].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  optimize  the  annealing  temperature  or  duration  for  the  thin  SiO x  layer.  Zeng  et  al.  [ 30 ]  also  pointed  out  that  it  is  possible  to  control  the  density  of  pinholes  through  a  well-controlled  anneal  process.  At  the  same  time,  the  series  resistance  of  the  wafer  with  thin  SiO x  layer  is  larger  than  the  one  of  the  wafer  with  thick  SiO x  layer,  due  to  the  existence  of  locally  very  thin  SiO x  regions  in  the  thin  SiO x  layer.  Furthermore,  according  to  ECV  profiles,  the  P  concentration  at  the  interfacial  oxide  layer  for  thin  SiO x  layer  is  higher  than  that  for  1.55  nm  thick  SiO x  layer.  The  increase  in  contact  resistivity  value  in  fact  matches  the  amount  of  series  resistance  increased  and  FF  loss  of  the  cell  (see  Figs.  5  and  8 ).  These  experimental  results  confirm  that  the  quality  of  1.25  nm  thin  SiO x  layer  is  not  good,  possibly  incompletely  continuous  layer  or  less  stoichiometric  oxide.  In  this  study,  the  low-temperature  thermal  SiO x  layers  were  obtained  at  550 – 650  � C  for  different  durations.  Therefore,  the  growth  conditions  of  oxides  might  result  in  the  difference  in  the  quality  of  tunnel  oxides.  The  thin  oxide  layer  at  locally  thin  layer  regions  or  less  stoichiometric  oxide  layer  is  more  prone  to  disruption  at  high-temperature  anneal,  which  could  result  in  the  formation  of  defects  (etch  pits).  The  uniformity  and  continuity  of  1.55  nm  thick  SiO x  layer  is  better  than  the  ones  of  the  Fig.  5. I – V  curves  for  the  cells  fabricated  under  three  different  tunneling  SiO x  thicknesses.  Fig.  6. Plots  of  J 0  values  as  a  function  of  minority  carrier  density  from  1  � 10 15  to  2  � 10 16  cm -3 for  (a)  1.55  nm  SiO x  layer,  (b)  1.25  nm  SiO x  layer,  (c)  1.43  nm  SiO x  layer.  Q.  Wang  et  al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    others.  Therefore,  the  dominant  carrier  transport  mechanism  in  the  1.55  nm,  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  thick  SiO x  contacts  is  through  tunneling.  The  simulated  optical  reflection  matches  fairly  well  without  any  adjustments  to  a  characteristic  experimental  reflection,  as  shown  in  Fig.  11 .  The  experimental  reflection  was  slightly  lower  than  the  simu - lated  reflection,  as  the  busbar  shading  was  not  included  in  the  mea - surement.  A  loss  analysis  in  terms  of  current  density  was  derived  from  the  simulation,  as  shown  on  the  right  hand  side  of  Fig.  11 .  Besides  the  metal  shading  losses,  losses  resulted  mainly  from  ARC  reflectance  and  NIR  parasitic  absorption  losses,  which  partly  included  the  light  trapping  capability  of  the  TOPCon  cells.  The  light  trapping  capability  may  be  evaluated  looking  at  the  Yablonovitch  limit  (ideal  light  trapping)  of  46.43  mA/cm 2  [ 31 ].  The  metal  shading  loss  was  due  to  the  front  metal  grid.  In  this  study,  the  metal  area  fraction  on  the  front  side  is  about  2.74%  for  H  pattern  grid  on  both  front  and  back.  Therefore,  thinning  fingers  could  reduce  metal  area  fraction  and  then  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  solar  cells.  While  a  reduced  front  metallization  fraction  could  reduce  shading  loss,  hence  higher  series  resistance  and  lower  FF  values  would  be  obtained.  Optimization  of  the  front  side  metallization  should  take  all  these  factors  into  account.  The  reflectance  loss  at  the  cell  front  side  may  be  reduced  by  tuning  the  ARC  optical  properties,  such  as  refraction  index  and  thickness,  as  well  as  by  improved  front  surface  texturing  for  better  light-trapping.  An  optical  loss  was  due  to  < 100%  cell  rear  surface  internal  reflectance,  and  to  a  certain  extend  due  to  free  carrier  absorption.  The  optical  loss  could  be  decreased  by  improving  the  rear  internal  reflector,  e.g.  good  rear  planarization  and  tuning  its  optical  property.  A  recombination  related  current  loss  was  due  to  finite  diffu - sion  length  in  the  wafer  and  rear  surface  recombination.  The  diffusion  depth  may  be  increased  by  good  wafer  material  quality  and  bulk  passivation  of  electrically  active  defects  in  case  of  multi-crystalline  Si.  The  IR  light  that  escapes  from  the  cells  can  be  reduced  by  improving  the  light  trapping.  The  optimization  of  thickness  of  the  SiO x  tunnel  layer,  and  annealed  temperature  could  improve  the  efficiency  of  solar  cells,  at  the  same  time  the  metal  paste  for  rear  poly,  sintering  and  boron  diffusion  processes,  and  thinning  fingers  also  further  need  to  be  optimized,  in  order  to  in - crease  the  efficiency  of  solar  cells.  After  optimization  of  several  pro - cesses,  industrial-type  TOPCon  cells  at  the  present  pilot  line  with  an  efficiency  as  high  as  23.03%,  a  Voc  value  as  high  as  697  mV,  and  a  fill  factor  as  high  as  82.45%  has  been  obtained.  4. Conclusions  A  tunnel  oxide  passivated  contact  for  the  rear  side  base  contact  of  n-  type  silicon  solar  cells  has  been  studied.  It  has  been  shown  that  the  TOPCon  structure  based  on  a  tunnel  oxide  and  P-doped  Si  layer  pas - sivates  the  surface  effectively.  A  1.55  nm  thick  SiO x  layer  provides  a  J 0  value  as  low  as  18fA/cm 2 .The  solar  cells  with  the  TOPCon  structure  have  shown  a  good  performance  with  Voc  as  low  as  687  mV  and  FF  as  high  as  81.09%.  After  as-annealed  oxide  layers  were  etched  with  15  wt%  TMAH  so - lution  at  80  o C  for  2  min,  the  surface  of  thin  oxide  layers  with  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  thickness  presents  etch  pits.  The  1.55  nm  thick  oxide  layer  is  dense  and  continuous.  The  dominant  carrier  transport  mechanism  in  the  1.55  nm,  1.25  nm  and  1.43  nm  thick  SiO x  layers  is  through  tunneling.  The  best  TOPCon  cell  has  an  independently  confirmed  efficiency  as  high  as  22.43%.  It  has  also  been  demonstrated  that  the  efficiency  is  limited  by  recombination  at  the  rear.  Hence,  by  improving  poly  Si  quality  and  the  front  metal  contacts  by  addressing  the  issue  of  reducing  metal  recombination  and  implementing  a  selective  emitter.  A  further  increase  of  the  efficiency  well  above  24%  seems  to  be  possible.  Author  contributions  WPW  and  QQW  contributed  equally  to  this  work.  Profs.  YLL  and  NYY  Fig.  7.

This work investigates the emitter dark satu - ration current density under the passivation layer (J 0e, passivated ), the metallization-induced recombination cur - rent density under the metal contact (J 0e, metal ), and the I–V parameters, including short-circuit current density (J sc ), open circuit voltage (V oc ), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (E ff ) as functions of the peak concentration (N max ) and junction depth of B-doped profile. We introduced the profile with the peak concentration of 1–1.5 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3  and a junction depth of 0.75–1.0   m to improve the conversion efficiency of 23.4%. The results revealed that J sc,  implied V oc  (iV oc ) and the contact resistance (  c ) were negative correlated with the N max  and junction depth. However, J 0e, passivated  had a positive correlation with the same. The results from   c , J 0e  along with the I–V showed the junction depth of emitter doping profiles need to exceed the corroded depth of Ag/Al paste to get a low   c , meanwhile, a low J 0e  should be ensured. The results suggested theB-selective emitters were developed with a low   c  and a low J 0e . After optimizing B-selective emitters and passivation processes, we ob - tained industry-grade TOPCon cells with E ff , V oc , J sc , and FF as high as 23.7%, 709 mV, 40.8 mA/cm 2 , and 82%, respectively. This optimized B-doped and simplified B-selective emitters processes can be commercially applied in photovoltaics.    1.Introduction Phosphorus (P)-doped electron-selective contact (n-TOPCon) (Feld - mann et al., 2013, 2014) solar cells are being studied extensively and large-scale commercialization of this technology appears promising. n + - poly-Si is fabricated through the following process (Polzin et al., 2018): (i) Growth of an interfacial oxide layer; (ii) Deposition of a doped amorphous Si layer (or a-Si layer); (iii) Recrystallization of the doped a- Si layer. Previous studies have reported the emitter recombination current of n + -poly-Si had a low density of approximately ~ 1.4 fA/cm 2  under the passivation layer (J 0e, passivated ) on the polished surface (Tet - zlaff et al., 2017), and its metallization-induced recombination current densities (J oe, metal ) under the rear-contact was very low ~ 35 fA/cm 2  (Padhamnath et al., 2019), respectively. Meanwhile, high efficiencies of more than 26% were achieved via a tunnel-oxide passivation contact on an area of 4 cm 2  for n- and p-type substrates with either “front- and back- contacted” or “interdigitated back contact” architectures (Richter et al., 2018, 2020; Haase et al., 2018). Recently, for the front-side heavily B- doped p +layer, B-doping recombination lower than 11 fA/cm 2  @ 150 O/sqr has been reported on n-PERT solar cell (Ajay et al., 2020), how - ever, its saturation current density at the Ag–Al contact increased to several 1,000 fA/cm 2  before optimization (Kiefer et al., 2014; Heinz et al., 2014; Lohmüller et al., 2014b; Edler et al., 2015; W¨ohrle et al., 2016). And now, Lin et al. reported that its saturation current density can be<600fA/cm 2  (Lin et al., 2020). Meanwhile, Zhu et al. showed that its saturation current density at the Al instead of Ag-Al contact decreased  *Corresponding authors at: Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Photovoltaic Science and Engineering, Changzhou University, Changzhou 213164, PR China.

Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    to 348 fA/cm 2  (Zhu et al., 2021). But, the B-doped recombination is high enough compared with n + -poly-Si recombination. Therefore, the losses of n + -poly-Si recombination could be negligible in n-TOPCon solar cells. Meanwhile, for mass-produced Si solar cells with industrial tunnel- oxide passivated contacts (i-TOPCon), lots of the largest PV manufac - turers including CanadianSolar, GCL, JinkoSolar, Jolywood, SunPower, TrinaSolar, and Yingli have publicly reported the research on i-TOPCon (Hermle et al., 2020; Schultz-Wittmann et al., 2016; PV-magazine, 2020; Chen et al., 2019, 2020). Especially, the pilot lines efficiencies of Jin - koSolar and TrinaSolar were reported above 24.5% (PV-magazine. 2020; Chen et al., 2020). Therefore, a big challenge about the further improvement of the conversion efficiency is the recombination and electrical contacting of B-doped emitters in n-TOPCon solar cells. The preparation processes of B-doped emitter include BBr 3  tube diffusion (Padhamnath et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2019), B diffusion using boric acid (Ebrahimi et al., 2017), or B-ion implantation (Ok et al., 2016) and so on. However, the same requirements for B-doped emitters are to obtain a low emitter dark saturation current density (J 0e, passivated ), resulting in obtaining a high open-circuit voltage (V oc ). For achieving this, the front-side heavily B-doped p + layer should be lightly doped with a low peak concentration and a shallow junction. Meanwhile, a low specific contact resistance (  c ) must be ensured for screen-printed metallization along with the high surface concentration of B-doped p + layer (Lohmüller et al., 2015; Werner et al., 2016). However, for achieving a low specific contact resistance of a few mcm 2  with screen- printed technology, a small amount of Al must be added to the Ag paste (Kopecek et al., 2005; Lago et al., 2010; Kerp et al., 2006). However, the screen-printed Ag/Al pastes initiate a stronger saturation current density at the metal contact, leading to severe losses of open-circuit voltage (Kiefer et al., 2014; Heinz et al., 2014; Edler et al., 2014; W¨ohrle et al., 2016; Fritz et al., 2015; Koduvelikulathu et al., 2015; Kiefer et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018) due to the large metal crystallites formed at the interface between the Ag–Al bulk contact and the surface of the Ag–Al contacts (Heinz et al., 2014; Lohmüller et al., 2014a, 2014b; Edler et al., 2014; W¨ohrle et al., 2016; Kopecek et al., 2005; Lago et al., 2010; Fritz et al., 2016a). This ultimately results in the loss of conversion efficiency. A deep junction doping profile will be required to reduce the metallization-induced recombination losses (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, another major challenge to improve the efficiency is to achieve a high surface doping concentration with a low contact resistance to screen- printed Ag/Al metallization while maintaining highly homogenous emitter sheet resistance to minimize the emitter saturation current density (Schiele et al., 2014). Here, we further summarize and briefly review the study of B emit - ters for solar cells (See Table 1). After reviewing the previous publica - tions, the effect of B-doped profiles on the n-TOPCon solar cells, especially I–V parameters, has not yet been understood to a significant level. Therefore, this study focuses on the front-side B-doped profiles of n-Topcon solar cells, which consists of screen-printed metallic contacts on both sides fabricated from 158.75 mm ×158.75 mm ×0.17 mm Cz–Si wafers through an industrial-type process with the fixed Ag–Al/Ag pastes. To this end, the peak concentration/junction depth of the B- doped profile was experimentally investigated with respect to their in - fluences on J 0e, passivated ,   c , J 0e,metal , and the I–V parameters of solar cells, i.e., efficiency (E ff ), open-circuit voltage (V oc ), fill factor (FF), se - ries resistance (R ser ) and short-circuit current density (J sc ). 2.Experimental methods 2.1.Solar cell fabrication We fabricated five types of samples: (a) the measurement of elec - trochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) sample with a symmetric double- sided B-doped layer on 0.8–1 	 . cm n-type Cz-Si wafers; (b) the p + np + sample with a symmetric double-sided B-diffused and passivation with ALD–AlO x /PECVD SiN x  stacks in order to extract the passivation layer (J 0e, passivated ) on 5 	 . cm n-type Cz-Si wafers; (c) the metallization- induced recombination (J 0e, metal ) sample with metal contacts printed on one side of the p + np + sample on 5 	 . cm n-type Cz-Si wafers; (d) the measurement of specific contact resistance (  c ) sample with H patterns (9 busbar �110 fingers) on one side of the p + np + sample on 0.8–1 	 . cm n-type Cz-Si wafers; (e) the structure of n-TOPCon cells (Fig. 1).

We manufactured the n-TOPCon cells from commercially available 158.75 mm ×158.75 mm n-type Cz–Si wafers with 0.8–1 	cm elec - trical resistivity. The Si wafer thickness was 160 ±10   m. The cell fabrication sequence has been introduced in a previous work (Wang et al., 2020a, 2020b). All wafers were textured in alkaline (KOH) solu - tion and subsequently cleaned in a mixture solution of HCl and HF. The front B emitter was formed in a quartz tube furnace containing BCl 3  gas using LYDOP™ system technology (SEMCO) (Oliver et al., 2010; Armand et al., 2011). The ECV samples on 0.8–1 	cm n-type Cz–Si wafers were obtained by HF (15%) cleaning the diffused sample to remove the borosilicate glass (BSG) layer (Peiner et al., 1995; Bock et al., 2008). The deposition time, drive-in, oxidation time and oxidation temperature of the BCl 3  diffusion processes (See Table 2) were adapted such that the B-doped profiles featured nearly identical curve progressions up to a depth of d ≈100 nm. The depletion of the B concentration close to the surface results from the post-oxidation step performed at the end of the BCl 3  diffusion processes, because the solubility of B is higher in silicon oxide than in silicon (Grove et al., 1964). Different junction depths are determined at a dopant concentration of N =10 16  atoms/cm 3 . In this study, we con - ducted two types of experiments, whose specifications are as shown in Table 1. In the first type, we varied the peak concentration under a constant junction depth: 1) emitter type D1 [d 1  ≈0.5   m (N max  ≈1.15 / 2.23 / 2.89 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 )], 2) emitter type D2 [d 2  ≈0.63   m (N max  =1.22 / 1.49 / 4 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 )], 3) emitter type D3 [d 3  ≈0.8   m (N max  ≈1.94 / 2.63 / 3.14 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 )] (Fig. 2a/b/c).

Q. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    second type, the junction depth was varied under the same peak con - centration: 1) emitter type N1 [N 1  ß3 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3  (0.5/0.8/1.0   m)] and 2) emitter type N2 (N 2  ß2.6 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3  (0.5/0.85   m)] (Fig. 2d/e). ALD-AlO x /PECVD-SiN x  stacks were deposited on both sides of the p � np � structure samples and the test structure samples on 5 	cm n-type Cz–Si wafers. While AlO x  had a thickness of 3 nm, SiN x  had a thickness of 80 nm. The same types of samples with pyramid-textured surfaces as in the p � np � structure samples were screen-printed with Ag/Al contact lines only on one side, with four different pitches as the test structure. Then, the Ag/Al paste was exposed to fire in an industrial belt-firing furnace at a peak firing temperature of 750  ffi C with the finger-side facing up. Subsequently, the fingers were etched off with aqua regia (V HCl :V HNO3  �3:1). Finally, the samples were rinsed in deionized (DI) water and oven dried. The J 0e  values for the four metallization fractions f were calculated using the same Sinton WCT-120 tool as for the earlier J 0e  measurements. Meantime, the specific contact resistance (  c ) sample was achieved from printed H patterns (9 busbar �110 fingers) on one side of the p � np � sample on 0.8–1 	cm n-type Cz–Si wafers. The rear side after B diffusion was etched using a mixed solution of HF/HNO 3 . The rear side of the SiO x  (1.2–2 nm) / a-Si (150 Σ20 nm) layers were deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Subsequently, the as-prepared samples were annealed in a tube furnace at 900  ffi C for 45 min in a mix of POCl 3 , O 2 , and N 2  to crystallize the a-Si to poly-Si. In the next cleaning BSG/ phosphorsilicate glass (PSG) removal step, the poly-Si wraparound side was etched in inline treatment with HF/HNO 3  and batch-type treatment with KOH/ polish additives solution, to have only one side with n � -poly-Si layer (Wang et al., 2020b). Then, the front and rear passivation of the cell was fabricated by 3 nm-AlO x /80 nm-SiN x  and 80 nm-SiN x , respectively. The wafer was metallized by screen-printed and firing of a metal paste using an H-patterned grid design on both sides. A commercial Ag/Al paste and Ag paste were used for the front-side metal grid and the rear, respec - tively. The 9-busbar (BB) configuration was used for both the front and rear sides. Then, the cells were manufactured by fast firing the wafer in a conveyor belt furnace at a peak firing temperature of 750  ffi C. 2.2.Characterization The current–voltage (I–V) parameters were measured using a DENKEN tester after calibration by a Fraunhofer ISE standard cell. The implied V oc  (iV oc ) values of the controlled samples were determinedby a lifetime tester under 1-sun illumination (WCT-120 Sinton, Boulder, CO, USA). The J 0e, passivated  and J 0e,metal  values of the samples were measured by WCT-120 Sinton and extracted at the excess carrier density of 3 Θ10 15  cm �3  (Liu et al., 2016) (Boulder, CO, USA). The B-doped profiles of monitor wafers were measured by ECV device (WEP CVP21) using a 0.1 M NH 4 F solution as the etchant. The microstructure and morphology of the previously metallized areas after removing the metal paste, the glass layer, and the dielectric passivation layer stack by a wet-chemical etching process were measured by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, Quanta FEG 250, FEI). The specific contact resistance (  c ) of the screen-printed metallized contact with different profiles was determined by the transfer-length-method (TLM) (GP-4 TEST). The optical reflec - tance of the cell was measured by PVE300-IVT. During these tests, the optical losses were analyzed by Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 (the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore) (Wong et al., 2016). 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Emitter dark saturation current density of the B-diffused/AlO x /SiN x  structure It is important to estimate the surface passivation performance of the B-doped front surface of the cells because the passivated region occupies greater than 95% front surface. Therefore, effective passivation of the B- doped surface is integral to design high-efficiency n-TOPCon solar cell. More importantly, it is essential to understand the change in the passivation quality with the B-doped profile. In this subsection, we explain that in order to evaluate the emitter passivation quality in the passivated p � layers, the symmetrical samples were B-diffused and passivated by AlO X /SiN x  films (Fig. 1b). The values of J 0e, passivated  with different peak concentrations and junction depths were determined from quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurements and Kane and Swanson’s proposal (Kane and Swanson, 1985) on testing 3–4 wafers at 3 points per piece (Fig. 3). In the case of emitter D1, J 0e, passivated  can be increased from 18.4 to 22.3 fA/cm 2  by increasing the peak concentra - tion from 1.15 to 2.89 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3  at d 1  �0.5   m (Fig. 3a). A low surface dopant concentration leads to a low interface state density, which further leads to a low surface recombination velocity (Altermatt et al., 2002). The same trend can be observed for emitters D2 (d 2  �0.63   m) and D3 (d 3  �0.8   m) (Fig. 3b�·c). For the emitter D2, J 0e, passivated  increased from 15.7 to 44.4 fA/cm 2  by increasing the peak concentra - tion from 1.22 to 4 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3  at d 1  �0.63   m (Fig. 3b). For the emitter D3, J 0e, passivated  increased from 23.3 to 39.9 fA/cm 2  by increasing the peak concentration from 1.94 to 3.14 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3  at d 1  �0.8   m (Fig. 3c). However, we found that the peak concentration on the deep junctions (emitters D2 �·�×D3) has a stronger impact on the value of J 0e, passivated  than that on the shallow junction (emitters D1). Perhaps because the deep junctions have high bulk recombination, and then they are sensitive to surface concentration. As shown in Fig. 3c, the value of J 0e, passivated  increased from 22.3 to 42.8 fA/cm 2  with the in - crease in the junction depth from 0.5 to 1.0   m on the peak concen - tration of 3 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3 . And in Fig. 3d, J0e , passivated  increased from 22.4 to 36.4 fA/cm 2  by increasing the junction depth from 0.5 to 0.85   m at the peak concentration of 2.6 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3 .

Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    the junction depth and the peak concentration increased, the value of J 0e, passivated  changed in the same direction because of the large surface and bulk recombination, which has a higher doping density due to lowered minority mobility. To reduce J 0e, passivated , the B-doped profiles should have a low dopant concentration and a shallow junction. A firing-through Ag/Al paste was used to metallize the passivated p + layers. Because the paste may deteriorate the passivation ability of the stack, the samples with four different metallization fractions were screen-printed, as described in Subsection 2.1. Fig. 4a illustrates the photograph of screen-printing pattern of the sample with different metallization fractions and Fig. 4b shows the photoluminescence (PL) image of a sample after firing and removing the Ag/Al contact lines. References (Fellmeth et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2020) presented the for - mula of J 0e, metal  based on a simple linear interpolation of the measured data points (Fig. S1). In this study, J 0e, metal  was extracted from the Sinton tests of the samples (three pieces of solar cells were fabricated for metal coverage per boron profile) (Fig. S2). Profiles with a higher peak concentration on a constant junction depth(D1/D2/D3) (Fig. 5a-c) exhibit a significantly lower J 0e, metal , i.e., it decreases from 828 fA/cm 2  (1.15 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) to 645 fA/cm 2  (2.89 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ), and from 711.2 fA/cm 2  (1.22 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) to 342.4 fA/cm 2  (4 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ), and from 550 fA/cm 2  (1.94 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) to 412 fA/ cm 2  (3.14 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ), respectively. These results can be explained by the “transport limited emitters” concept (del Alamo and Swanson,1984), which are less sensitive to bulk recombination because the hole concentration in the most highly doped layers of the emitters, near the surface where the lifetime is very degraded and become short. Therefore, the hole recombination rate is small too. The effect of increasing the doping level is to reduce J o . According to these results, the peak concentration had a more remarkable effect in shallow emitter D1/ D2 than deep emitter D3 within the investigated range. For the same peak concentration, J 0e, metal  exhibits a simple linear interpolation with junction depth (¡0.85   m), as shown in Fig. 5d�·e. This relationship can be also explained by the “transport limited emit - ters” concept of del Alamo et al.’s theory (del Alamo and Swan - son,1984), which can increase the doping thickness and then reduce J o  value .  However, the J 0e, metal  of the sample with the deep junction of 1.0   m increases up to 699.3 fA/cm 2  (Fig. 5d), possibly due to not only the penetration of the metal into the emitter region but also the increase in junction depth with the high bulk recombination. As illustrated in Fig. 5f, the measured J 0e, metal  was analyzed by the junction depth and the peak concentration. Under fixed metallization conditions, the degree of the metallization-induced recombination losses was significantly dependent on the doping profile. To obtain a good J 0e, metal , a higher peak concentration and appropriate junction is required, rather than the deepest junction. 3.2.Microstructure at metal–Si interface Fig. 6a presents the typical top-view SEM micrograph of emitter D3 (1.94 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) etched in aqua regia. The corroded pyramid structure was present on the surface of the cell, which had a width of more than 1.2   m. The Ag/Al paste does not uniformly corrode the B- doped layer. In Fig. 6b, the corroded depth is approximately 0.45–0.63   m—clearly 5 times larger than the depletion zone depth. The effect of the depletion zone on the   c  could be negligible (Lohmüller et al., 2015). In Fig. 6c, the width of the corrosion hole is approximately 0.38   m within the investigated range. According to W⁀ohrle et al. (W⁀ohrle et al., 2016), the heavy increase in J 0e, metal  started until the tips reached depths where the B-doped concentration was lower than approximately 10 18  atoms/cm 3  for all profiles. Therefore, we inferred that J 0e, metal  is not significantly affected at depths of greater than 0.63   m when a dopant concentration was equal to 10 18  atoms/cm 3 . This is because the effect of the peak concentration on J 0e, metal  in shallow emitter D1 and D2 is more significant than that in deep emitter D3. The sample with the junction depth of 1.0   m had a higher J oe, metal  because the deeper emitter had a high bulk recombination (Edler et al., 2014). 3.3.Contact resistance The specific contact resistance   c  for the tested structure with the sample is shown in Fig. 7. Lohmüller et al. (Lohmüller et al., 2015) re - ported that the macroscopically measured specific contact resistance   c  can be explained, assuming that current is transported exclusively via crystallites in direct contact with the Ag–Al contact bulk and the B- doped emitter when the dopant concentration is less than 8 ×10 19  cm �3 . The confidence interval for the median of the specific contact resistance values was illustrated by the notched box plot. In the case of varying emitters (D1–D3), the specific contact resistance can be decreased significantly from 4.5 to 1.1 mcm 2  by increasing the peak concen - tration, as shown in Fig. 7a-c. Meantime, the specific contact resistance can be decreased significantly from 3.1 to 1.1 mcm 2  by increasing the junction depth from 0.5 to 0.85   m for the same peak concentration (emitters N1�·N2, Fig. 7d-e) and approached a flat after the junction depth reached 1.0   m. To analyze the influence of the process param - eters on the specific contact resistance, the   c  values of the B-doped  Fig. 4.The photograph of the screen-printing pattern of the sample with different metallization fraction from 2% to 8% (a) and Photoluminescence (PL) image (b) of the symmetrical samples were boron-diffused and passivated by Al 2 O 3 /SiN x  films with four different metallization fractions on the front side. The metal was etched away before the PL measurement. The numbers in percentage indicate the metallization fractions.  Q.

The figure reveals a linear relationship between   c  and the peak concentration/depth junction (Dur�an et al., 1991; Fritza et al., 2013). To obtain a suitable   c , a high peak concentration and deep junction of B- doped profiles were required because a high dosage of B doping can improve the electrical conductivity. 3.4.Precursor iV oc  Fig. 8 shows the iV oc  and effective lifetime of the precursor structure wafers without metallization measured by the quasi-steady-state pho - toconductance technique (QSSPC) (Sinton et al., 1996).

The profiles with a high peak concentration on a constant junction depth D1, D2, D3 (Fig. 8a-c) exhibited a significantly low iV oc , i.e., it decreased from 721 (1.15 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) to 712 mV (2.89 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) on emitter D1, and from 717 (1.22 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) to 699 mV (4 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) on emitter D2, and from 712 (1.94 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) to 703 mV (3.14 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) on emitter D3, respectively. However, with increasing the peak concentration on the same junction depth (e.g., emitter D1 with 1.15 – 2.23 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 , emitter D2 with 1.22–1.49 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3  and emitter D3 with 2.63–3.14 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ), the difference in the iV oc  values is below 2 mV, which can be ignored. However, there is a distinct effective lifetime at the excess carrier density from 1 ×10 14  to 1.5 ×10 16  cm �3 . And increasing the junction depth on the same peak concentration, a degradation iV oc  values as high as 27 mV is observed from 0.5 to 1.0   m (Fig. 8d). This trend is strong for the effective lifetime at the excess carrier density from 1 ×10 14  to 1.5 ×10 16  cm �3  (Fig. 8d and e). These results indicate that the junction depth has a stronger influence on the iV oc  and effective lifetime than the peak concentration. To obtain a suitable iV oc  and effective lifetime, an appropriate peak concentration and shallow junction of B-doped profiles are required. 3.5.I–V parameters Table 3 illustrates the I–V parameters of the cells at 4–5 pieces of solar cells per boron profile. And the box plots are shown in Fig. S3 and Fig. S4. The D3 sample with the peak concentration =1.94 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3  exhibited the best electrical performance, having a high E ff  (23.34%), high V oc  (702 mV), and high J sc  (41.01 mA/cm 2 ), rather than  Fig. 6.(a) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of emitter D3 sample (1.94 ×10 19  atoms/cm 3 ) surface after etching away the Ag–Al contact, the glass layer, the passivation layer, and all spikes.

A decrease of<10 mV in V oc  was observed at the deep p � -diffused region with 0.8   m, while for the shallow p � -diffused region with 0.5   m, the drop exceeds 15 mV on emitter N1and N2. It was indicated that the profile depth of B-doped can minimize the V oc  losses by effectively shielding the metal contacts from the minority charge carriers. Therefore, the junction depth is important as its calculation considers the effects of metal spikes penetrating the B- doped emitters (W¨ohrle et al., 2016). To derive a high J sc  and FF, a trade- off between the peak concentration and junction depth of the doping profile, which considers the effects of   c  and J 0e , is inevitable (Schmidt et al., 2018). According to Fig. 9a, the ideal efficiency would be more than 23.4%, which would be possible if the peak concentration and junction depth of B-doped profile were 1–1.5 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3  and 0.75–1.0   m, respectively. In Fig. 9b, the junction depth has a stronger influence on the V oc  than the peak concentration. To obtain a high V oc , a low peak concentration and deep junction of doping profiles are required due to the need to meet the conditions of corroded depth of the Ag/Al paste. To ascertain further the accuracy of the tested results, the total recombination activity in the cell (J 0e,total ) was calculated by using the measured values of J 0e,passivated  and J 0e,metal  according to equation (1). The saturation current density of the bulk (J 0,bulk ) was estimated from testing, about 8 fA/cm 2 . The cell V oc  was calculated from J 0e,total  using an ideal one-diode model and compared against the measured V oc . A detailed calculation of the total J 0e,total  and comparison of the calculated and measured V oc  values are shown in Table 4. The results show that there is a close match between the calculated V oc  and the cell’s measured V oc , except the peak concentration of 2.89 Θ10 19  atoms/cm 3  at d 1  �0.5   m.

To obtain a higher J sc , a lower peak con - centration and shallow junction of doping profiles are required because of the improved short wavelength response of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE). However, FF is positively correlated with the peak concentration and junction depth (Fig. 9d), and the change in FF is mainly influenced by R ser  (Fig. 9e). To obtain a high FF or a low R ser , a high peak concentration and deep junction are required. 3.6.Failure analysis A current loss was used to be discussed in order to understand the effects of the B-doped profile. The simulated optical reflectance was in agreement with the results of the experimental reflection without any adjustments (Fig. 10); we did not find any significant optical reflection for those samples. The primary difference of IQE for emitters D1–D3 (Fig. 10a-c) and N1–N2 (Fig. 10d-e) occurred at short wavelengths <550 nm; their blue responses were significantly degraded by the higher peak concentration and deep junction of the B-doped profile. Especially, the IQE for emitter N2 with 1.0   m exhibited a poor response at wave - lengths <1,000 nm. These curves show that the values of J sc  are decreased by increasing the peak concentration and junction depth of the B-doped profile, owing to the high recombination on the front sur - face (Fig. 9c�·e).

Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The loss of current density was analyzed via simulation (Fig. 11). Based on the Yablonovitch limit of 46.43 mA/cm 2 , the light-trapping ability of the solar cell may be estimated (Yablonovitch, 1987). From emitters D1–D3 (Fig. 11a-c) and N1–N2 (Fig. 11d-e), there were three main losses: one was the “blue loss” and the other “base collection loss.” Both losses lead to low short-circuit values. In this study, the recombination-induced current loss was due to the finite diffusion length in the emitter and in the wafer, which was mainly the higher peak concentration and deep junction of the B-doped profile. Especially, the deep junction 1.0um has a larger “blue loss” about 0.6 mA/cm 2  than others 0.3–0.4 mA/cm 2  and a larger “base collection loss” about 0.53 mA/cm 2  than others ¡0.35 mA/cm 2  This is consistent with the above QE results. The last type of loss was the “non-uniformity loss,” which mainly originates from the difference in current density between a high-quality spot on the wafer and the average of the wafer. In this study, the main reason for this loss was that the uniformity of front passivation on the lower peak concentration and shallow junction were difficult to be controlled. For emitters D2, D3 and N1, besides these three losses, an additional loss exists, called “NIR parasitic absorb,” which occurs due to unremoved the wraparound of rear B layer with a higher peak concen - tration on the deep junction in the same rear-etching condition. There - fore, a good rear planarization could reduce the NIR parasitic absorb loss and improve the efficiency of the solar cells. We must consider all these factors to optimize the front side passivation. The optimization of the B-doped process and front passivation could improve the efficiency and opticalproperties of the solar cells. Mean - while, B-selective emitters with few emitter recombination, low contact resistance, and good blue response must be further optimized in order to increase the efficiency of the n-TOPCon solar cells. 4.Conclusions The emitter dark saturation current density under the passivation layer (J 0e, passivated ), the metallization-induced recombination current density under the metal contact (J 0e, metal ), and the I–V parameters of the solar cell (J sc , V oc , FF and E ff ) were investigated as functions of the peak concentration and junction depth of B-doped profile. The best solar cell with a high E ff  (23.34%), V oc  (702 mV), and J sc  (41.01 mA/cm 2 ) was obtained using the B-doped profile with junction depth of 0.8   m and the peak concentration of 1.94 �10 19  atoms/cm 3 . The junction depth has a stronger influence on the V oc  than the peak concentration. A low peak concentration and deep junction of B-doped profiles are required for getting a high V oc . The J sc  and the peak concentration/junction depth of B-doped profile are negatively correlated. Both a low peak concentration and shallow junction of B-doped profiles are required for getting a high J sc , which can improve the blue response of the IQE. However, we observed a positive linear relation between FF and the peak concen - tration/depth junction; the change in FF was mainly influenced by R ser . The results revealed that there was a significant negative correlation between the contact resistance (  c ), iV oc , J sc  and the peak concentration, depth junction. However, the passivated emitter recombination (J 0e, passivated ) was positively correlated with the peak concentration and depth junction. The peak concentration was the most sensitive param - eter with respect to the metallization-induced recombination (J oe, metal ) in shallow emitters D1 and D2 compared with deep emitter D3, owing to a corroded depth of approximately 0.45–0.63   m. The primary differ - ence in the IQE for emitters D1–D3 and N1–N2 occurred at short wavelengths ¡550 nm. The primary difference of IQE for the deep emitter (1.0   m) had a poor bulk response at wavelengths ¡1,000 nm. Subsequently, the emitter doping profiles satisfy the conditions of corroded depth and   c  of the Ag/Al paste, a balance between the peak concentration and junction depth must be found for obtaining a good V oc  and FF. The optimization of B-diffusion processes (the peak concentration of 1–1.5 �10 19  atoms/cm 3 , junction depth of 0.75–1.0   m) and front passivation could improve the efficiency and opticalproperties of the solar cells. Meanwhile, B-selective emitters with low emitter recombi - nation, low contact resistance, and good blue response must be further optimized to increase the efficiency. After the optimization of B-selective emitters and passivation pro - cesses, we manufactured industrial-grade TOPCon cells with efficiency (E ff ), V oc , J sc , and FF values as high as 23.7%, 709 mV, 40.8 mA/cm 2 , and 82% respectively.

It was evidenced that the pyramid morphology not only impacted the reflection of incident light and the heterojunction interface passivation quality but also affected the interface contact property between transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer and Ag electrode. The texture with small pyramids presented the best anti-reflective and passivation performance due to the pyramidal size distribution uniformity, which brought the SHJ solar cell the highest short-circuit current density (J SC ) and open-circuit voltage (V OC ). However, the texture with small pyramids also led to the worst fill factor (FF). As a result, there was no obvious difference on the conversion efficiency for the textures with different pyramidal size. By characterizing the TCO/Ag contact, the FF reduction induced by the small pyramid texture could be attributed to the increased specific contact resistance of the TCO/Ag contact, which resulted from the fact that there were lots of voids between the TCO layer and Ag electrode, since Ag particles with a larger size than the small pyramids could not fill into the limited space between the adjacent pyramids. As a result, in order to realize the potential to enhance the SHJ solar cell conversion efficiency by adopting the texture with small pyramids, new Ag paste with smaller Ag particles should be adopted.    1.Introduction Planar crystalline silicon (c-Si) based solar cell has to face the problem of 30–40% reflection loss of the incident sunlight and low ab - sorption at long wavelength region because of the high refractive index of 3.8 and indirect band gap of c-Si. It has been found that the pyramidal texture obtained by wet anisotropic etching c-Si in alkaline solution can effectively reduce the reflection, increase the multiple reflection of the incident sunlight between the pyramids, and enhance the absorption (Angermann et al., 2009; Barrio et al., 2013; Edwards et al., 2008; Gangopadhyay et al., 2007; Mclntosh and Johnson, 2009; Seidel et al., 1990; Sundaram et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2015). Thus pyramid texturing has become a standard process for the c-Si solar cell fabrication. The industrialization of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell is nowadays developing rapidly due to its concise process, high efficiency and excellent power output performance. To learn the influence of the pyramidal texture morphology on the solar cell performance is very important for the SHJ solar cell fabrication. However, although a few of studies have been done, different or even opposite conclusions have been obtained. Some researchers considered that higher incident light reflection and lower current density could result from the small pyramid texture (Kang et al., 2011; Kegel et al., 2014; Mu˜noz et al., 2009; Singh  *Corresponding authors at: Key Laboratory of Solar Thermal Energy and Photovoltaic Systems of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China (L.

Ju et al. reported smaller pyramids could lead to lower reflection, higher current density and quantum efficiency (Ju et al., 2016). Xu et al. and Lien et al. pointed out that the incident light reflection was independent on the pyramid size and the more uniform was the pyramid, the smaller the reflection would be (Lien et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2019). For the interface passivation, Xu et al. reported that with the increase of pyramid size, the surface area and roughness were both increased, resulting in the difficulty for the passivation (Xu et al., 2019). Otherwise, Kegel et al. reported that the small pyramid resulted in small minority carrier lifetime due to lots of pyramid valley defects (Kegel et al., 2014). Kang et al. and Mu˜noz et al. also reported that it was relatively easy to obtain the better passivation effect on the texture with large pyramids (Kang et al., 2011; Mu˜noz et al., 2009). So it is still uncertain whether the texture with small pyramids can improve the SHJ solar cell efficiency or not. It is of great significance to investigate the influence of the textured pyramid size on the perfor - mance of the SHJ solar cell on a mass production line. To do this, three kinds of pyramidal textures with large, medium and small size respec - tively were prepared here by adjusting the concentration of KOH and additives, reaction temperature and reaction time. The results show that the texture with small pyramids could result in high short-circuit current density (J SC ) and open-circuit voltage (V OC ), but low fill factor (FF) for the SHJ solar cell. The underlying mechanisms were analyzed carefully via necessary characterizations. 2.Experimental N-type c-Si substrates with the size of M2, the thickness of about 180   m, the bulk minority carrier lifetime of about 1 ms, the resistivity of 1–5  cm, and the orientation of (100) were processed. Firstly, the saw damaged layer and the surface contamination were removed by the etching in 18 wt% KOH solution with temperature of 85  � C for 120 s. Then, the pyramidal texture was prepared on the substrate in dilute KOH solution with additive Pure Etch TK81 from HAYASHI PURE CHEMICAL IND., LTD. Different pyramids with large, medium and small size respectively were attained by adjusting KOH and additive concentra - tion, reaction temperature and process time. The specific experimental conditions are shown in Table 1. For each condition, 200 pieces of substrates were treated. After the pyramidal texturing, a short-time chemical polishing (CP) in the solution of 69% HNO 3  and 49% HF (ratio of 99.38%:0.62% in volume) was carried out for rounding the pyramid surface, especially the bottom and peak position of the pyra - mids to facilitate the subsequent amorphous silicon deposition. The CP process is beneficial to improve the passivation quality, but too long CP time will cause the increase of silicon wafer reflectivity, so the CP time for the large, medium and small pyramid is 120 s, 85 s and 20 s respectively. Further, standard Radio Corporation of America (RCA) treatments (Kern, 1993) were adopted to ensure the substrate surface clean. Finally, the substrates were dipped in a diluted aqueous solution of 49% HF (10% in volume) for 120 s to remove the native oxide on the surface, followed by a hot air drying with temperature of 80  � C for 450 s. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the obtained pyramids were observed by SEM (scanning electron microscope), the pyramid size and height were analyzed statistically by Zeta 3d instrument, and the reflectance of the substrates was tested by D8 reflectance tester. The size, base angle and uniformity of the pyramids may take effects with the incident light and thus influence the reflectance, which was simulated here by using the software of Wafer ray tracer developed by PV lighthouse. For the fabrication of the SHJ solar cell as shown schematically in Fig. 1, two intrinsic a-Si:H films were deposited on both sides of the  Fig. 1.Schematic structure of the SHJ solar cell.

The ITO target used in this work was composed of 90% In 2 O 3  and 10% SnO 2  by weight. Silver electrodes with 5-busbar were screen printed on the ITO films, and annealed at 190  ◦ C for 30 min. The effective minority carrier lifetime ( Δ eff ) was measured by a Sinton WCT-120 flash tester in tran - sient mode before ITO deposition. The implied V OC  was calculated ac - cording to the dependence of  Δ eff  at the excess carrier density of 5×10 15  cm -3 , and the pseudo-FF (pFF) was obtained by the Suns-Voc measure - ment on the finished cells also with Sinton WCT-120. External quantum efficiency (EQE) and reflectance spectra of the SHJ solar cells between the silver fingers were measured on Bentham PVE300-IVT system. Current-voltage (I-V) performance of the SHJ solar cells were taken by I- V tester under standard test condition (AM1.5G, 1000 W/m 2 , 25  ◦ C). The interfacial contact properties of ITO/Ag were measured by trans - mission length method (TLM), and the microstructure across the contact interface and the micromorphology of Ag paste was observed by scan - ning electron microscope (SEM). 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Pyramid morphology and optical reflection The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of textured pyramids are shown in Fig. 2. The statistical results of pyramid size and height are presented in Table 2. Apparently, three kinds of pyramids are prepared with the mean size of 1.5   m, 4   m, and 8   m respectively. The corre - sponding mean height is 0.9   m, 2.7   m and 3.9   m. The texture with small pyramids has the best distribution uniformity and the standard deviation (Std. Dev.) is the lowest for both the size and the height. As the pyramid size becomes bigger, the uniformity in size and height becomes worse. Especially as shown in Fig. 2(c), when the mean pyramid size is over 8   m, there also exist lots of small pyramids with the size below 1   m between the big pyramids, which results in the maximum Std. Dev. value for the texture with large pyramids. Fig. 3 shows the reflectance curves of the three kinds of pyramidal textures with different pyramid size. It’s clear that the smaller is the pyramid size, the lower the reflectance of incident light will be in the region of 350 nm to 1050 nm. Pyramid size and the corresponding angle change will affect the optical path of incident light and thus the reflec - tivity. Fig. 4 presents the simulation results on the relationship between the pyramid size and base angle with the reflectance of the pyramidal texture. The reflectance decreases dramatically from 37% for the planar surface to about 13% for the pyramidal texture regardless of the pyramid size is small or large. This means that ideal and uniform pyramids with different size can take the same effect on the reflectance. Lien et al. compared the reflection performance of silicon surface with different pyramid size from 1.4 to 3.3   m, respectively by a ray-tracing simulation and also demonstrated the undependence of the reflection on the pyr - amid size since the area and the base angle of the large pyramids were nearly as the same as those of the small pyramids (Lien et al., 2012). The higher reflectance for the texture should come from the uneven pyramid size distribution. Mu˜noz et al. prepared different samples with non- uniform small, uniform small, and uniform big pyramids respectively and found that the uniform small and the uniform big pyramids could demonstrate nearly the same lower reflection than the non-uniform  Fig. 3.Reflectance curves of three kinds of textures with different pyra - mid size.

J. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     small pyramids (Mu♡noz et al., 2009). Fig. 4 (b) shows the effect of the base angle of the pyramids on the reflectance. With the base angle in - creases from 25 ffi to 65 ffi , the reflectance decreases from 36.7% to 5.5% gradually. The larger is the base angle of the pyramid, the more possible it will be for the incident light to be rebounded on the edge of the pyr - amid, which can result in the favorable multiple absorption and low reflection. We measured the base angle of the obtained chemically polished pyramids here and found that the base angle was basically the same for the pyramids with different size. So the reason for the low reflectance of the texture with small pyramids can be attributed to the better uniformity of the pyramid distribution. As a matter of fact, the texture with small pyramids was prepared in low concentration KOH solution and high concentration additive was adopted. The high con - centration additive induced high density nucleation sites for the pyra - mid formation. However, the pyramid growth rate was low due to the relatively mild etching reaction of Si with the low concentration KOH. Under this condition, the prepared pyramids are uniform in size and distribution on the Si surface. Otherwise, for the preparation of the texture with large pyramids, high concentration KOH solution and low concentration additive were utilized. The density of the pyramid nucleation sites is low. The formed pyramids can grow rapidly with the etching of the high concentration KOH. In the end stage of pyramid growth, some large pyramids will be corroded and grow into the second cycle. Some new small pyramids may grow out randomly on the surface again, which deteriorates the uniformity of the pyramidal texture. 3.2.The SHJ solar cell performance Fig. 5(a) demonstrates the passivation performance of the semi- finished cells just after the deposition of intrinsic a-Si:H and doped a- Si:H (p, n). The results show that the highest  Δ eff  (2500   s), implied V OC  and pFF are obtained on the texture with small pyramids and all the  Fig. 5.(a) Passivation quality, (b) EQE, and reflectance spectra, and (c) I-V characteristics of the SHJ solar cells as functions of the pyramid size.   J. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     values descend with increase of the pyramid size. The  Δ eff  decreasing means more and more recombination is induced by the surface/interface defect states (Richter et al., 2012). The results indicate that it is difficult to effectively passivate the whole surface of the large pyramids due to the poor uniformity of the pyramid distribution. Singh et al. considered the reason for the difficulty to passivate the texture with large pyramids was that there existed sharp peaks and deep valleys on the surface (Singh et al., 2019). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the final SHJ solar cells are shown in Fig. 5(b). There is an EQE decrease in the region of 350 nm to 1100 nm, and the EQE-calculated J SC  reduces from 40.67 mA/cm 2  to 40.05 mA/cm 2  when the pyramid size increases. Obviously, the lowest reflectance from the uniform small pyramids plays an important role for the highest J SC.  I-V characteristics of the SHJ solar cells as functions of the pyramid size are given out in Fig. 5(c). For the texture with small pyramids, besides the highest J SC  with 38.5 mA/cm 2  is obtained, V OC  is also the highest, which is consistent with the above best passivation performance. But on the contrary, the FF is the lowest, which results in no perceptible gain in the conversion efficiency (Eff.). FF is related to the series resistance (Rs) in SHJ solar cell. As it shows in Fig. 6(a), FF and Rs are negatively correlated with pyramid size, small pyramid solar cells have higher Rs, which leads to lower FF. To explore the reason, the electrical performance and the microstructure of the ITO/Ag contact were characterized carefully. The specific contact re - sistivity of the ITO/Ag contacts obtained by TLM is shown in Fig. 6(b). The corresponding test pattern of ITO/Ag formed with metal mask is also depicted in Fig. 6(b). As a result, the specific contact resistivity of  Fig. 6.FF, series resistance (Rs) of SHJ solar cell and the specific contact resistivity of ITO/Ag interface.   Fig. 7.SEM micrographs of the ITO/Ag interface on the texture with (a) small pyramids, (b) medium pyramids, (c) large pyramids, and (d) the enlarged morphology of Ag particles used in the Ag paste.  J. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ITO/Ag contact is much higher on the texture with small pyramids than on the texture with medium or large pyramids. Fig. 7 further presents the ITO/Ag interface microstructure and the Ag particle micrograph used in the Ag paste by SEM. Clearly, there are lots of voids between ITO and Ag along the contact interface on the texture with small pyramids. In generally, the size distribution of silver particles is 0.3–1.5   m and the median size of Ag particles is more than 1   m. Due to the Ag particles are larger than the small pyramids, they are difficult to fill into the limited space between the adjacent pyramids. It is the contact discontinuity that results in the increase of the ITO/Ag contact resistivity. So in order to realize the potential to enhance the SHJ solar cell conversion efficiency by adopting the texture with small pyramids, new Ag paste with smaller Ag particles should be adopted. We also applied a reverse 12 V voltage to the SHJ solar cells under non-illumination conditions, the average leakage current on the large, medium and small pyramid texturing cells is 1.1 mA, 0.7 mA and 0.9 mA, respectively. Higher leakage current for the SHJ solar cell with large pyramids could attribute to the incomplete coverage of a-Si:H film at the peak and bottom of pyramids. 4.Conclusion Effects of the pyramidal texture with different average pyramid size of 8   m (large), 4   m (medium) and 1.5   m (small) on the incident light reflection, passivation and SHJ solar cell performance were studied. It was found that the texture with small pyramids presented the best anti- reflective and passivating performance due to the better distribution uniformity of the pyramids, which brought the SHJ solar cell the highest J SC  and V OC . However, the texture with small pyramids also led to the worst FF because of the increased specific contact resistivity of the ITO/ Ag contact. In order to realize the potential to enhance the SHJ solar cell conversion efficiency by adopting the texture with small pyramids, new Ag paste with smaller Ag particles should be adopted.

The selective poly-Si based passivating contacts (Poly-SEs) are ideal candidates for reducing the parasitic absorption and contact resistivity of n-type silicon solar cells and for providing better current collection. In this work, we used LPCVD and the POCl 3  tube furnace diffusion methods to fabricate the selective poly-Si based passivating contacts, and studied the influences of key process parameters of the SiO x  layer formation process (the oxidation duration (t oxidation ) and the constant pressure duration (t pressure )), and POCl 3  tube diffusion process parameters (the POCl 3 -N 2  carrier gas flow rate at the deposition, deposition temperature, drive-in temperature) on the n + -poly-Si profiles, recombination current density (J 0 ), contact resistivity (  c ) of n-TOPCon solar cells. The results showed that the t oxidation  and t pressure  had a significant impact on J 0  and   c  which were mainly related to the distribution number of O and Si 4+ content on the growth of the SiO x  layer. And the influence of the drive-in temperature of phosphorus (P) diffusion process on J 0  value is stronger than that of the deposition temperature, which was mainly related to the chemical passivation of SiO x  layer induced by P-indiffusion into Si at high temperature. The reduction in the thickness of poly-Si from 110 nm to 30 nm led to an increase in the short-circuit current density (J sc ) per nanometer of ~0.0093 mA/cm 2  per nm. The Poly-SEs were fabricated by 3D printing mask technology and secondary LPCVD/phosphorus diffusion with J 0, n+ ≈5 fA/cm 2  (n + -poly-Si layer ≈50 nm) and J 0, metal,n++ ≈73.8 fA/cm 2  (n ++ -poly-Si layer ≈110 nm), and the efficiency was improved by 0.12% owing to the increase in J sc  value of 0.28 mA/cm 2 . After optimizing the passivation process, the industrial-grade TOPCon bifacial cells reached an efficiency (E ff ), V oc , J sc , and FF values as high as 25.4%, 721 mV, 42.2 mA/cm 2 , and 83.5%, respectively.    1.Introduction Tunnel oxide passivated contact technology has attracted a lot of attention from researchers working in the areas of solar cells in recent years. Due to the potential for high theoretical limit efficiency as high as 28.7% and low cost [1], TOPCon solar cells have become one of the prospective technologies in the photovoltaic (PV) market [2]. At pre - sent, the highest efficiency for n-TOPCon has achieved 26.4% on an area of 330.15 cm 2  at JinkoSolar [3]. The TOPCon structure consists of an ultrathin silicon oxide (SiO x ) film and an n( + ) doped polysilicon (poly-Si) layer, which uses the concept of tunnel selectivity engineering. By employing thin SiO x  layer, it was possible to obtain the tunneling selectivity which allows electron transmission from Si to n + -poly-Si layer while holes are repelled. The ideal thickness of tunnel oxide (1–2 nm) is advantage for capturing the photo-generated current of the solar cell. This structure can provide low recombination current density (J 0 ) and low contact resistivity (  c ) simultaneously. R¨omer et al. [4] reported that the lowest J 0  was achieved to 0.66 fA/cm 2  for n + doped poly- - Si/SiO x  contact and 4.4 fA/cm 2  for p + doped poly-Si/SiO x  contact. It is worth noting that J 0  of p + -poly-Si layer is nearly 9 times higher than that  *Corresponding author.

On the one hand, it is different from the diffusivity of phosphorus and boron in poly-Si, SiO x  layer and c-Si wafer [5]. On the other hand, SiO x  layer can effectively inhibit the diffusion of phosphorus resulting in the formation of shallow doping profiles while boron readily diffuses into SiO x  layer leading to an increase in fixed oxide charges and interface trapped charge density, which further results in obtaining high J 0  and   c  values [6,7]. Many efforts and processes have resolved these problems, such as optimizing process parameters [8,9] and boron-doped silicon paste [10]. Selective emitter (SE) technology is an industry-relevant promising strategy which features a lightly doped emitter in the passivated region and a heavily doped emitter underneath the metal fingers, which of high doping concentration and deep depth can effectively reduce interfacial recombination losses and the contact resistance [10]. Typically, the local-area doping method can be achieved by various technologies, such as wet chemical etch-back [11], ion implantation [12], laser doping [13], screen printing of boron and phosphorus-containing pastes [14], inkjet printing of doping sources [15,16] and thermal diffusions [17]. However, most of these mentioned technologies have some risks in the manufacturing solar cell process due to the dopant diffusion, the damage to the Si surface and over-alignment losses in the alignment with the front electrode during the printing process [18]. Additional masking and etching processes need to prevent these problems and to control the doping profiles. In this work, the selective emitter is formed by 3D printing mask technology, which could avoid the surface damage caused by other methods such as laser-assisted doping. The fabrication of poly-Si films can be categorized into two main approaches—chemical vapour deposition (CVD) including plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) [19,20], low pressure CVD (LPCVD) [21,22], atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) [23] and hot wire CVD (HWCVD) [24] and physical vapour deposition (PVD) including sputtering [25,26] or electron beam evaporation [27]. The SiO x  layer can be grown by chemical oxidation [28], ozone oxidation [29] and PECVD [30]. LPCVD has been the primary technology for manufacturing industrial TOPCon cells because of its high throughput and simple process [31,32]. Up to now, most of the thickness values of poly-Si layers are over 70 nm [33]. To further improve the cell performance, the suitable ultra-thin doped poly-Si needs to be developed. Usually, a high thermal annealing step is used to crystallize a-Si layer into a doped poly-Si layer, and dopants from poly-Si layers can diffuse extensively into the c-Si and compromise the passivation quality during this process [34]. Therefore, how to balance the thickness of poly-Si layer and dopant diffusion remains as one of the challenging and critical tasks. After reviewing the previous publications [21,22,30–32], the effect of SiO x /n + -poly-Si process parameters on the n-TOPCon solar cells has not yet been thoroughly and deeply studied. Therefore, this study fo - cuses on the SiO x /n + -poly-Si process of n-TOPCon solar cells, which consisted of screen-printed metallic contacts on both sides fabricated from 182 mm ×182 mm ×0.14 mm Cz-Si wafers through an industrial-type process with the fixed Ag/Al and Ag pastes. To this end, the SiO x /n + -poly-Si process parameters with respect to their influences on the ECV profiles, J 0  and   c  were investigated. After optimizing the process, we simulated selective n + -poly-Si based passivating contacts (abbreviated as Poly-SE) formed by the 3D printing mask technology and secondary LPCVD/phosphorus diffusion and investigated their passivation performance, photoelectronic performance and the I-V pa - rameters of solar cells, i.e., efficiency (E ff ), open-circuit voltage (V oc ), fill factor (FF), series resistance (R ser ) and short-circuit current density (J sc ). 2.Experimental methods 2.1.Solar cell fabrication We manufactured the n-TOPCon cells from commercially available 182 mm ×182 mm n-type Cz–Si wafers with resistivity of 0.5 – 2  cm and thickness of 140 ±10   m. The wafers were textured in an alkaline (KOH) solution and subsequently cleansed in a solution of HF.The front Boron (B)-selective emitters (R ,p++ =75 /sq，R ,p+ =230 /sq) were formed in a quartz tube furnace containing BCl 3  gas using LYDOP™ system (Laplace) and Laser doping technology with the width of 90-100   m (DR laser, 532 nm, >20MKHz). After B diffusion, the rear side was polished by a mixed solution of HF and HNO 3 . Due to the boron silicate glass layer formed during the boron doping step, this layer acts as a polishing mask layer to protect the front structure during the pol - ishing process. The rear side stack, which consists of a SiO x  (1.6 ±0.2 nm) layer and an intrinsic a-Si (140 ±20 nm) layer, was formed by low- pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD). The as-prepared samples were then annealed in a tube furnace at 880  ◦ C for 45 min using a mixture gas of POCl 3 , O 2 , and N 2  to crystallize the a-Si to form poly-Si and simultaneously doped with phosphorus. Then, phosphorous sili - cate glass (PSG) was removed by etching in diluted HF solution, and the doping profiles of the SiO x /n + -poly-Si layers were tested by electro - chemical capacitance voltage (ECV) profiling. The J 0  of SiO x /n + -poly-Si layers under different process conditions was measured by two-side passivation of SiN x  using a Sinton WCT-120 system (Boulder, CO, USA). The thickness of SiN x  was 75 nm. Similar samples with acid- etched surface were screen-printed with Ag contact lines on only one side, with nine different pitches as the J 0, metal  test. The Ag paste was then exposed to fire in an industrial belt-firing furnace at a peak firing tem - perature of 735 ±5  ◦ C with the finger side facing up. The J 0,metal  values for the different metallization fractions f were calculated by the Weixin PL system (VS-6841A-210). Meanwhile, the contact resistivity (  c ) was obtained from the H patterns (16 busbar (BB) - 142 fingers) printed on one side of the J 0  sample of 0.8–1  cm n-type Cz–Si wafers. Fig. S1 shows the principle diagram of transfer-length-method. In this study, we investigated two key process parameters for the SiO x  layers (see Table 1 (i)), and three key process parameters for the phosphorus-diffused poly- Si contacts, respectively (see Table 1(ii)). The SiO x /n ++ -poly-Si and SiO x /n + -poly-Si layers of the selective poly-Si based passivating contacts on n-TOPCon with B-selective emit - ters, as shown in Fig. 1, were fabricated by 3D printing and secondary LPCVD/phosphorus diffusion respectively, and the cell fabrication sequence is displayed in Table 2. After acid-etched process, the rear SiO x /n ++ -poly-Si layer was formed in LPCVD and a high-temperature quartz tube furnace containing POCl 3  gas. The 3D printing mask tech - nology was placed on the metal contact area and then removed after removing the PSG and SiO x /n ++ -poly-Si layer in the non-mask area. Among them, the SiO x /n ++ -poly-Si layer was removed by a polishing process (KOH/polishing additives) in the non-mask area, whereas the PSG in the contact area acts as an etch mask. The SiO x /n + -poly-Si layer was also prepared in LPCVD with a high-temperature quartz tube furnace containing POCl 3  gas. After again cleaning the wafers again and removing boron silicate glass (BSG) and PSG, the poly-Si wraparound side was etched in inline treatment with HF and batch-type treatment with a mixed solution of KOH and polishing additives to obtain an SiO x / n + -poly-Si layer on only one side. Then, the front and rear passivation of the cell was carried out using 4 nm-AlO x /78 nm-SiN x  and 75 nm-SiN x , respectively. The wafer was metallized by screen-printing and firing of a metal paste using an H-patterned grid design on both sides. Commercial Ag/Al and Ag pastes were used as the finger of front and the rear metal grids, respectively. A 16-BB configuration was used for both the front and rear sides with floating busbar contact paste. The cells were then manufactured by fast firing in a conveyor belt furnace at a peak firing temperature of 735 ±5  ◦ C. 2.2.Characterization The current–voltage (I–V) parameters were measured using a Wavelabs tester. The implied V oc  (iV oc ) values of the control samples were determined using a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester under 1-sun illumination. The J 0  values of the samples were measured using WCT-  Q.

The SiO x /n + -poly-Si profiles of the monitor wafers were measured using an ECV device (WEP CVP21) with an etchant of 0.1 M NH 4 F solution. The   c  of the screen-printed metallized contacts with different profiles was determined using the transfer-length method (TLM) (GP-4 TEST). The optical reflectance of the cell was measured using a PVE300-IVT instrument. During these tests, the optical losses were analyzed using the Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 (the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore). 3.Results and discussion 3.1.The effect of poly-Si based passivating contacts processes 3.1.1.Influence of process parameters on the SiO x  layer The variables of the SiO x  formation process parameters were the oxidation duration (t oxidation )-the constant flow of O 2  fills the furnace tube for a certain time and the constant pressure duration (t pressure )- under the atmospheric pressure (760000 mTorr) and the total O 2  source, the SiO x  layer was deposited on the surface of Si for a certain time. Both influenced the SiO x /n + -poly-Si profiles, passivation performance (J 0 ) and contact resistivity (  c ) of n-TOPCon cells, analyzed using the LPCVD and POCl 3  tube furnace diffusion methods, and the results are shown in Table 1(i). The ECV profiles for the SiO x /n + -poly-Si layer under different SiO x  layer process conditions are shown in Fig. 2. In the first type, we varied the t pressure  under a constant t oxidation : 1) Condition 1 [ t oxidation  =5 min (t pressure  ≈5/10/20 min)] and Condition 2 [ t oxidation  =10 min (t pressure  ≈5/10/20 min)] are shown in Figs. 2a and 2b. In the second type, t ox - idation  was varied as the t pressure  was kept constant. Condition 3 [ t pressure  =10 min (t oxidation  ≈5/10/20/45 min)] is shown in Fig. 2c. Generally, there was little variation in the surface concentration of the ECV profiles which was always larger than 1 ×10 20  atoms/cm 3 , and the main dif - ference was at “knee-shaped” profile where the concentration of the  Fig. 1.n-TOPCon solar cell with selective poly-Si based passivating contacts.

Q. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    dopants in the poly-Si remained constant throughout the thickness of poly-Si and dropped just close to the poly-Si/SiO x /c-Si interface, and the“tail” of the dopant profile was defined as the part of the profile that diffused into the c-Si substrate from the surface concentration of 1 �10 20  atoms/cm 3  to 1 �10 19  atoms/cm 3 . Whenever t oxidation  and t pressure  were increased, the “knee-shaped” of the tail ECV profile became steeper. Because the thick oxide layer could prevent P from diffusing into Si with a steep tail ECV profile. Meantime, the quality of the SiO x  layer can also influence P diffusion [36]. This result would be confirmed by the further experiment. A comparison of SiO x /n � -poly-Si profiles measured by ECV with the corresponding SIMS profile reveals that the high amount of P dopants does not contribute to the electrical conductivity of the emitter (Fig. 3). The junction depth of SIMS profiles increases almost in equal proportion compared to ECV profile, about over 0.05   m at a dopant concentration of N �10 19  atoms/cm 3 . It is inferred that a relatively large P atoms were diffused into Si, which will provide a poor passivation. Fig. 4 shows the J 0  values of the SiO x /n � -poly-Si layers under two different process parameters. In the case of t pressure , J 0  increases from 5.2 to 7.8 fA/cm 2  with increasing the pressure duration from 5 to 20 min (Figs. 4a and 4b). This is consistent with the ECV profiles. For t oxidation , J 0  increases from 5.6 to 6.9 fA/cm 2  as oxidation duration increases from 5 to 20 min (Fig. 4c), while the t oxidation  �40 min, the J 0  had a high value of approximately 11 fA/cm 2 , which is more than 2 times than that of t oxidation  �5 min. From the above J 0  data analysis compared with the conditions 2 and 3, it can be concluded that t pressure  and t oxidation  had a significant impact on J 0  in the same total time of SiO x  process owing to the distribution number of O and Si 4� content on the growth of the SiO x  layer. The data analysis of XPS spectra shows that the distribution number of O and Si 4� content which is a key indicator of the quality of SiO x  layer. The higher the SiO 2  content, the better the passivation quality (Fig. S2). And a thick SiO x  layer was usually endowed with a relatively high passivation-quality but a poor tunneling selectivity, resulting in low FF. While the sheet resistance on p-type silicon of these three conditions has barely change, all of them are equal to around 50/ sq, it is indicated that under the same thickness of poly-Si layer, the thickness of SiO x  layer does not determine the total doping concentra - tion (Fig. S3). The contact resistivity,   c , for SiO x /n � -poly-Si layers with variations in the two key process parameters after sintering at 735 �5  � C is shown in Fig. 5. The confidence interval for the median of   c  is illustrated by the diamond-box plot. The   c  increased significantly from 1.4 to 1.8 m cm 2  to 4.2 m cm 2  by increasing the t pressure  from 5 to 20 min at t oxidation  �5 and 10 min, respectively (Figs. 5a and 5b). And for the varying t oxidation  process parameters,   c  can also be increased slightly from 2.5 to 3.9 m cm 2  as oxidation duration increased from 5 to 40 min, as shown in Fig. 5c. Both t pressure  and t oxidation  had a significant influence on   c  which was mainly related to the thick oxide layer without good tunneling effect rather than sheet resistance, resulting in high contact resistivity. This is consistent with the “knee-shaped” of the tail ECV profile. In this study, the cells with a SiO x  layer obtained under the 5 min t oxidation  -5 min t pressure  had a low J 0  5.2 fA/cm 2  and low   c  1.4 m cm 2 , which was attributed to the suitable thickness of the SiO x  layer to effectively control the P dopants diffusing into Si. In the subsequent studies, the 5 min t oxidation  -5 min t pressure  were used as the optimal technological condi - tions for the growth of SiO x  layer. 3.1.2.Influence of process parameters on the P doped poly-Si layer In order to study the passivation properties of a-Si layer, we designed three groups of experiments, as shown in Table 3. One is SiO x /a-Si layer without any process (abbreviated as Poly-unannealed), the second is SiO x /a-Si layer after annealing without phosphorus doping (abbreviated as Poly-annealed), and the last is SiO x /a-Si layer after annealing with phosphorus doping (abbreviated as n � -poly-Si). All of them were passivated by SiN x  layer and then tested for iV oc  before and after sintering. The iV oc  values of the n-TOPCon cells were measured using the quasi steady-state photoconductivity (QSSPC) technique, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. Before sintering, the Poly-annealed and n � -poly-Si samples have the same high iV oc  of about 740 mV, while the Poly- unannealed sample has the lowest iV oc  of about 719.8 mV, as shown in Fig. 6a. For the annealing or phosphorus doping process, the H atoms from SiH 4  gas in SiO x /a-Si layer can be released to passivate the defect density. However, as shown in Fig. 6b, after sintering at 735 �5  � C, the order of change in iV oc  for sintering samples compared to unsintering samples is Poly-annealed (40 mV) ⊤Poly-unannealed (15 mV) ⊤n � - poly-Si (8 mV). This high decreased iV oc  of Poly-annealed samples are partly owing to in the poor stability at high temperature. However, after phosphorus doping process, n � -poly-Si sample has a small change in iV oc , which is related to high temperature doping process fixing part of H atoms to escape. Through the above analysis, it finds why we choose the n � -poly-Si layer for the current high temperature process. However, how to control doping concentration of the as-prepared n � -poly-Si layer also needs to be considered. The influences of variables of the process parameters, including the POCl 3 -N 2  carrier gas flow rate at the deposi - tion (G POCl3 ), deposition temperature (T dep ), drive in temperature (T drive-in ) on the n � -poly-Si profiles, J 0 ,   c  and optical reflection of n- TOPCon cells were analyzed using the POCl 3  tube furnace diffusion method. The ECV profiles for the n � -poly-Si layer under different process conditions are shown in Fig. 7. G POCl3  was set as 1200, 1600, 2000 and 2400 sccm using a single-variable process parameter, Fig. 7a shows the ECV profiles as a function of G POCl3 . T dep  was set as 770, 790 and 810  � C, and the ECV profiles as a function of T dep  are shown in Fig. 7b. T drive-in  was set as 860, 880, 900 and 905  � C, and the ECV profiles as a function of T drive-in  are shown in Fig. 7c. Generally, it can be found that the profiles were influenced much more by the process temperature than the POCl 3 -N 2  carrier gas flow. G POCl3  was much less sensitive while the value was more than 1200 sccm (Fig. 7a). This was mainly because POCl 3  deposition at a relatively low temperature led to low phosphorus diffusivity. In particular, T dep  had a significant impact on the surface concentration of the profiles. With increasing T dep , more dopants were diffused into the poly-Si layer as shown in Fig. 7b. With increasing T drive-in , there is the almost same surface concentration, but it affects the “knee-shaped” of the tail ECV profile (Fig. 7c). For example, when T drive-in  achieved to 905  � C, there is a sharply drop and then a rise again, indicating that more phosphorus diffused into SiO x  layer and decreased the passivation performance.

Q. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Fig. 8 shows the J 0  values of the n + -poly-Si layers under three different process parameters. In the case of G POCl3 , J 0  increases from 5.6 to 8.7 fA/cm 2  with increasing POCl 3 -N 2  carrier gas flow from 1600 to 2400 sccm (Fig. 8a). However, when G POCl3  drops to 1200 sccm, the J 0  increases to 6.5 fA/cm 2 . Under the condition of G POCl3  =1200 sccm, the flow rate of POCl 3  is lower compared to other conditions. As a result, the  Fig. 4.J 0  values in the passivated regions of (a) Condition 1 (t oxidation  =5 min, t pressure  =5/10/20 min), (b) Condition 2 (t oxidation  =10 min, t pressure  =5/10/20 min) and (c) Condition 3 (t pressure  =10 min, t oxidation  =5/10/20/40 min).

Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    concentration of Phosphorus-dopants on the surface is low, leading to a reduced number of Phosphorus-dopants diffusing into the surface. Consequently, there is insufficient energy band bending occurring into the surface, which results in the poor field effect passivation. For T dep , J 0  exhibits a small change of approximately 1 fA/cm 2  with increasing T dep  from 770 to 810  ◦ C (Fig. 8b). For T drive in , J 0  shows a slight decrease from 10 to 4.9 fA/cm 2  as T drive in  increases from 860 to 900  ◦ C (Fig. 8c), while the T drive in  achieved to 905  ◦ C, the J 0  increased to 9 fA/cm 2 , which is consistent with the ECV profiles, which is owing to destroying the quality of SiO x  layer and leading to the poor passivation. From the above J 0  data analysis, it can be concluded that the drive-in temperature had the greatest impact on J 0 , followed by the POCl 3  -N 2  carrier gas flow rate at the deposition, which is mainly related to the chemical passivation of SiO x  layer induced by P-indiffusion into Si at high temperature and the field effect passivation induced by doping concentration. Fig. S4 shows the R   of the n + -poly-Si layers under p-type silicon with variations of the three key process parameters. The surface con - centration of n + -poly-Si layer is high, the sheet resistance is low, which is mainly owing to total doping level.

Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    at the deposition are shown in Fig. 10, the etched surface without n � - poly-Si layer has only one peak at wavelength of about 400 nm, and the reflectance (R) reaches to 45%. However, the samples with n � -poly-Si layer contain two peaks at wavelengths of 450 and 550 nm, and the R value is smaller than that of the etched surface at wavelengths of 450~ 800 nm. From the above analysis, the poly-Si layer is unsuited to be deposited in the front of solar cell due to much more parasitic absorption loss. Maybe it is because that the proportion of a-Si in poly-Si would retain approximate 20% after a high-temperature annealing process and the absorption coefficient of a-Si:H is higher than that of poly-Si in the wavelength of 400–700 nm for intensive photon energy leading to a high parasitic absorption loss [23,37]. On the contrary, it is suitable for the rear of solar cell. The R increased by decreasing G POCl3  from 2400 to 1200 sccm, which has a high free carrier absorption (FCA) loss probably due to high doping, it is consistent with ECV profiles (Fig. 7a). From the above n � -poly-Si layers data analysis, it can be concluded that the low doping concentration would lead to low FCA loss. A balance between the J sc  and FF is to find an appropriate doping concentration of n � -poly-Si layer. 3.2.Selective poly-Si based passivating contacts 3.2.1.Preparation and simulation To select an appropriate n � -poly-Si layers diffusion process, we fabricated five types of n � -poly-Si layers on the polished surface by the change of the LPCVD deposition time and diffusion process parameters (Table 1(iii)). The ECV profiles, sheet resistance, J 0 ,   c , and near- infrared (NIR) parasitic absorbance current loss analysis of the n � - poly-Si layers are shown in Fig. 11. Generally, as shown in Fig. 11a, all of n � -poly-Si layers have nearly the same surface concentration of more than 1 �10 20  atoms/cm 3  and almost the same “knee-shaped” of the tail ECV profile with the thickness of n � -poly-Si layers, which were annealed at the same high temperature with adjusting P diffusion process. While the sheet resistance on p-type silicon was increased from 56 to 164 /sq with decreasing the thickness of n � -poly-Si layers from 110 to 30 nm (Fig. 11b). The values of n � -poly-Si layers exhibit a minor change of approximately 0.5 fA/cm 2  with the thickness from 50 to 110 nm, while the thickness of 30 nm has a high J 0  value of ⊤13 fA/cm 2  which in - dicates that the thickness of ℜ50 nm cannot provide an effective field effect passivation (Fig. 11c). However, the   c  has a remarkable change, which decreased from 2.7 to 0.9 m cm 2  by increasing the thickness from 30 nm to 110 nm owing to the total doping concentration (Fig. 11d). Subsequently, the NIR parasitic absorbance current loss density was analyzed by Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 software (Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore), and the linear variation of NIR parasitic absorbance current loss density with the n � -poly-Si layer thickness for all samples is shown in Fig. 11e. The slope of the current loss density against the thickness of n � -poly-Si layer is equal to NIR parasitic absorbance current loss density per nanometer, which is thought to be related to the thickness of n � -poly-Si layer about 0.0093 mA/cm 2  per nm. In a word, the n � -poly-Si layers need to satisfy high- quality passivation and low parasitic absorption. While the n � -poly- Si layers need to satisfy the conditions of corroded depth and   c  of the Ag paste, so the above analysis is proposed to assume 110 nm as n � -poly-Si layer. The photograph of screen-printing pattern of the n � -poly-Si layer sample with different metallization fractions is shown in Fig. 12a and the values of J 0,metal,n� �73.8 fA/cm 2  are displayed in Fig. 12b based on a simple linear interpolation of the measured data points calculated by the previous research method [35]. We simulated one batch of BKM (best known method, 110 nm) solar cells and Poly-SEs with different n � -poly-Si layers on n � -poly-Si layer (110 nm) using Griddler 2.5, and the total saturation current density in the cell (J 0,total ) and the J 0  on the rear non-metallized area (J 0,passivated area (rear) ) was calculated using the measured values of J 0  and J 0,metal  ac - cording to Eq. (1) and (2), respectively. And the J sc  value was estimated on the reference value of 41.63 mA/cm 2  which is obtained by calcu - lating the metal shielding area through Griddler 2.5 simulation, and NIR parasitic absorbance current loss density of n � -poly-Si layer according to Eq. (3). The saturation current density of the bulk material (J 0,bulk ) was estimated to be 5 fA/cm 2 . The cell V oc  and FF values were calculated from J 0,total  and   c  using an ideal one-diode model,the data related to B- SE simulation came from the previous studies [7] and the cell efficiency values were calculated by formula E ff  �V oc  �J sc  �FF, the results are shown in Table 4. The Poly-SE with a n � -poly-Si layer of 50 nm had a higher E ff  of approximately 24.58%, thus obtaining a gain of 0.18% compared to BKM (110 nm), mainly owing to the increase J sc  of 0.49 mA/cm 2  and a slight advantage of J 0,total . We could not obtain a high FF, mainly because of the high lateral resistance of the n � -poly-Si layer.

The mask line of the n � -poly-Si layer was relatively uniform with the 3D printing mask, the width of the mask line decreased from 180 to 150   m after polishing and RCA washing, and the mask line became smooth and clear, as shown in Fig. 13. The surface concentrations of the n � and n � -poly-Si layers were 2.1 �10 20  and 1.85 �10 20  atoms/cm 3  respectively, and the thickness values of the n � and n � -poly-Si layers were 50 and 110 nm, respectively (Fig. 11a), which provides a good photoelectronic perfor - mance for the lightly doped areas. The low J 0,n� and J o,metal,n� values were measured to be 5 fA/cm 2  and 73.8 fA/cm 2 , respectively (Figs. 11c and 13b), which indicates the lightly and heavily doped areas exhibited a good passivation performance. 3.2.2.Cell performance The results of the iV oc  values and lifetime of the precursor structure are shown in Fig. S5. The Poly-SE solar cells did not show a good passivation performance, in which iV oc  decreased by only 1 mV compared with BKM, and the lifetime decreased by 17   s. Table 5 lists the I–V parameters of the BKM and Poly-SE solar cells. Poly-SE shows a higher J sc  of approximately 0.28 mA/cm 2  compared with BKM, which is attributed to the thin thickness of n � -poly-Si layer.

Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, there is a slightly fall for the V oc  of approximately 0.3 mV, which can be negligible. While R s  decreased, FF did not show any advantage, which may be owing to the influence of the high resistance of the n þ -poly-Si layer. However, in the best cell, R s  slightly increased, and FF also slightly increased which may be owing to the influence of the bulk time of Si wafer. The overall median efficiency increased by 0.12%. These results are basically consistent with the above simulation analysis, the only difference is the less gain of current density, which is mainly owing to the effect of manufacturing process of solar cells (RCA washing, the uniformity of sheet resistance and the line width/height of screen printing,etc.). 3.2.3.Failure analysis To understand the effects of the Poly-SE solar cells, the current loss analysis was carried out using the Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 software (based on the Yablonovitch limit of 46.43 mA/cm 2 ) as shown in Fig. 14. Here, there are three primary advantages of Poly-SE from BKM, the one is ""NIR parasitic absorption loss"", the J sc  is increased by 0.59 mA/cm 2 , which is related to the rear polished surface and the thin thickness of the n þ -poly-Si layer. It is consistent with the result of simulation. The others are “blue loss” and “base collection loss”, which get benefit from the additional RCA cleaning (Clean 1) and the gettering effect of P doping diffusion process. However, Poly-SE showed a disadvantage in terms of “ARC reflectance” and “Front surface escape”, which is related to the polishing process leading to damage the front surface texture and to increase the reflectance. After process optimiza - tion, the J sc  value of Poly-SE can be further increased. To improve the optical performance of n-TOPCon solar cells by simplifying the Poly-SE solar cell preparation process and optimizing the polishing process will be the future research direction.

The t oxidation  and t pressure  had a significant impact on J 0  and   c  values in the same total time of SiO x  process, which was mainly related to the distribution number of O and Si 4+ content on the growth of the SiO x  layer. The drive-in temperature of P diffusion process had a stronger influence on J 0  than the deposition temperature, which was mainly related to the chemical passivation of SiO x  layer induced by P- indiffusion into Si at high temperature. Subsequently, we designed different thicknesses for the n + -poly-Si layers. There was a significant positive correlation between   c  and sheet resistance and the thickness of n + -poly-Si layer. The reduction in the thickness of poly-Si from 110 nm to 30 nm led to an increase in the short- circuit current density (J sc ) per nanometer of ~0.0093 mA/cm 2  per nm, however, J 0  values exhibited a minor change with the thickness from 50 to 110 nm. The analysis of high   c  and J 0  values showed that for poly-Si layers with thickness of 30 nm, the paste might have spiked at the interface of SiO x /n + -poly-Si. Based on the simulation results, we prepared Poly-SEs with J 0, n+ ≈5 fA/cm 2  (n + -poly-Si layer ≈50 nm) and J 0, metal,n++ ≈73.8 fA/cm 2  (n ++ - poly-Si layer ≈110 nm), using 3D printing mask technology and sec - ondary LPCVD/phosphorus diffusion. There was an efficiency gain of 0.12% owing to the increase in J sc  value of 0.28 mA/cm 2 , mainly owing to the thin thickness of n + -poly-Si layer. The overall contribution of the Poly-SE to V oc  of the solar cells is negligible. Through the optical loss analysis, the primary loss of Poly-SE from BKM was taken from ARC reflectance and Front surface escape, which was related to the polishing process leading to damaging the front sur - face texture and increasing the reflectance. After optimizing of the passivation process, the industrial-grade TOPCon bifacial cells reached an efficiency (E ff ), V oc , J sc , and FF values as high as 25.4%, 721 mV, 42.2 mA/cm 2 , and 83.5%, respectively.

The effect of different passivated contact layers with respect to their influence on the J0, J0,metal, ρc, and the carrier selectivity (S10) and the loss analysis and efficiency potential of industrial- type PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ solar cells were studied and compared. The results showed that TOPCon structure with a high passivation performance and good optical performance is more suitable for bifacial solar cell and the high-est theoretical limiting efficiency with metal shading on the n- type Si wafer (ηb,e,h,m,max) can be achieved to 27.62%. Although SHJ structure with the highest passivation performance but the worst optical performance owing to the parasitic absorption of a- Si:H layer and high contact resistivity, the value of ηb,e,h,m,max is 0.7% lower than that of TOPCon solar cells. PERC structure has superior optical performance than SHJ structure, but due to poor passivation performance, the ηb,e,h,m,max is only 26.42%. The next- generation products may be heterojunction back- contact (HBC) and TOPCon back- contact (TBC) cells with high ηb,e,h,m,max of 28.12% and 27.99%, respectively. Exploiting a perfect passivation of the noncontact area, the wide process window and low cost are required and transferring these new concepts to industrial solar cell production will be the next major challenge.1   |   IntroductionThe solar industry has been attracting attention as a future energy source. Crystalline silicon (c- Si) has the unique features, such as nontoxicity, abundant source, and long- term stability, which has made it a market- dominant technology with an almost 95% mar-ket share [1]. The passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells are derived from the conventional aluminum back surface field (Al- BSF) structure, which was developed by Green etal. at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1989 [2]. However, this technology took 30 years to achieve large- scale production. The production capacity of PERC cells has grown exponentially, and the market share of PERC p- type mono- Si was 80% in 2022 accord-ing to the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) [3]. The efficiency of p- type monocrystalline PERC cells has been increasing at an absolute efficiency of 0.5% per year [4] and has reached 23%23.5% in large- scale production [5, 6]. The rapid increase in cell efficiency cannot be attributed to improvements  © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. [Correction added on 19 September 2024, after first online publication: The second corresponding author has been changed from Wangping Wu to Jianning Ding in this version.] Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, 2024in device structure alone; at the same time, it is a combination of some aspects of the cell manufacturing process. Starting from the substrate material, thinner and higher quality Si wafers with lower impurity concentrations and crystal defects greatly suppress the loss of substrate composite materials and provide a prerequisite for manufacturing high- efficiency solar cells. The development and implementation of processes to mitigate boronoxygen (BO)- related light- induced degradation (LID) as well as photothermal attenuation (LeTID) [79] in Ga- doped p- type direct- drawn silicon (Cz) growth [10, 11] have improved the long- term stability of PERC solar cells. In addition, improvements in surface passivation ma-terials and techniques, such as the use of thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2)/silicon nitride (SiNx:H) stacked layers on the front surface [1215] and AlOx/SiNx layers on the back surface [1618], have reduced carrier recombination on the surface. The introduc-tion of selective emitter (SE) structures can effectively separate the requirement to form high- quality ohmic contacts from the design of diffuse emitters in the passivation region [1922]. These regions function as membranes that block minority carriers and conduct majority carriers [23] and thereby define the direction of current flow and make the solar cell work. Heavy doping (n++) forms a local electric field on the surface silicon, sweeping holes back into the c- Si and accelerating electron conduction to the electrode [24]. Subsequently, more lightly doped emitters and screen- printed sil-ver pastes designed to form effective contacts with such emitters have been used in PERC cells, resulting in improved front surface passivation and spectral response without compromising con-tact resistance. In addition, the developments in screen printing techniques, such as knotless screen printing, dual printing, twice printing, multibusbar technology, and reduced finger widths, have been developed to reduce the optical and resistive losses in the front grid lines [2528], which can significantly improve the effi-ciency of PERC cells.In 2019, LONGi reported efficiencies of 23.83% and 24.06% [29] for champion PERC cells. In 2022, Trina announced that the high- efficiency PERC solar cell with size of 210 × 210 mm has an efficiency of 24.5%, which is also the highest efficiency re-cord of the PERC structure so far [30]. This efficiency reached 24.5% of the PERC theoretical performance efficiency calculated by Schmidt etal. [31], and the PERC structure had reached the technical bottleneck. The passivated emitter with rear locally diffused (PERL) solar cell, as an upgraded structure of the PERC solar cell, diffuses over the back metallized contact area to form a local p+ structure. In 2009, the UNSW published PERL's high-est efficiency record of 25.0% [32]. However, the average effi-ciency of the industry's mass- produced PERC solar cells is much lower than the champion efficiency. Most of the losses are re-combination at the metal contacts and the loss caused by two-  or three- dimensional current transport paths. Therefore, passiva-tion contact has been a hot research topic in the photovoltaics (PV) industry. Currently, the TOPCon structure consists of an ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) film and a n(+)- doped polysilicon (poly- Si) layer, which utilizes the concept of tunnel selective en-gineering. Martin Green first proposed the concept of passive contact. In 1972, Green etal. [33] showed how tunneling a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) contact could increase the open- circuit voltage (Voc) by more than 60 mV over a standard pn junction. In 1981, Martin Green and his group are the first to pro-pose the passivation contact structure with doped poly- Si/SiOx/Si, and in 1983, they disclosed an 18% efficiency based on this structure, which was the first polycrystalline siliconbased solar cell [34]. However, in the following decades, the study of pas-sivation contact has not been widely concerned and applied. Regarding the notation, poly- Si emitters or semi- insulating poly- Si (SIPOS) emitters [35, 36] were used in the first reports of this contact scheme. What triggered the public rediscovery of TOPCon was Feldman and Fraunhofer, who reported in 2013 that TOPCon had replaced BSF, with VOC elevated to 698 mV [37]. Since then, polysilicon/silicon oxide contacts have been reintro-duced into the field of solar cells. TOPCon structure is achieved by introducing tunneling barriers (such as ultrathin dielectric layers) into selective contact structures, resulting in asymmet-ric tunneling probabilities of electrons and holes (such as due to changes in barrier height or effective tunneling mass). For ex-ample, it has been proven that ultrathin SiO2 layers have a larger hole tunneling barrier compared to electrons [38]. TOPCon solar cells have become one of the prospective technologies in the PV market [39]. At present, TOPCon solar cell is one of the main-stream products with a median efficiency of 25%26% [40]. This is due to advancements in surface passivation materials, struc-tures, and technology, including the use of AlOx/SiNx layers on the front surface, boron SE structures with high concentration doping beneath in the metal contact area and low concentration doping in the uncontacted area[41, 42], multi- busbar technology [43], laser- enhanced contact optimization (LECO) technology, a low- corrosion paste to reduce passivation layer damage [44], laser irradiation generated carriers and formed current with a reverse voltage, contact area optimization [4547], poly- SE with reducing parasitic absorption while retaining good contact [48, 49], and so on. Meanwhile, SunPower, TetraSun, and Silevo companies were also manufacturing on passivating contact solar cells, with technical information withheld from the public do-main. According to the ITRPV [3], the share of p- type mono- Si PERC will decrease to about 10% in the next 10 years. TOPCon will gain market share from about 10% by 2022 up to 60% in the next decade. Based on these results, it took about 10 years to commercialize it. TOPCon on n- type is expected to become the dominating cell concept after 2025. The highest efficiency for n- TOPCon has achieved 26.89% with a specific surface area of 330.15 cm2 at JinkoSolar [50]. POLO- IBC cells with an efficiency of 26.1% were reported with a specific surface area of 4 cm2 [51]. There are two key factors limiting the efficiency of TOPCon cells. One is the loss caused by boron heavy doping, which en-hances the saturation current density J0 in the passivated contact region [52], and the other is recombination at the p+ layer metal contacts, which are a current challenge for PV manufacturing.SHJ cell technology, the second important n- type passivation contact, which is a structure with a monocrystalline silicon wafer sandwiched between nanometer- thick n- type (p- type) doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a- Si:H) layers and passivation and base contacts deposited by low- temperature plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on Si bulk materials, was reported by Walther etal. at the University of Marburg in 1974 [53]. This type of carrier- selective contact is also known as heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) contact [54]. The p- type or n- type doping of a- Si:H causes band bending of the work function (WF), leading to carrier selec-tivity. By selecting functional materials that match the band structure, a high potential barrier for holes and a small or even zero potential barrier for electrons can be directly formed at the  890 interface, ensuring both J0 and ρc to form the optimal electron selective transport [24]. The first solar cell using a silicon het-erojunction was reported in 1983 by Hamakawa etal. in the form of an a- Si:H/poly- Si heterojunction bottom cell in a tan-dem junction solar cell, called honeymoon cell [55]. At the same time, the electronic junction between doped a- Si:H and c- Si was largely investigated [56]. In the late 1980s, Sanyo (Japan) started to incorporate heterojunctions into c- Si wafer- based solar cells. In recent years, SHJ technology has gained increas-ing attention within the PV industry due to their high efficiency, low- temperature processes, good temperature coefficients, and high bifacial rates [5760]. In 2022, LONGi raised the world re-cord power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 26.81% (274cm2, M6 size) [61], approaching the fundamental limit of single- junction Si solar cells (29.4%) [62]. In 2023, interdigitated back- contact (IBC) structure was combined with the SHJ solar cells, reaching a record PCE of 27.09% [63]. In 2024, LONGi has set a new re-cord for PCE for silicon heterojunction back- contact (HBC) cells, 27.3% [64]. In recent years, with the development of technologies such as nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc- SiOx:H) films [6567], multi- busbar [43], phosphorus (P) gettering [68], and wavelength conversion film [69], more industry participants joined the mar-ket of SHJ solar cell. As predicted by the ITRPV [3], SHJ solar cells are expected to gain a 2023 market share of about 9% to over 25% in the next decade. Based on these results, it took about 30 years to commercialize it. At present, some enterprises have carried out mass production of SHJ solar cells, and the mass production efficiency is about 25.0%25.8% [40]. A trade- off of the cost and output power of SHJ solar cells is still an obstacle to its expanding market share. Being different from any previ-ous scalable c- Si PV generations, the SHJ cell features uniquely indispensable transparent conducting oxide layers integrating a low- temperature annealing metal paste and high equipment investment. The unique electrode and equipment requirement is still the dominant factor to determine its rate of exposure mass manufacture technology [44].According to ITRPV's prediction [3], it appears that developing the passivating selective contact technology has become a hot topic for the next mass production of solar cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was focused on the effect of different pas-sivated contact layers with respect to their influence on the J0, J0,metal, ρc, and the carrier selectivity (S10). At the same time, we simulated three types of solar cell (PERC, TOPCon and SHJ), which consisted of screen- printed metallic contacts on both sides fabricated from 182 m× 182 × 0.14 mm Cz- Si wafers through an industrial- type process; further investigated their passivation performance, optical performance, and the IV parameters of solar cells, that is, efficiency (Eff), open- circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and short- circuit current density (Jsc); and finally discussed its current status and future trends.2   |   Experimental2.1   |   Solar Cell FabricationWe fabricated three types of samples. Figure1 shows the sche-matic depiction of the sample structure in order to extract the passivation layer (J0): (I) the P- doped n+ sample with a symmet-ric double- sided P- diffused with SiOx/SiNx on 5 Ω·cm p- type Cz- Si wafers; (II) the P- doped n++ sample with a symmetric double- sided laser doping the P- doped n+ sample with SiOx/SiNx on 5 Ω·cm p- type Cz- Si wafers; (III) the B- doped p+ sam-ple with a symmetric double- sided B- diffused and passivation with AlOx/SiNx stacks on 5 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wafers; (IV) the B- doped p++ sample with a symmetric double- sided laser doping the B- doped p+ sample and passivation with AlOx/SiNx stacks on 5 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wafers; (V) the SiOx/n+- poly- Si sample with a symmetric double- sided SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer with AlOx/SiNx stacks on 5 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wafers; (VI) the SiOx/p+- poly- Si sample with a symmetric double- sided SiOx/p+- poly- Si layer and passivation with AlOx/SiNx stacks on 5 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wa-fers; (VII) the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) sample with a symmetric double- sided a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer with indium- tin oxide (ITO) stacks on 5 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wafers; (VIII) the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) sample with a symmetric double- sided the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer with ITO stacks on 5 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wa-fers; (IX) the passivation sample with a symmetric double- sided passivation with AlOx/SiNx stack on 5 Ω·cm p- type Cz- Si wa-fers; the metallization- induced recombination (J0e, metal) sample with metal contacts printed on one side of the (II), (IV), and (IX) with laser ablation samples on 5 Ω·cm p- type Cz- Si wafers and (V), (VI), (VII), and (VII)samples on 5 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wa-fers according to the previous methods [70]; the measurement of specific contact resistance (ρc) sample with H patterns on one side [70] of the (II), (IV), and (IX) with laser ablation sample on 0.52.1 Ω·cm n/p- type Cz- Si wafers and (V), (VI), (VII), and (VII) sample on 0.52.1 Ω·cm n- type Cz- Si wafers.Then, we manufactured the three types of solar cells from commercially available 182 × 182 mm CzSi wafers with thick-ness of 140 ± 10 µm. Figure2 shows the schematic depiction of the three types of structural cells. The fabrication sequence of PERC cell is shown in Table1. p- Type Cz- doped Ga monocrys-talline silicon wafers with the resistivity of 0.51.2 Ω·cm were textured in alkaline solution, followed by cleaning in HCl/HF mixed solution. The front P- selective emitters (R,n++ = 135 Ω/sq, R,n+ = 230 Ω/sq) were formed in a quartz tube furnace con-taining POCl3 gas (Sevenstar) and laser doping technology with the width of 90100 µm (DR laser, 532 nm, > 20 MKHz). After P diffusion, the rear side was polished by a mixed solution of KOH and polished additives. Subsequently, the front and rear passiva-tion of the cells were achieved by thermal oxidation tube of SiOx layer with thickness of 12 nm and PECVD of 80- nm- thick SiNx dielectric stacks on the front side and ALD AlOx 35 nm and PECVD 80- nm- thick SiNx dielectric stacks on the rear side and then by laser ablation on the rear side with width of 2035 µm (DR laser). The metallization was achieved by screen printing and firing of a metal paste using an H- patterned grid design on both sides of the wafers. A good contact is then formed using a firing temperature of 820°C.The fabrication sequence of TOPCon cell is shown in Table1. The n- type monocrystalline silicon wafers with a resistivity of 0.52.1 Ω·cm were also textured in alkaline solution and sub-sequently cleansed in an HCl/HF mixed solution. The front boron (B) SE (R,p++ = 75 Ω/sq, R,p+ = 230 Ω/sq) were formed in a quartz tube furnace containing BCl3 gas (Sevenstar) and laser doping technology with the width of 90100 µm (DR laser). After B diffusion, the rear side was also polished by a mixed solution of KOH and polished additives.

After removing BSG/PSG [71], the front and rear passivation of the cells were achieved by 35- nm- thick AlOx by ALD and 80- nm- thick SiNx dielectric stacks by PECVD. The metallization was achieved by screen printing and firing of a metal paste using an H- patterned grid design on both sides of the wafers (735 ± 5°C).The fabrication sequence of SHJ cell also is shown in Table1. The n- type monocrystalline silicon wafers with a resistivity of 13 Ω·cm were begun with an ozone cleaning process. The wafer gettering process was applied to improve its lifetime. Subsequently, the wafers were textured and cleaned by RCA solution. The intrinsic a- Si:H layers were deposited on both sides of wafers using a commercial PECVD system (13.56 MHz) at a low temperature. Then, the n- doped and p- doped nanocrystal-line layers were deposited on the front and rear surfaces of the silicon substrate via a high- frequency PECVD system. Both the front and rear sides were deposited by indium tin oxide (ITO) films with the thicknesses of 100 and 120 nm, respectively. The metallization was achieved by screen printing and firing of a metal paste using an H- patterned grid design on both sides of the wafers (200°C, 30 min).2.2   |   CharacterizationThe currentvoltage (IV) parameters were measured using a vision tester. The implied Voc (iVoc) values of the controlled samples were determined by a lifetime tester under 1- sun il-lumination (WCT- 120 Sinton, Boulder, CO, USA). The J0 and J0,metal values of the samples were measured by WCT- 120 Sinton and extracted at the excess carrier density of 3 × 1015 cm3 [60] (Boulder, CO, USA). The ρc of the screen- printed metallized contact with different samples was determined by the transfer length method (TLM) (GP- 4 test). The optical reflectance of the cell was measured by PVE300- IVT. During these tests, the op-tical losses were analyzed by Current Loss Analysis Calculator V1.4 (the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore) [72].3   |   Results3.1   |   The Emitter Dark Saturation Current DensityTo better investigate the effect of passivation, the J0 values of dif-ferent passivated contact layers were tested and characterized as shown in Figure3. Both a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) and a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layers with the thicknesses of a- Si:H 46 nm and nc- SiOx:H 510 nm have the lowest J0 values of about 2 fA/cm2, shown in Figure3A. It can explain why SHJ cell has a high Voc, whereas the P- doped n++ and n+ layers with the sheet resistances of 135 and 230 Ω/sq correspondingly have the highest J0 val-ues of about 18 and 60 fA/cm2, respectively, which is consistent with the lowest Voc of PERC solar cell. However, owing to AlOx/SiNx passivation, the B- doped p++ and p+ layers (R,p++ = 75 Ω/sq, R,p+ = 230 Ω/sq) correspondingly have the lower J0 values of about 8 and 25 fA/cm2, respectively, than P doping layers. The J0 values of the SiOx/n+- poly- Si layers with the thickness of 100 nm and the SiOx/n+- poly- Si layers with the thickness of 300 nm were about 4 and 6 fA/cm2, respectively, which is higher than that of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H layer has the best passivation performance.The metallization- induced recombination J0, etal for different layers is shown in Figure3B. The J0,metal values of the P- doped n++ layer, SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer, and a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer were about 500, 75, and 0 fA/cm2, respectively, whereas the J0,metal values of p+ layer on the Al- BSF, B- doped p++ layer, SiOx/p+- poly- Si layer, and a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer were about 400, 250, 75, and 0 fA/cm2, respectively. These values depend on the corrosiveness of the paste and sinter-ing temperature. Owing to ITO layer, it can provide good  FIGURE η    |    Schematic depiction of cell structure for PERC (A), TOPCon (B), and SHJ (C) structure cells. 893 Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, 2024conductivity, and then the corrosion of the paste on the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+/p+) layers can be ignored. Therefore, the J0,metal value is zero, which is consistent with the highest Voc of SHJ solar cell. Meantime, the SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer also can pro-vide a good conductivity, and then the intensity of paste ero-sion on its layer can be controlled. From the above analysis, we should balance the good conductivity and low corrosive-ness of the paste on the metal area as one of the challenging and critical tasks in the PV market.3.2   |   The Specific Contact Resistance (c)The plot of ρc values for different layers is shown in Figure4. The n+ layers, such as P- doped n++ emitter and SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer, have low ρc values with less than 1 mΩ·cm2 owing to high solid solubility P in Si. However, a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer is covered by the low parasitic absorption of ITO, result-ing in low conductivity, and the high ρc is about 3 mΩ·cm2. The B- doped p++ layer with deep junction depth of over 0.6 µm has a low ρc value of about 0.7 mΩ·cm2, owing to deep cor-rosion of the Ag/Al paste [73]. And the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer has the lowest ρc of 0.3 mΩ·cm2, which is attributed to ITO with high carrier concentration. However, p+ layers, such as Al- BSF and SiOx/p+- poly- Si layer, have a high ρc value of about 3 mΩ·cm2, owing to low doping concentration of these layers.3.3   |   SimulationThe PERC structure with the front side of selective P emitter and the rear side of AlOx/SiNx layer, TOPCon structure with the front side of selective B emitter and the rear side of SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer, and SHJ structure with the front side of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer and the rear side of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer were simulated (Voc, FF) using Griddler 2.5, and the total saturation current density in the cell (Jo,total), the Jo on the front non- metallized area (J0,front), and the rear non- metallized area (J0,rear) were calculated using the mea-sured values of Jo and Jo,metal according to Equations(1)(3), respectively. The saturation current density of the bulk mate-rial (Jo,bulk) was estimated to be 5 fA/cm2 for n- type wafer and 20 fA/cm2 for p- type wafer. The Voc and FF values of the cells were calculated from Jo,total and ρc using an ideal one- diode model, and the results are shown in Table2. The SHJ solar cell had the highest Voc of approximately 749 mV, thus obtaining a gain of over 20 and 50 mV compared to TOPCon and PERC cells, respectively, mainly owing to the Jo,total reduction of 10 and 50 fA/cm2, respectively. The TOPCon cell had a low ρc, resulting in a high FF of about 82.2%, followed by SHJ 81.5% without considering the contribution of Voc to FF. Although the n++ layer on PERC cell had a low ρc, we could not obtain a high FF, mainly because of the high ρc of the p+ layer.The J0 loss was used to be discussed in order to understand the effects of passivation performance on the three types of solar cells.

At pres-ent, the main task of TOPCon solar cell is how to reduce the J0 loss of p+ layer, and the possible direction is aimed for the SiOx/p+- poly- Si layer to replace B- doped layer as the emitter. However, SHJ solar cell has almost perfect surface passivation performance.3.4   |   Cell PerformanceThe results of the iVoc values and the effective carrier lifetime of the precursor structure at the excess carrier density of 1 × 1015 cm3 under 1- sun illumination are shown in Figure6. The PERC solar cells did not show a good passivation performance, which exhibited a significantly low iVoc value of about 716 mV. However, the SHJ solar cell exhibited the best passivation performance, a high iVoc value of about 750 mV.  FIGURE     |    (A) Emitter dark saturation current densities in the passivated regions of P- doped n+/n++, B- doped p+/p++, SiOx/n+/p+- poly- Si, a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+/p+) and the passivation sample, and (B) the metallization- induced recombination with metal contacts printed on one side of the P- doped n++, B- doped p++, SiOx/n+/p+- poly- Si, a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+/p+), and the passivation layer with laser ablation samples.

This trend is strong for the effective carrier lifetime at the excess carrier density of 1 × 1015 cm3, and the order of median ef-fective lifetime is the precursor structure of SHJ (2797 µs), TOPCon (1265 µs), and PERC cell (225 µs).The IV parameters of PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ cells are shown in Table3. SHJ has a high Voc of 748 mV, which is the same as the precursor iVoc and the simulated values, which indicated that the metallization- induced recombination can be ignored. Followed by Voc 728 mV of TOPCon cell, it is in-dicated that the metallization- induced recombination caused a decrease in Voc of up to 8 mV, especially in the p+ region. But its Voc value was higher than the simulated one, perhaps owing to un- considering the improvement bulk lifetime of wafer through the high- temperature process [55]. The PERC cell has the lowest Voc value of 696 mV, which has a high de-crease in Voc of up to 20 mV owing to the metallization- induced recombination, which caused the direct contact between the silicon substrate and the metal paste. The order of Jsc value is TOPCon > PERC > SHJ, it is attributed to the parasitic absorp-tion and surface passivation of the film layer. And the order of FF value is SHJ > TOPCon>PERC, which is attributed to the contact resistance and lateral resistance. From the above analysis, the efficiency performance of the cell is in the order of TOPCon > SHJ > PERC.An analysis of the three types of solar cells using SunsVoc measurements is shown in Table4. The SHJ solar cell has a high pEff of 26.2% owing to its high Voc and pFF, followed by 26% of TOPCon and finally 23.9% of PERC without consid-ering the loss of series resistance. This is consistent with the trend of IV parameters. Mainly due to a high Voc of 748 mV in SHJ, it is attributed to a decrease of 8 fA/cm2 in J01 compared with TOPCon and a decrease of 56 fA/cm2 in J01 compared with PERC. And there is a high pFF of 87.7%, indicating that low- temperature screen printing process cannot achieve good conductivity, which will be one of the challenging and critical tasks in SHJ cell. The PERC solar cell also has a high improve-ment in pFF increasing by 2%, indicating that there is a high damage on the passivation layer in high- temperature screen printing process.3.5   |   Failure AnalysisA current loss was used to be discussed in order to understand the effects of the three types of solar cells. The simulated op-tical reflectance was in agreement with the results of the ex-perimental reflection without any adjustments (Figure7A). In order to maintain the passivation performance of the surface, the SHJ solar cell has a large textured structure with high op-tical reflectance. However, considering the high corrosiveness of boron- doped silicon, the textured surface is controlled ac-cording to the low optical reflectance of small textured sur-face. The primary difference of an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for PERC and SHJ/TOPCon solar cells occurred in the long- wavelength region of 6001000 nm, which is mainly at-tributed to the bulk lifetime between p- type and n- type sili-con wafers. The IQE for SHJ cell exhibited a poor response at TABLE η    |    Detailed calculation of Voc and FF using an ideal one- diode model from the measured values of Jo, Jo,metal, and ρc.

Meantime, the IQE for SHJ and TOPCon cells also exhibited a poor response at the wavelength of < 1000 nm, which is at-tributed to the parasitic absorption of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) and SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer.

Here, there are three primary advantages of TOPCon from SHJ solar cell: The one is blue loss, in which the Jsc is in-creased by 0.65 mA/cm2, which is related to the parasitic ab-sorption of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer. The others are ARC reflectance loss and NIR parasitic absorption loss, which can be benefit from low optical reflectance and the low para-sitic absorption of SiOx/n+- poly- Si layer compared to a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) layer. Although the front surface escape loss of TOPCon solar cell is worse than SHJ cell, it is indicated that the surface passivation of the boron doping layer is inferior to that of a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) layer, it is consistent with the result of J0. The PERC solar cell also has three primary ad-vantages compared to SHJ solar cell: blue loss, ARC reflec-tance loss, and NIR parasitic absorption loss. Compared to SHJ/TOPCon solar cell, the chief disadvantage of PERC solar cell is base collection loss, which is mainly attributed to the bulk lifetime of p- type silicon wafer. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that TOPCon solar cell has a good optical performance. And reducing the optical loss is crucial for im-proving the efficiency of SHJ cell.4   |   DiscussionWe have discussed the differences in optics, contact, and pas-sivation performance among the three types of solar cells. We can now compare the carrier selectivity (S10), according to the calculation, which assumes the non- contacted area with perfectly passivated (i.e., J0 = 0) on the hole- selective contacts and electron- selective contacts. S10 values were calculated using the measured values of Jo and ρc, listed in Tables5 and 6 according to Schmidt etal. [31]. The resulting selectivities S10,e and S10,h, the efficiency- maximizing contacting area frac-tion fe,max and fh,max, and the maximum efficiency ηe,max and ηh,max are calculated using Equations(4)/(5), (6)/(7), and (8). Among them, the ηmax(S10) is assuming a 2 Ω·cm n- type c- Si wafer with thickness of 110 µm with Lambertian light trap-ping (Jsc = 43.6 mA/cm2) and intrinsic bulk recombination with a single contact of selectivity S10 [74]. Because of low Jo and ρc values for the electron- selective layers, it cannot find any significant differences in the ηe,max, which is compatible with [31]. However, for the hole- selective layers, the S10,h of Al- BSF layer has the lowest value of ~13.3, and the corresponding ηe,max value is about 27.77%. This corresponds to earlier find-ings that a p- type 21.2%- efficient PERC cell with local screen- printed BSF contacts with Jo = 550 fA/cm2 and ρc = 5 mΩ·cm2 has a high limiting efficiency of 27.6% [31].(4)  J0m0etaJ0 ,   0m = m[ (5)  Jf00pJf ,   f0 − 01 (6)   J0  f0 ,  −=1 (7)  max=  0.6271−1.085+  1.620×106e−S10 0.8891  −1.085  − 1 1.085.cm 2 TABLE     |    IV parameters of PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ cell.

From the data of electron- selective contacts and hole- selective contacts in Tables5 and 6, we calculate the maximum selectivity S10,e&h,max using Equation(9), as shown in Table7.The current PERC solar cell with an efficiency of 23.59% fea-tures an Al- BSF hole- selective layer and a P- diffused n++ electron- selective layer. The corresponding combined selectiv-ity is S10,e&h,max = 13.23 and the limiting efficiency to 27.5%. It is attributed to the industrially feasible path of SiO2/SiNx stacked layers to further enhance the potential of the n+ front emitter and to further decrease the saturation current density by 65 fA/cm and the ρc by 1.5 mΩ·cm2. These data are higher than that of [31], which stated that the S10 value of an n+ contact for PERC is 12, owing to its high J0,e value of 109 fA/cm2 passivated by SiNx and a high contact resistance ρc of 0.26 Ω·cm2 containing resis-tance contributions from the lateral current flow in the emitter and from the c- Si/metal interface.And the current TOPCon solar cell with an efficiency of 25.87% features a B- diffused p++ hole- selective layer and a SiOx- n+- poly- Si electron- selective layer. The corresponding combined selectivity is S10,e&h,max = 14.87 and the limiting effi-ciency to 29.01%, owing to its low ρc value of 0.7 mΩ·cm2 of the B- diffused p++ hole- selective layer, which is lower than that of TOPCon solar cell with SiOx/poly- Si(p+) by chemical oxide/PECVD as hole- selective layer with a high ρc of 8 mΩ·cm2, resulting in S10,e&h,max of 14.2 and the potential efficiency of 28.7% [31].The current mass production solar cell with an efficiency of 25.67% features an a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+) hole- selective layer and an a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+) electron- selective layer. The corre-sponding combined selectivity is S10,e&h,max = 15.67 and the lim-iting efficiency to 29.14%. However, the SHJ solar cell features an a- Si:H(i)/a- SiH(p) hole- selective layer and an a- Si:H(i)/a- SiH(n) electron- selective layer, which have a high ρc value of 0.4 and 0.1 Ω·cm2, respectively [31]. This points to the reason why the a- Si:H(i)/a- Si:H contacts offer a lower S10,e&h,max value of 13.2 and the lower efficiency potential of 27.5% than the a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H layers [31].Though we calculated the optimum actual fraction of cells with the above n- type Si wafer and the hole contact, as well as the electron contact, the maximum efficiency ηb,e,h,max of PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ solar cells were 26.8%, 27.98%, and 28.12%, respectively. The maximum efficiency with metal shading (ηb,e,h,m,max) were calculated by using Equation(10), as shown in Table7.where Jsc is about 43.6 mA/cm2, A denotes the current loss value ratio of approximately 0.44 mA/cm2/% under 1% contacting area on the front surface of solar cell according to Griddler simula-tion calculations, and ffront represents the contacting area frac-tion on the front side of solar cell.Using Equation(10), the ηb,e,h,m,max of PERC solar cell had gone down to 26.42%. Similarly, the ηb,e,h,m,max of TOPCon cell was 27.62%; however, the ηb,e,h,m,max of SHJ cell decreased to 26.91% owing to the high front contacting area fraction. The next- generation product is back- contact (BC) structure without metal shading. This allows for good passivation on the front surface without contact constraints. Then, we design three types of BC structure cells, which can achieve mass production, including hybrid passivated back- contact (HPBC), TOPCon (8) ρ η J0 0to0alot0o m lta00t0llta0 e  l lta0  (9) , [=({0p1 × J × f , [ × f , (0 + (10) 0,−1−(−0−0p  J 1 = + f p  (0 ,−1−(−0−0p TABLE y    |    The S10,e, fe,max, and ηe,max on electron- selective contacts.

The ef-ficiency of ηb,e,h,m,max was in the order of HBC (28.12%) > TBC (27.99%) > HPBC (26.96%). From the above analysis, we con-clude that by exploiting its high potential with large- scale pro-duction, a close to perfect passivation of the non- contact area, the wide process window, and low cost are required. And it will be the next major challenge for transferring these new concepts to industrial solar cell production.5   |   ConclusionsWe have studied the passivation performance, electrical perfor-mance, and optical performance of the solar cells with differ-ent passivated contact layers. The main conclusions were made as follows: The passivated contact layers including a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(n+), a- Si:H/nc- SiOx:H(p+), SiOx/n+- poly- Si, and SiOx/n+- poly- Si layers have the low J0 < 6 fA/cm2, the low J0,metal < 100 fA/cm2, and the low ρc ≤ 3 mΩ.cm2, whereas the P- doped n++, the B- doped p++, and Al- BSF layer had a high J0 ≥ 25 fA/cm2 and TABLE     |    Combined selectivity S10,e&h, contact area fraction fe,max of electron- selective layer, contact area fraction fh,max of hole- selective layer, and maximum efficiency ηe,h,max, ηe,max, and ηb,e,h,m,max, are listed for all contact combinations of Tables5 and 6.

The SHJ cell has the highest passivation performance with a high Voc of 748 mV due to a lowest J01 of about 14 fA/cm2, but worst optical performance owing to the parasitic absorption of a- Si:H layer. A 728 mV of TOPCon cell was obtained owing to the low J01 of SiOx- n+- poly- Si layer and good optical performance. The PERC cell has the lowest Voc of 696 mV, which has a high decrease in Voc of up to 20 mV owing to the metallization- induced recombination, which caused the direct contact between the silicon substrate and the metal paste. From the above analysis, the disadvantage of PERC solar cell is base collection loss. The increasing FF and Jsc val-ues are the challenging and critical tasks in SHJ cell. And the p+ layer recombination is one of the critical tasks in TOPCon cell.Through the S10 simulation, the PERC solar cell limits the ef-ficiency to 26.42%, TOPCon 27.62%, and SHJ 26.91%. In the next- generation product BC structure, the order efficiency ηb,e,h,m,max was followed in the order of HBC (28.12%) > TBC (27.99%) > HPBC (26.96%). From the perspective of limiting effi-ciency, TOPCon structure with high compatibility is suitable for bifacial BC solar cells, whereas SHJ structure with the parasitic absorption of a- Si:H layer and high contact resistivity is only suitable for BC solar cell. In conclusion, by exploiting its high po-tential with large- scale production, a close to perfect passivation of the non- contact area, the wide process window, and low cost are required. And transferring these new concepts to industrial solar cell production will be the next major challenge.Author ContributionsQinqin Wang: data curation, formal analysis, investigation, method-ology, resources, software, writing  original draft, writing  review and editing, supervision.

This study examines the impact of various process parameter - s—including sintering temperature, laser power, and reverse voltage—within the LECO process on the metallization-induced recombination current density associated with metal contact (denoted as J 0 , metal ), contact resistivity (represented as   c ), and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. On the basis of the experiment, COMSOL simulations were introduced to model the changes in charge carrier dynamics during LECO. The influence of laser power and reverse voltage on the front surface electron concentration was systematically investigated and confirmed. The findings indicated that appropriately reducing the sintering temperature can significantly decrease metallization recombination. At the same time, the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) showed a negative cor - relation with both the laser energy and reverse voltage. Conversely, the fill factor (FF) and contact resistivity (  c ) positively correlated with these factors. Data from   c  and I-V measurements demonstrated that adequate laser energy is crucial for achieving sufficient carrier concentrations, which is necessary for minimizing   c . However, excessively high laser energy may harm the passivation layer. Simulation analysis confirmed that the laser in the LECO process generates electron-hole pairs, while the reverse voltage separates the electrons and holes. We implemented the LECO process utilizing a sintering temperature of 790  ◦ C, laser power of 18 W, and a reverse voltage of 16 V to enhance the maximum efficiency. (E ff ) of 25.97 %, corresponding to a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of 42.05 mA/cm 2 , a V oc  of 731.5 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 84.42 %. The findings presented herein provide valuable insights that will inform the subsequent investigation of novel cell structures. 1.Introduction In recent years, n-TOPCon solar cells have garnered considerable attention within the photovoltaic cells industry. The report anticipates that they may account for as much as 53 % of the market share by 2025 [ 1 ]. n-TOPCon solar cells stand out because they feature a unique ul - trathin silicon oxide (SiO x ) layer paired with n + -polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si). This layer is applied to the rear side, utilizing the excellent interface chemical passivation provided by SiO x  (usually measured at 1–2 nm), combined with the field-effect passivation of heavily doped poly-Si layers [ 2 , 3 ]. This design helps to achieve a low recombination current density (J 0 ) and reduced contact resistivity (  c ) [ 4–8 ]. However, the conversion efficiency of these mass-production cells is limited to 25.8 %. This interesting phenomenon mainly happens because of carrier recombination between the front metal contact and the emitter, and it can significantly influence overall performance [ 9 ]. The laboratory ef - ficiency of n-TOPCon solar cells has reached a remarkable level of 26.58 % [ 10 ]. Utilizing the laser-doping technique effectively minimizes contact recombination losses, leading to a significant boost in efficiency [ 11 ]. The n-TOPCon solar cell is engineered with two fundamental  * Corresponding author. ** Corresponding author. E-mail addresses:  wangqinqin@yzu.edu.cn (Q. Wang),  dingjn@yzu.edu.cn (J. Ding).

The front side features a boron-doped p +layer, which is characterized by a predominant presence of holes, acting as the majority carriers where holes represent the absence of electrons, facilitating the flow of electric current when the cell is engaged in energy conversion. Conversely, the rear side of the cell comprises a phosphorus-doped n-region. This layer is imperative as it provides the electrons essential for the oxidation-reduction reactions involving silver (Ag) at the cell’s elec - trode. These electrochemical reactions are pivotal to the cell’s effi - ciency. Nonetheless, a critical challenge arises from the interaction between these two layers. Efficient charge carrier transport necessitates electrons from the n-region to establish robust contact with the p-region. However, empirical observations indicate that inadequate contact often occurs at the interface between the p-region and n-region. Such insuf - ficient connectivity can lead to performance inefficiencies, ultimately compromising the solar cell’s effectiveness in capturing and converting solar energy into useable electrical power. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between these regions is essential for advancing solar cell technology and enhancing performance metrics [ 12 ]. To address this challenge, aluminum was added to the paste formulation, while the glass etching passivation layer was utilized to create conductive channels. This process results in the formation of silver-aluminum spikes, which enhance direct contact and significantly improve the electrical connection in the p + region of the TOPCon cell [ 13 ]. However, this method inherently increases the metallization-induced recombination current density (J 0,metal ) on the p + layer. The flow properties and characteristics of aluminum limit the silver-aluminum paste’s ability to establish optimal contact in all etched areas after applying the passivation layer etching. This results in void formation, causing notable degradation of the passivation layer. These issues collectively led to a decrease in the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of the cell, while the J 0,metal  on the front side remains high, approximately 400 fA/cm 2  [ 14 ]. In contrast, the J 0,metal  on the rear side of the TOPCon structure is relatively lower, ranging from 50 to 100 fA/cm 2  [ 15 ]. There are two methods to minimize the metallization current density on the p + region. The preliminary methodology entails the utilization of selective emitters (SE), comprising lightly doped emitters situated within the passivation region and highly doped emitters positioned beneath the metal contact. It can diminish the J 0,metal  and   c , and enhance FF and V oc . At present, the J 0,metal  can be reduced to 213 fA/cm 2  [ 9 ]. A widely used technique is laser doping, which promotes the movement of boron from Borosilicate Glass (BSG) into the lightly doped region, thereby establishing heavily doped regions. However, imple - menting laser doping requires a large amount of laser energy, and both excessive and insufficient energy can adversely affect the subsequent processing of the solar cell [ 15 ]. The second approach requires the preparation of a double-sided polycrystalline silicon cell featuring a positive p + -poly-Si layer. A major challenge associated with p + -poly-Si is its relatively low surface passivation capability, with J 0  values exceeding 10 fA/cm 2  [ 16–23 ]. Furthermore, the compatibility of this material with metallization processes is constrained [ 24 ]. A novel sintering technology referred to as Laser Enhanced Contact Optimization (LECO) has been developed to mitigate recombination induced by metallization. The fundamental principle underlying LECO technology entails the utilization of continuous infrared laser irradiation on cells, consequently generating a substantial number of photo- generated charge carriers. At the same time, a reverse voltage of 10–20 V is used to guide the flow of charge carriers [ 25 ], ultimately promoting the optimization of contacts. This method produces a sig - nificant current via small contacts positioned at the apex of the cell pyramid [ 26 ], causing ignition at the corresponding positions and pro - moting the interdiffusion of the silver and silicon. This interaction significantly reduces the   c  between the metal and the semiconductor [ 27 ]. Initially, LECO technology was applied to repair cells with poor sintering, which was implemented in the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), resulting in an increase in V oc  by approximately 7 mV and an enhancement in fill factor (FF) by about 0.4 %, ultimately contributing to an overall efficiency increase of approximately 0.38 % [ 28 ]. Following the development of LECO-tailored pastes, this technology was swiftly implemented in the p + -region of n-TOPCon cells [ 30 ], which can lead to a decrease in J 0,metal  [ 31 ]. Although the general principles of the LECO process have been discussed previously, as shown in  Table 1 , there has been no in-depth study on the influence of LECO process parameters on TOPCon solar cells. Therefore, this study focuses on the effects of LECO process parameters, including laser power, reverse voltage and sintering temperature, concerning their influences on   c , the implied open circuit voltage (iV oc ), the dark saturation current density, pseudo fill factor (pFF) and the I–V parameters of solar cells, i.e., efficiency (E ff ), open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current (J sc ), series resistance (R s ), fill factor (FF). Although the heat produced during the LECO pro - cess has been simulated in earlier research [ 26 ], the crucial element of  Table 1 Reviews on the research on the LECO process for solar cells.

In order to clarify the im - plications of these parameters, we built a comprehensive model of a solar cell, simulated various laser power and reverse voltage circum - stances, and compared the simulation findings with experimental measurements. 2.Materials and methods A n-type industrial-grade TOPCon solar cell featuring 18 busbars was used, as shown in  Fig. 1 . The front side of the cell was boron (B) diffused emitter with sheet resistance of R ,p+ =230 /sq. The rear side struc - ture was a SiO x  layer (1.4 ±0.2 nm) and a P-doped poly-Si (n + -poly-Si) layer (100 ±20 nm). Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), a 3 nm layer of Al 2 O 3  was deposited on the front side of the cell. Next, a passivation layer of 80 nm silicon nitride (SiN x ) was deposited on both sides of the cell using the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. 2.1.Printing and sintering of metallic paste Metallization is accomplished by screen printing and sintering of both standard and LECO-tailored metallic pastes (TOPCon front LECO finger paste model RX2902, rear finger paste model RX2802C, bifacial busbar paste model RX2702) using an H-pattern grid design on both sides of the wafers. The sintering process was performed at varying peak sintering temperatures (760  ◦ C, 790  ◦ C, and 820  ◦ C). 2.2.Laser-enhanced contact optimization The front side was subjected to full-face laser scanning using an infrared laser (	 =1064 nm, f =200 kHz, size =100   m ×100   m). The LECO process has been conducted at varying laser powers (18 W, 20 W, and 22 W) to investigate the effects of laser power. Additionally, the influence of different reverse voltages (15 V, 16 V, 17 V, and 18 V) and a constant power level (24 W) on the performance of n-TOPCon cells was assessed, ensuring compatibility with the LECO-tailored pastes. 2.3.Characterization The microstructure of the cross-section of each finished cell, sub - jected to both conventional and LECO sintering, was characterized using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, JEMF200). At the same time, the elemental composition was analyzed with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscope (FESEM-EDS, Regulus8230). The implied open circuit voltage (iV oc ) values of the samples were determined using the quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) method (Transient Mode) under 1-sun illumination using a Sinton WCT- 120 (@1 ×10 15  atoms/cm 3 ) lifetime tester. The   c  samples were tested using the transfer-length-method (TLM- STD Millennial Solar, Suzhou, Jiangsu China). The dark saturation current density (J 01 , J 02 ) and pseudo fill factor (pFF) values for the solar cells were tested using the Suns-V oc  system (WCT-120 Sinton, Boulder, CO, USA). The open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current (J sc ), series resistance (R s ), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (E ff ) of cells were measured by an I-V tester under 1-sun illumination (AM 1.5). 2.4.Simulation Simulations were conducted to model the concentrations of electrons and holes within the cell, aiming to investigate the roles of laser power and reverse voltage in the LECO process. The COMSOL Multiphysics simulation of semiconductors and electromagnetic waves is focused on, with particular attention being given to the interaction between these phenomena in the context of solar energy. A brief overview of the optical and electrical components involved is provided. The underlying physics of optical and electrical simulations has been extensively documented in the literature [ 32 , 33 ]. Additional formulations related to laser in - teractions are introduced, including the peak electric field E 0 , the inci - dent laser electric field E inc , and the carrier generation rate G. These parameters are recognized as essential for understanding light absorp - tion and carrier dynamics in semiconductor materials under solar irradiation.

The model consisted of a 130   m thick cell, with a bulk silicon phosphorus doping concentration of 1.3 ×10 16  cm �3  and a boron doping concentration of 7 ×10 18  cm �3  on the front surface, featuring a junction depth of 0.6   m. The variation of electron and hole concentrations at the front surface was first simulated under different reverse voltages (0V, 4V, 8V, 12V, 16V). Examining the changes in the curves, the electron and hole con - centrations are primarily concentrated within the 0–2.5   m range on the front surface of the cell. For the laser simulation, we modeled a silicon substrate with a thickness of 2.5   m, maintaining the phosphorus doping concentration at 1.3 ×10 16  cm �3  and excluding boron doping on the front surface. 3.Results and discussion The cells processed with normal sintering exhibited significant damage at the tips of the pyramids on the front surface, with distinct corrosion pits observed, as shown in  Fig. 2 (a). In contrast, the LECO- treated sample, which utilized aluminum-free silver paste for printing the gridlines, displayed no visible corrosion on the pyramids. It revealed the presence of a distinct glass layer that facilitates current tunneling and found large quantities of silver colloids in it, as illustrated in  Fig. 2 Fig. 1.n-TOPCon solar cell structure and LECO process.

Q. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    within the glass layer. In the LECO process, current transmission occurs through two primary mechanisms: (1) Direct Transmission via Silver- Silicon Contact: Dissolved Ag + ions are transported through the molten glass layer to the emitter surface. Upon reaching the silicon surface, they undergo an electrochemical redox reaction, depositing as Ag crystallites. This forms a direct silver-silicon contact at the top of the pyramid, enabling the hole current (h + ) to flow directly through this interface. (2) Tunneling through Metal Precipitates in the Glass Layer: During the cool-down phase, the molten glass layer becomes supersat - urated with Ag + ions, leading to the precipitation of Ag colloids within the interfacial glass layer. These localized Ag-rich regions form a network of nano-silver colloids interconnected by the silver finger. The hole current (h + ) primarily flows through these metal precipitates via the tunneling effect (indicated by the dotted arrow). This mechanism enhances the passivation performance of the glass layer at the contact interface. 3.1.Influence of sintering temperature on contact LECO (laser enhanced contact optimization), the main process is: 1) When printing the front grid line, the use of pure silver paste, due to the special treatment of the paste, reduce the corrosion capacity of the glass material, so the damage to the passivation layer is low; 2) rapid sintering at a lower temperature, further reduce the damage to the passivation layer; 3) laser and reverse voltage for secondary phase secondary sin - tering, to complete the silver silicon mutual diffusion, so as to optimize the contact. To achieve this performance during high-temperature sin - tering, it is essential to lower the sintering temperature. To confirm the effect of LECO process, we added a baseline group (BL) to the sintering temperature experiment. BL paste uses silver powder containing 2.1 % aluminum, and 90 % of the glass frit is Pb; LECO paste uses sterling silver powder, and the Pb content is reduced to 60 %. The initial sintering temperature was set at 820  ◦ C (same as the BL), followed by reductions to 790  ◦ C and 760  ◦ C. Then the experimental group was subjected to LECO treatment (20V reverse voltage, 18W power laser irradiation). The I-V characteristics were evaluated, and the results are summarized in  Table 2 . The efficiency of the BL group is 0.26 % lower, primarily due to a 3.6 mV decrease in V oc  and a 0.26 % reduction in FF. This is attributed to the reduced damage of the paste to the passivation layer and the enhanced contact performance resulting from the silver-silicon contact formed by diffusion. Additionally, the current is 0.09 mA/cm 2  lower, mainly because of the reduced line width. The highest efficiency was recorded at 790  ◦ C, with a 1.4 mV higher V oc  compared to 820  ◦ C, and a 0.2 % higher FF than at 760  ◦ C. These data suggest that optimizing the sintering temperature involves balancing V oc  and FF, minimizing corrosion of the passivation layer, and enhancing contact quality. The results indicate that both   c  and V oc  increase with decreasing sintering temperature, as shown in  Fig. 3 . This observation supports the hypoth - esis that lowering the sintering temperature reduces corrosion of the passivation layer, albeit at the expense of contact performance. Furthermore, the J 01  increases with higher sintering temperatures, suggesting that elevated sintering temperatures enhance interfacial recombination, which may contribute to the observed decrease in V oc . At 760  ◦ C,   c  shows a marked difference compared to 790  ◦ C and 820  ◦ C, indicating insufficient corrosion of the SiN x  layer by the glass in the paste. Consequently, the reduced silver particle density at the pyramid tips may hinder the formation of an optimal contact. The metal satura - tion current density (J 0,metal ) was calculated according to Equation (1):  J 0⎭1 =Θ(1�f metal )*J 0⎭pass +f metal *J 0⎭metal Λ(front)+J 0⎭bulk +Θ(1�f metal )*J 0⎭pass +f metal *J 0⎭metal Λ(rear)(1)  In the equation, J 01  means junction region recombination current density, J 0,pass  represents the recombination current within the passiv - ation region, f metal  indicates the fraction of the metallization area, J 0,metal  corresponds to the recombination associated with metallization, and J 0, bulk  refers to recombination in the bulk. The findings on metallization recombination at different sintering temperatures are shown in  Fig. 3 (e). At 820  ◦ C, J 0,metal  was 256 fA/cm 2 . A decrease in sintering temperature to 790  ◦ C and 760  ◦ C resulted in a reduction of J 0,metal  by approximately 200 fA/cm 2 . This suggests that lowering the sintering temperature re - duces glass corrosion on the passivation layer, thereby enhancing the protective properties of the passivation layer for the metallization area. Furthermore, the impact of further temperature reduction on mitigating glass corrosion becomes less pronounced, with the remaining metalli - zation composite primarily originating from silver-silicon interdiffusion induced by high currents generated during the induction process. The I- V data showed minimal variations at different sintering temperatures, indicating that although changes in sintering temperature affect the formation of contacts within the paste, the contacts formed through the LECO process predominantly rely on the tunneling action of silver col - loids within the glass layer for current collection. Therefore, sintering temperatures within the range of 760  ◦ C–820  ◦ C have minimal impact on the electrical properties. 3.2.Influence of LECO process on n-TOPCon solar cell 3.2.1.The laser power The effects of laser power on the textured surface were investigated,  Fig. 4.(a) iV oc , (b) J 0  and (c) Lifetime before and after laser irradiation.

Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    as shown in  Fig. S1 . A comparative analysis of textured surfaces sub - jected to three different laser power levels revealed no significant changes, suggesting that direct laser irradiation does not cause sub - stantial damage to the cells. To further validate this observation, a semi- finished product was subjected to laser irradiation, as depicted in  Fig. 4 . Remarkably, the minority carrier lifetime, implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ), and recombination current density (J 0 ) exhibited significant im - provements following laser treatment. These results indicate that laser irradiation activates a considerable number of previously inactive car - riers, thereby increasing the minority carrier concentration and enhancing the minority carrier lifetime within the cell. The I-V characteristics of n-TOPCon cells are summarized in  Table 3 , with the corresponding trend illustrated in  Fig. 5 (a). When the laser was not applied, the solar cell cannot form effective contact, resulting in extremely low FF. The maximum cell efficiency was achieved at laser powers of 18 W and 20 W. At laser powers below 22 W, the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) exhibited minimal variation, decreasing by only 1 mV. This minor decrease is attributed to degradation of the surface passivation layer during the LECO process. However, increasing the laser power to 24 W caused an 8 mV reduction in V oc , while the FF remained un - changed. Previous SEM analyses confirmed that laser treatment does not directly degrade cell performance, indicating that the V oc  reduction is not due to damage to the passivation layer. As shown in  Fig. 5 , Suns-V oc  measurements revealed a significant increase in J 01  at 24 W laser power,  Fig. 5.(a) I-V data, (b) V oc , (c) J 0,1 , (d)   c  and (e) measured current at different laser power. Q. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    attributed to enhanced recombination at the metallized grid-line after laser treatment. This behavior likely arises because higher laser power generates more charge carriers, increasing current during the LECO process. The elevated current intensifies damage at the pyramid tips, enlarging the direct contact area between silver and silicon, and thereby increasing J 0,metal , contributing to the observed V oc  reduction.  Fig. 5 (d) shows that   c  decreased from 1.4 m cm 2  to 1.1 m cm 2  as laser power increased from 18 W to 22 W. Simultaneously, FF exhibited an upward trend, indicating improved contact quality with increasing laser power during the LECO process. However, this improvement in contact quality does not fully compensate for the damage in the metallized region,  Table 4 Detailed I-V data under different reverse voltages.

Q. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    leading to a decrease in E ff . These findings demonstrate that laser power significantly affects V oc  during the LECO process due to complex recombination effects in the metallized region. Furthermore, laser power influences FF by generating the necessary charge carriers for current collection. However, within a certain range, laser power has a limited effect on carrier excitation, resulting in minor changes in both FF and   c . Current measurements during the LECO process revealed that at 18 W laser power, the current was 2.5 A, more than 0.5 A lower than at higher power levels, suggesting that reduced laser power limits charge carrier generation. 3.2.2.The reverse voltage The reverse voltage in the LECO process plays a critical role by inducing reverse charge carrier movement during laser irradiation, thereby promoting current flow through regions with high contact resistance that have been slightly corroded by the paste. This process generates localized heating, which optimizes the contact. The I-V data are summarized in  Table 4 . When the reverse voltage was not applied, the solar cell also cannot form effective contact, just like when the laser is not applied, which proves that both laser and reverse voltage are indispensable in LECO process. Notably, an increase in reverse voltage results in a decrease in V oc  of approximately 1 mV, while the FF increases by 0.1 %. The short-circuit current density (J sc ) remains unchanged. As laser energy increases, no significant degradation in electrical charac - teristics is observed, likely because the reverse voltage promotes direc - tional charge carrier movement. Unless the voltage is insufficient to drive carriers into the contact region, its impact on contact formation is minimal. Electrical performance trends, presented in  Fig. 6 (a), indicate that a reverse voltage of 15 V results in a low FF. However, as the reverse voltage increases, FF rises to a plateau, consistent with theoretical ex - pectations. This confirms the critical role of reverse voltage in the process. Suns-V oc  results ( Fig. 6 (b) and (c)) reveal minimal impact from reverse voltage variations; both V oc  and J 01  fluctuate only slightly, by 1 mV and 1 mA/cm 2 , respectively, demonstrating that reverse voltage has a negligible effect on cell performance. As shown in  Fig. 6 (d),   c  significantly decreases from 3.4 m cm 2  to 1.3 m cm 2  as the reverse voltage increases. However, once the voltage reaches 16 V,   c  plateaus, consistent with FF trends, suggesting that reverse voltage only needs to surpass a specific threshold to achieve optimal contact formation. Further increases yield diminishing returns. Based on contact resistivity and Suns-V oc  results, the reverse voltage primarily affects contact for - mation in the LECO process, with minimal impact on V oc . This is attributed to damage at the pyramid tips of the passivation layer in contact with the metal, leading to only minor changes in V oc . Addi - tionally, as shown in  Fig. 6 (e), the measured current increases with reverse voltage, supporting the observed reduction in contact resistivity. The I-V data for cells subjected to varying reverse voltages and laser powers are presented as 3D plots in  Fig. 7 .  Fig. 7 (a) illustrates the relationship between E ff , reverse voltage, and laser power. It is evident that laser power strongly influences cell efficiency, with trends in V oc  and J sc  mirroring those of efficiency. However, excessive laser power results in a rapid decline in efficiency. In contrast, the FF exhibits an upward trend with increasing reverse voltage and laser power. Once either parameter reaches a sufficiently high value, FF stabilizes within a higher range, suggesting that the enhancement of FF by the LECO pro - cess approaches its practical limit under these conditions. 3.3.COMSOL simulation Results of different reverse voltage simulations, which show con - centration variations with cell depth, are presented in  Fig. 8 (a)–(b). As the reverse voltage escalates, the concentration of electrons diminishes  Fig. 7.(a) E ff , (b) V oc , (c) J sc  and (d) FF, as a function of the laser power and the reverse voltage of LECO process. Q. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    within the depth range of 0.6–2   m. Beyond a depth of 2   m, the electron concentration returns to its standard level ( Fig. 8 (a)). In a similar manner, the concentration of holes is maintained at standard levels to a depth of 0.6   m (see  Fig. 8 (b)). However, when a reverse voltage is applied, the hole concentration decreases with increasing voltage, exhibiting a two-order-of-magnitude difference compared to the case without reverse voltage. The observed changes in electron and hole concentrations, combined with  Figs. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Material, demonstrate that reverse voltage induces movement of both electrons and holes. The findings regarding the varying concentrations of electrons and holes, which are predominantly situated within the 0–2.5   m range on the anterior surface, have been illustrated in  Fig. 8 (c)–(d).  Fig. 8 (d) shows the hole concentration in phosphorus-doped wafers. Initially, without laser treatment, the hole concentration is 1 ×10 7 cm �3 . How - ever, the hole concentration increases significantly after laser treatment, reaching a peak of 8 ×10 12 cm �3 . The changes in electron and hole concentrations following laser treatment exhibit similar trends. This observation, combined with supplementary materials in  Figs. S4 and S5 , indicates that the electron concentration increases linearly with the rise in laser power. 4.Conclusions This study systematically analyzes the influence of various process parameters on the LECO process. Initially, the influence of the sintering temperature was assessed, thereby highlighting its substantial effect on glass corrosion, which has the potential to undermine the passivation layer. Optimal cell efficiency was achieved at a peak sintering temper - ature of approximately 790  ◦ C. Reducing the sintering temperature further resulted in decreased glass corrosion, accompanied by a 0.2 % reduction in FF and an increase in   c  of 0.9 m cm 2 . Conversely, higher sintering temperatures intensified glass corrosion, leading to a rapid increase in J 0,metal , from 182 fA/cm 2  to 256 fA/cm 2 . The results also highlighted the role of reverse voltage in directing charge carrier movement. Once a threshold voltage is reached, further adjustments have minimal effect on contact formation. However, insufficient reverse voltage fails to guide carriers effectively, reducing FF by approximately 0.1 %. In contrast, variations in reverse voltage had negligible effects on V oc  and J sc , as reverse voltage primarily influences current magnitude during the LECO process, significantly impacting contact quality. Laser treatment enhanced the minority carrier lifetime without damaging the passivation layer. Increasing laser power during the LECO process improved contact optimization, though excessive power generated sur - plus carriers and reverse currents, potentially damaging the passivation layer. Hence, precise laser power is crucial to ensure effective current formation without adverse effects. COMSOL simulations further clarified the roles of reverse voltage and laser treatment in the LECO process. Reverse voltage facilitated the separation of electrons and holes, while laser treatment generated excess charge carriers that promoted current formation. The findings confirm the significant impact of LECO parameters on the I-V performance of TOPCon cells. Future optimizations should consider various cell struc - tures to facilitate improved contact formation and enhanced device efficiency.

According to the forecast of the ITRPV 2015, technology with cell efficiency greater than 24% for large scale production should use n-type material, while market  share of n-type solar cell will be around 40% in 2024. Especially, n-type bifacial solar cell with PERT structure shows higher performance because of rear total diffused and good double-sides passivation with low surface  recombination rate. To realize PERT structure, quite a lot technological platforms can be selected such as diffusion  [3], implantation [1,3], CVD deposition [4], or advanced metallization technologies. More importantly, PERT can be easily developed from traditional p-type cells without vast gap. In this work, we developed PERT cell based on boron paste spin coating can be combined with POCl3 diffusion, industrial screen printing was applied as the metallization method. 2. Experiments The n-type PERT solar cells were fabricated on 6 inch CZ phosphorous-doped silicon wafers with resistivity of 0.8–4 ��·cm and thickness of 180 �˛m. The PERT solar cells were fabricated in industrial scale tools. The main process flow is shown in Fig.1. Both sides random pyramids, front side spin-on boron paste and baking, boron diffusion in a quartz furnace formed homogeneous junction. Besides, the BSF was fabricated in the industrial POCl3 diffusion system. Thermal Oxide silicon and direct PECVD silicon nitride were deposited on both sides as stack passivation layers, both sides metallization is H-pattern fingers by screen printing.    Fig.1. Solar cell structure (L) and Process flow (R) The modules were encapsulated by EVA with the nPERT solar cells mentioned above. In the process, three-part non-shading junction box and no metal frame structure were applied, while front 2.5 mm antireflection glass and rear 2.5 mm float glass were adopted. The system was set up with four 270 W bifacial panels in series with MPPT and dynamic loading in outdoor testing basement in Suzhou, China. The same mono-panels were mounted as reference. The installation parameters were 37° tilt angle face south, 15 cm height and no backside shield. The system with changeable 8 m2 background, such as sand, white foam (as snow) and raw grass was applied. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Solar cell  Liquid boron ink was spun on the surface homogeneously and baked immediately at 150�� for about 1min. The emitter and BSF was formed in quartz furnace step by step, while front and rear contact with Ag-Al and Ag paste respectively. Solar cells were measured by commercial solar simulator under STC 25�� @1sun. Table 1 shows the optimized 50pcs batch of solar cell results. The mean front efficiency is 20%, while it is 18.21% for the rear average efficiency, which means an average bifaciality greater than 90%. The best front  efficiency is 20.2%. Due to the single side diffusion, no more diffusion etching for back side was required. Furthermore, better efficiency should be obtained by optimizing doping profiles for B and P respectively to suit the surface passivation.  752   Qingzhu Wei et al.  /  Energy Procedia   92  ( 2016 )  750  754 Table 1.

Outdoor experiments The output collections were conducted during the same period with changeable background of raw grass, sand and manmade foam for both bifacial and monofacial modules. All the sample modules have been exposed to sunlight for a long time before the installation to get a stable condition. The output was normalized by 1 kW for each group.   Fig. 4. On-site Photo and System Set-up Schematic Diagram The power output comparison is shown in Fig.5. Power gains of different background were almost 7.6% on grass, 15% on sand and 29.2% on snow, which just fit well with other researchers [5, 6] and the simulation. Power gains in the experiment is extremely high for the reflections of half open filed and nearby white building. It is clear that rear side absorption is the main reason for the power gain of the bifacial modules.   Fig. 5. Output gains (Ref 1, Ref 2 and Ref 3: monofacial; under grass, sand, snow: bifacial) 4. Conclusion and outlook Efficiency greater than 20% was obtained on nPERT solar cells by using boron spin-on coating and POCl3 diffusion. Bifacial glass-glass module shows an excellent anti-PID and LID-free performance.

IntroductionOrganicinorganic metal halide perov-skites have shown great potential in  multiple applications, particularly in photovoltaic (PV) devices, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties that  can be obtained by solution processing.[] The bandgap of the perovskite ﬁlm can be  changed easily by modifying its composi-tion.[] Compared to IIIV high bandgap semiconductor materials, the perovskite ﬁlm is low cost and easy to fabricate. This makes perovskite cells a potential candi-date not only for single-junction but also  multi-junction solar cells. Over the past   years, the power conversion eciency of the perovskite solar cell has rapidly increased from .% to .%, which is  over % of its thermodynamic limit.[,] This great progress on single junction  devices has been accompanied by equally impressive achievements on tandem  The tandem cell structure is the most promising solution for the next genera-tion photovoltaic technology to overcome the single-junction ShockleyQue-isser limit. The fabrication of a perovskite/c-Si monolithic tandem device has not yet been demonstrated on a c-Si bottom cell produced from an industrial  production line. Here, a c-Si cell with a tunneling oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) structure produced on a production line as the bottom cell of a tandem device, and a top cell featuring solution-processed perovskite ﬁlms  to form the tandem device are used. The c-Si cell features a rough damage etched, but untextured front surface from the wafering processes. To combat the challenge of rough surfaces, several strategies to avoid shunt paths  across carrier transport layers, absorber layers, and their interfaces are imple-mented. Moreover, the origin of reﬂection loss on this planar structure is investigated and the reﬂection loss is managed to below mAcm−. In addi-tion, the source of the voltage loss from the TOPCon bottom cell is identiﬁed and the device structure is redesigned to be suitable for tandem applications while still using mass production feasible fabrication methods. Overall, .%  eciency is achieved for a monolithic perovskite/c-Si tandem device, with signiﬁcant potential for future improvements. Y. Wu, J. Peng, S. Surve, A. D. Bui, W. Liang, L. Duan, H.

Fol-lowing wafering and damage removal, the wafers have a micro-scale roughness on the surface which poses a challenge for  common solution-processed perovskites; hereafter, we refer to  this surface as damage etched. Chemo-mechanical polishing,  which can reduce the roughness signicantly, is too expen-sive for commercial PV production. The surface roughness following damage etching therefore represents the minimum  roughness that the perovskite fabrication process must be able  to handle. The roughness could be increased further through texturing, which increases the challenge but may also improve the optical properties of the tandem stack.Sahli etal. demonstrated a two-step method to form the perovskite lm conformally on top of a textured silicon surface.  However, a vacuum thermal evaporation step for the deposi- tion of PbI was involved, which could signicantly increase the cost of fabrication, and which may therefore not be suitable for  mass production. Chen etal. and Hou etal. recently reported deposition of ﬁ.m thick perovskite lms using solution processing on top of a sub-micron textured surface (m). It has been shown that thick perovskite lms can fully cover a textured c-Si surface and form a planar perovskite surface on top.[,] However it is challenging to endow such thick lms with high quality over a large area in a reproducible manner, because crystallization starts from the top surface to prevent solvents escaping during lm formation.[] Additionally, the thick lm introduces greater demands on the material qual-itya greater bulk lifetime may be needed to ensure the car-rier diusion length remains sucient for highly ecient cur-rent collection, and to retain a high open-circuit voltage (VOC). Further, for industrial silicon wafers, the roughness is typically  larger than m, and even such thick perovskite lms may not be sucient to ensure the fabrication of shunt path free  tandem devices.To closely partner with established industrial workow, we report an approach to enhance both the eciency and reproduc-ibility of tandem devices on an industrially fabricated, tunnelling oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) c-Si bottom device. The c-Si  cell employs an n-type silicon substrate. Cells based on n-type  substrates generally display higher lifetimes and reduced deg- radation compared to cells based on p-type substrates, and are thus attractive for high eciency devices. This device features a damage-etched (but not textured) top surface. These TOPCon  sub-cells are immediately available by following a standard  wafering and etching process commonly used in industry (Figurea). We fabricate the perovskite sub-cell conformally on the damage-etched front surface to mitigate the negative impacts of rough c-Si substrates, thus preventing shunt paths across carrier transport layers, absorber layers, and their inter-faces in relevance. Moreover, we evaluate the photon harvest in the entire tandem layout with a focus on the optimization of the  front transparent conductive oxide (TCO) to balance the reec- tance and series resistance losses. In addition, we reveal the origin of electrical losses from the TOPCon sub-cell and dem-onstrate rear localized contacts with a mesa structure, which  is feasible for mass production. As a result, a .% eciency  (-cm) was achieved for a monolithic tandem device using an industrially produced bottom c-Si cell with a TOPCon structure.

The industrial wafer surface is generally obtained from the dia-mond wire cutting process when wafering the silicon ingot, followed by a fast alkaline etch to remove the surface damage.  It is not a textured surface, but a rough surface (RMS−m), which makes the subsequent deposition of perovskite ﬁlms challenging. Currently, chemicallymechanically polished wafers are often used for solution deposition of perovskite  absorbers. However, the use of such wafers in commercial  production would dramatically increase the overall fabrication  cost, rendering such devices uneconomic. The comparison of  the reﬂectivity and surface morphology of these three types of wafer surfaces (polished, damaged etched and textured) can be found in Figures S and S (Supporting Information) and  Figurea. Alternatively, vacuum deposition techniques can be  used, which, unfortunately, slows down the throughput and  hence increases fabrication costs. To overcome the challenge of depositing a shunt path-free perovskite top cell on top of the rough surface using a solution-processed perovskite ﬁlm, here  we employed a strategy that takes advantage of the synergetic  eects of the functional layers and interfaces to minimize the shunting probability during device fabrication.The ﬁrst step was the use of a dense hole transport layer. Here we choose physical vapor deposition instead of solution processing to sputter coat a nm thick layer of NiOx as the hole transport layer (HTL) to minimize the likelihood of pin-holes that can result in shunt paths. The sputter-coated ﬁlm forms a dense and conformal layer on top of the rough silicon surface, as shown in Figure S (Supporting Information). How- ever, the eciency of p-i-n devices using NiOx is lower than that using other HTLs such as poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) or  self-assembled molecules (SAMs),[] due to interface recom-bination losses.[] As seen in Figurec, the VOC of the opaque device is relatively low with NiOx as the HTL, with a VOC deﬁcit over mV. In order to reduce recombination losses, here  we insert a thin PTAA or poly(N,N-bis--butylphenyl-N,N-bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) layer to passivate the interface between NiOx and the perovskite ﬁlm. Both polymers show  signiﬁcant VOC enhancement (mV) on the opaque device as shown in Figurec,d, which is consistent with the earlier  reports.[,]We also studied the impact of the molecular weight of the polymers on the devices performance. Interestingly, as shown  in Figurec,d, we found that opaque devices with higher mole-cular weight (Mw) PTAA and polyTPD show signiﬁcantly better consistency of VOC. With a rougher surface for tandem fabrica-tion, a similar result is found on the tandem devices, shown  in Figure S (Supporting Information). In earlier work, it was reported that low Mw polymers tend to form beads, but high Mw polymers tend to form ﬁbers in the solution,[] which may result in better coverage on the rough surface. We carried out  Figure . Confocal microscopy images of the surface morphology of a) damage etched and b) polished silicon surfaces (please note x and y-axes are not on the same scale as the z-axis).

In Figuree,f, we superimposed the CAFM result on top of the AFM morphology result. The white patches on the image are where the CAFM measurement shows high current  (i.e., high conductivity). Figuree shows signicantly more and  larger high current areas than Figuref. Since the polymer lm has signicantly lower conductivity than FTO glass substrates, it suggests that a high Mw polymer gives better surface cov- erage on the rough surface.Secondly, we use the vacuum ash method to ensure con-formal growth of perovskite lms.[,] Unlike the conventional anti-solvent method which introduces non-uniformity over a  large area, the vacuum ash method uses a vacuum to extract the solvent in the wet lm to facilitate nucleation. It is thus a feasible approach for the large area fabrication of perovskite  lms and tandem devices with satisfactory consistency.[] In this work, we further optimized this process for the methylam- monium (MA)-free high band-gap perovskite precursor (see Methods, Supporting Information). From the SEM result in  Figure S (Supporting Information), the high bandgap perov-skite lm with the optimized process was found to be compact and smooth over a large area, and enabled an opaque device  with over % eciency.In addition, the electron transport layer/buer layer of SnOx was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD), wherein a  longer purge time was employed to form a dense layer. The thick-ness per cycle with various purge times is shown in Figure Sa  (Supporting Information). The lm growth follows a quasi-chemical vapor deposition (CVD) mode when the purge time  is decreased, which compromises the lm conformity signi-cantly. Here we maximize the purge time after each pulse with a short pulse time, to ensure the SnOx deposition step is in an ALD mode for better coverage. In Figure Sb (Supporting  Information), the refractive index of the lm with longer purge time is signicantly increased, indicating enhanced lm den-sity. Though we are using a thinner lm (nm) compared with  all other reports using a similar structure,[ﬁ,,,] due to the exceptional conformality, the thin lm shows superior quality  for blocking the sputter damage and minimizing shunt paths. The low thickness is benecial for reducing reection losses, which will be detailed in the next section.. Reﬂectance ManagementLight management is crucial for planar tandem devices to  achieve high current output. We investigated the relationship  between the top transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and the optical and electrical properties of the tandem device using combined optical and device simulation. We evaluated  TCO  materials (ITO, indium zinc oxide (IZO) and indium tungsten  oxide (IWO)) and tested the optical and electrical performance of the sputtered thin lms (Figures S and S, Supporting Infor-mation). We found that for room temperature sputtering, IZO shows superior optical and electrical properties, and this mate- rial was chosen for the top electrode of our tandem devices.As shown in Figurea, the reection loss strongly depends on the thickness of the front IZO layer. When the lm is less than ﬁnm thick, the UV to visible reection loss is mainly  at wavelengths less than ﬁﬁnm, which is insignicant due to  both low photon ux and internal quantum eciency in this  range. When the thickness of the lm increases, the reec-tion peak starts to redshift and an additional reection peak at ﬁﬁnm emerges. We summarize the simulated reection loss,  the IZO parasitic absorption loss, and the total generation of  the tandem device in Figureb along with the sheet resistance (lm thickness). We found the total generation starts to drop rapidly once the sheet resistance drops below ﬁ (thick-ness above ﬁnm).However, reducing the thickness of the TCO layer will increase the sheet resistance of the lm, and hamper the lateral  carrier transport. To quantify the loss, in Figurec, we simu- lated the resistive loss based on the nger pitch width and the  sheet resistance of the front IZO lm for a -cm device (nger width ﬁm, height ﬁﬁnm). As expected, with decreased pitch width and sheet resistance, the resistive loss drops. But as we discussed earlier, this leads to increased reection and absorption losses. Further, a reduced pitch width introduces  more reection loss from the metal ngers. We combined  Figureb,c to nd the sweet spot for minimal power loss due to both optical and electrical limitations. Assuming a VOC of .V and a FF of ﬁ%, we found a sheet resistance of ﬁ, with .mm nger pitch, minimized overall power loss. Con-sidering the similar refractive index of Cﬁ (.@ﬁﬁnm),  ALD deposited SnOx (.@ﬁﬁnm) and the sputtered IZO lm (.ﬁ@ﬁﬁnm), the front reectance loss is determined  by the overall thickness of the top electron transport layer stack and the TCO layer. Hence, it is important to keep the Cﬁ and SnOx layers as thin as possible to leave the IZO lm thick enough for good lateral conductivity while keeping front  reectance low. From the simulation result, the device is not sensitive to the nger pitch due to several reasons. Firstly, evaporated ngers still have limited conductivity since they  are relatively thin compared to the tall ngers produced  by screen printing or electroplating. More importantly, the tandem device has less than half of current density compared with silicon device, and therefore it is signicantly more tol- erant to the resistive loss introduced by the front electrode. As  illustrated in Figured, overall, for a -cm tandem device, the front optoelectrical loss is more sensitive to the thickness of  the TCO layer due to the optical loss. Therefore, for the ease of fabrication, the front metal electrode for tandem device pre-sented in this work is grid free.In addition, we investigated the reection loss due to the recombination layer between two sub-cells. The ITO lm for  the recombination layer does not introduce additional para- sitic absorption losses but impacts total reection loss. This is due to the considerable refractive index mismatch between ITO (.@ﬁﬁnm) and the materials on either side which are  poly:Si (.@ﬁﬁnm) and NiOx (.ﬁ@ﬁﬁnm). To minimize reection loss at this interface, some authors have reported  a recombination layer free design.[,] However, NiOx and n-poly:Si cannot form an ohmic contact.[ﬁ] The alternative is to minimize the thickness of the recombination ITO layer, so that  the reection loss from this interface due to the refractive index mismatch becomes insignicant, as shown in Figure S (Sup-porting Information). Here we reduce the thickness of the ITO Adv.

From the cross-sectional SEM image shown in Figuree, the thermally evaporated MgF lm shows cracks within the lm, which facilitates the penetration of water or oxygen, reducing device lifetime. To form a compact AR layer, we thus deposited an SiO lm using reactive sputtering with a Si target. Dierent from thermal evaporation, ions have signicantly higher kinetic energy when reaching the substrate and form a dense layer.  However, SiO is also hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of  ( for MgF), as shown in Figureg. To combat the issue, we thermally evaporated a thin layer (ﬁnm) of polytetrauoro- ethylene (PTFE)on top of the SiO, which increases the water contact angle to . The cross-section in Figuref shows the  AR lm with an SiO and PTFE stack is dense and continuous. Optically, the SiO and PTFE composite AR layer exhibit neg-ligible absorption with a refractive index comparable to MgF (Figure Sﬁ, Supporting Information). The simulated reection  spectra with both MgF and SiO/PTFE are similar (Figure S, Supporting Information), indicating the SiO/PTFE stack can serve as both a robust barrier layer and an excellent AR coating  for the tandem device.. Design of the TOPCon Bottom CellIn this work, we obtained the silicon bottom cell from an  industrial production line. The cells were fabricated on a  mm size wafer with a TOPCon structure. How-ever, we found that with this device structure, the c-Si device  exhibited a signicantly lower VOC (mV without shadow mask, mV with shadow mask) than expected (implied VOC ﬁmV) under one-sun conditions, as shown in Figurea.To understand the origin of this loss, we developed a D full device simulation in Quokka[] similar to the structure shown in Figurea. The simulated result is listed in Table S (Sup- porting Information), using a silicon sub-cell generation prole in the tandem structure shown in Figure S (Supporting Infor-mation). For full area illumination, we excluded the shading from both the busbar and the shadow mask. For active area  illumination, only the ﬁﬁmm area is illuminated. Finger shading is included for both conditions. From the simulation  Figure . a) Simulated reection spectrum of the tandem device versus variable IZO thickness, b) Integrated losses (reection and IZO parasitic absorption loss) and total carrier generation (perovskitec-Si) from both the perovskite and the c-Si active layers, c) simulated Rs loss for a -cm device due to the front electrode, d) simulated total loss (opticalRs) due to the front electrode.

Moreover, the four edges contribute an additional mV loss to the VOC, which adds up to a total mV VOC drop due to the recombination at the edges of the substrate. To minimize the edge eect, we devel- oped another two structures for the rear contact, namely the localized contact, and localized contact with mesa structure, as shown in Figureb,c, which are designed to primarily conne  the majority carriers (holes) on the rear side to the active area  and prevent recombination at the cell edges.The simulation result of these two structures can be found in Table S (Supporting Information) and Figured. Compared  with the conventional device, the device with localized con- tact structure shows a VOC loss of mV, while the loss with the rear mesa structure is only mV. Interestingly, simula- tion results show a signicantly higher ll factor in the design with the mesa structure when edge recombination is included. The reduction in VOC is mainly from the recombination of the metal on the rear side. When the illumination type is changed  from full area to active area, the carriers generated in the active  region will ow to the dark area due to the carrier concentration gradient and recombine. Therefore, the drop in VOC is lower for the localized contact design. The dierence is further amplied with the inclusion of edge recombination. Comparing the sim-ulation of the localized contact design with and without mesa structure, it is obvious that the rear boron emitter facilitates  the transport of carriers from the active illumination area to  the area in the dark. Hence, the mesa structure can reduce this recombination loss and lower the VOC drop. The mesa structure can also reduce non-ideal recombination, namely Jﬁ from the edge, which is observed from the FF improvement with mesa.We fabricated full tandem devices based on the  dierent rear side designs and compared their performance (Figuree and Figure S, Supporting Information). The device with full area contact shows signicantly lower VOC compared with local-ized contact with or without mesa. Compared with the cell with  localized contact but no mesa, the cell with mesa structure shows a slightly better VOC, but a signicantly better FF, which is in line with the simulation result. The external quantum eciency and VMPP tracking result of the device are shown in Figuref and Figure S (Supporting Information). The best  eciency on a -cm device reaches .% based on the local-ized contact with mesa structure, indicating its eectiveness.. Loss Analysis and OutlookTo improve the eciency of the tandem device in the future,  we analyze the major losses of the tandem device based on the  above conguration. The voltage loss comes mainly from the perovskite device. As seen in Figurea, we fabricated three test structures to evaluate the implied VOC using photolumi-nescence measurements. For quartz/perovskite, the meas-ured implied VOC is .V, which is a ﬁmV voltage decit from its bandgap (.eV), or a ﬁmV decit compared to  its SchockleyQueisser limit. The reason for this large voltage decit in high bandgap mixed cation/halide perovskites may be related to halide or cation segregation and imperfections within  the perovskite absorber.[,] With respect to the interfaces, the voltage loss from the perovskite/hole transport layer interface  is relatively small (ﬁmV) when polyTPD is used. However, the perovskite/Cﬁ interface results in a signicant loss of ﬁmV.[,]The voltage loss from the silicon sub-cell is less sig-nicant, but the rear passivation can still be improved. As  seen in the recombination loss analysis in Figureb, the rear  Figure .

Currently, the rear side of the device is passivated with  an AlO/SiNx stack on the non-contact area, while the contact area is in direct contact with the screen-printed metal ngers.  The latter contributes a signicant portion of the recombination loss here. One way to minimize the loss is to introduce a double sided poly:Si structure, where the front and the rear side of the  cell is contacted by n-poly:Si and p-poly:Si respectively to mini-mize the recombination loss in the contact area.In the previous section, we have achieved the lowest optical loss reported to date for this device conguration through careful light management. We analyze the breakdown of the optical loss in Figurec, wherein the reection loss accounts for most of the optical loss. As shown in Figurea, the most  intensive reection loss with IZO is due to the substantial mis- match of the refractive index between the polyTPD/NiOx/ITO  stack and the c-Si bottom cell as shown in Figure S (Sup-porting Information). In our previous work, we used a homo-junction c-Si as the bottom cell, and a layer of high refractive  index SiNx (n.@ﬁﬁnm) to reduce the mismatch.[] How-ever, this approach cannot be employed when a TOPCon device  is used; in this case, the refractive index matched material must also be electrically conductive. For the tandem device using a heterojunction c-Si cell as the bottom cell, Mazzarella etal.  developed a conductive nc-SiOx:H (n.@ﬁﬁnm) interlayer to minimize the eect of mismatch.[] However, this mate-rial is not suitable for the perovskite top cell used here, which  features a high-temperature fabrication process. Hence, to fur-ther minimize the reection loss for the planar tandem device,  a material with a high refractive index and good temperature  stability, conductivity and infrared transparency is needed.  Another alternative is to use a sub-micrometer textured surface  as front structure to reduce the infrared reection loss.[,]There is also room for improvement in reducing the para-sitic absorption loss. In our device, it is the NiOx that leads to the most signicant parasitic absorption loss. Our results sug- gest lm absorption is related to the deposition conditions, in particular the O/Ar ratio (Figure S, Supporting Information), which signicantly aects lm crystallinity (Figure S, Sup-porting Information). It thus requires further eort to reduce the parasitic absorption loss of NiOx, or to nd a replacement in the future. Cﬁ is responsible for the second biggest parasitic absorption loss in this device. We reduced the thickness of the Cﬁ lm to ﬁnm to minimize the absorption loss. However, further reduction of lm thickness leads to substantial VOC drop (Figure S, Supporting Information), which is likely due  to the insucient hole blocking capability as a result of non-continuous lm coverage. This indicates a more transparent but compatible electron transport material may need to be  developed.. ConclusionIn summary, we systematically investigate strategies to miti- gate the impact of the damage etched, rough silicon surface on  device performance. Further, we investigate the origin of reec-tion losses in a planar structure, and design a bottom cell c-Si for the tandem structure that is based on the TOPCon structure,  but with some modications to improve the performance of the  c-Si cell. We report a facile method to uniformly passivate the micron-scale damage etched rough surface of the industrially fabricated c-Si devices using high molecular weight polyTPD  to largely suppress the interface recombination and enhance  the reproducibility. Together with sputtered NiOx, a vacuum ashed perovskite lm and an ultra-dense lm of ALD depos- ited SnOx, the resulting perovskite/c-Si tandem device is found to display excellent reproducibility. Using ray tracing and device  simulation, the balance between reection loss and resistive loss is optimized to minimize the overall power output loss. An SiO/PTFE AR coating stack is presented to serve as a barrier layer for better stability. We further redesign the structure of  the commercially fabricated c-Si device, incorporating a mesa structure while still using the mass production feasible fabrica-tion methods. As a result, an eciency of .% is obtained.  The methods discussed above could help in the commercializa- tion of low-cost and ecient perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells.Supporting InformationSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.AcknowledgementsThe work was supported by the Australian Government through the  Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

Yet, its relatively poorer reliability compared to Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact (PERC) solar cells puts costly limitations on the module bill of materials that can be used. The use of silver/ aluminum (Ag/Al) paste for front-side metallization is identified as a key factor contributing to the relatively poor reliability of TOPCon modules, particularly at high temperatures and humidity. However, very recently, laser-assisted firing techniques such as laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO) that combine conventional co-firing at relatively low temperatures with a subsequent laser treatment have emerged as an appealing alternative to standard one-step cofiring. The main driver for laser-assisted firing is enabling higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE). This technique permits the application of screen printing pastes with considerably reduced levels of aluminum (Al), or even the complete exclusion of Al. Consequently, the enhancement in PCE values may not only boost PCE, but may also offer benefits in terms of reliability. This study investigates the impact of Jolywood Special Injected Metallization (JSIM) method on the reliability of TOPCon solar cells. Cell level damp heat testing at 85  ◦ C and 85% relative humidity (DH85) with selected impurities reveals a significant improvement for the JSIM solar cells versus the standard baseline TOPCon cells. Baseline cells experienced rapid degradation, with a substantial (~92% rel ) loss in PCE attributed to a significant (~13,000% rel ) increase in series resistance (R s ) when exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl). Conversely, JSIM cells showcased remarkable resilience, displaying only a modest drop in PCE (~3.6% rel ) under similar conditions. This work clearly shows that laser- assisted firing processes such as JSIM also significantly improve the reliability of TOPCon solar cells. This improvement is due to the compatibility of these processes with screen printing pastes that have low or zero Al concentration for the TOPCon front. Consequently, this approach enables using more cost-effective materials for TOPCon modules, thereby reducing the overall cost of solar electricity.    1.Introduction The advent of tunnelling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells has garnered significant attention in pursuing high-efficiency sili - con solar cell technologies over the past decade [1–5]. Recent strides in commercializing TOPCon cells, facilitated by diverse process and tool developments, position this technology as a potential frontrunner in the global photovoltaic market [6–13]. Despite its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with existing passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) production lines, the widespread commercialization of TOPCon modules has raised concerns regarding their reliability [14–19]. Numerous studies have highlighted potential reliability issues faced by TOPCon solar cells and modules under operational conditions, particularly under high humidity and temperature [14,15,20,21]. Damp-heat stress, exemplified by conditions such as the standard DH85 test (85  ◦ C, 85% relative humidity), has been linked to substantial degradation in power output [18,22,23]. Investigations by Sommeling et al. and Iqbal et al. underscore the sensitivity of TOPCon cell front-side contacts to damp-heat conditions, culminating in severe contact issues after pro - longed testing [14,15]. Previous research, including our own, has  *Corresponding author. **Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: yangwg01@jolywood.cn (W. Yang), b.hoex@unsw.edu.au (B. Hoex).

Further exploration has implicated the relatively high Al content of the front contact as a critical factor contributing to the instability observed in TOPCon solar cells, war - ranting urgent optimization efforts [24–27]. Consequently, commercial TOPCon modules are primarily glass-glass (G-G) modules with high-quality encapsulants such as POE (polyolefin elastomers), and edge sealants to ensure that water cannot enter the module. However, this approach results in more expensive and heavier modules, so the industry is keen to address the intrinsic sensitivity of the TOPCon solar cells to allow for the use of cheaper module bill of materials. In recent years, laser-assisted firing has garnered substantial interest as an improved firing technique for silicon solar cells [28–34]. Among these approaches, laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO), which was initially introduced by Mayberry et al. entails applying a highly intense laser pulse locally on the front side of the solar cell under a constant reverse voltage [34]. This leads to a high localized current flow, which substantially reduces the contact resistivity between the semi - conductor and metal electrode in areas where the contact resistance was already relatively low before the process [34–37]. This laser firing method has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing the efficiency of PERC and TOPCon cells by expanding the firing window and preserving sur - face passivation, particularly on lightly doped emitters. Furthermore, laser-assisted firing has facilitated the application of new metallization pastes for manufacturing PERC and TOPCon solar cells at lower firing temperatures, marking a significant advancement in industrial produc - tion lines utilizing TOPCon cells. The integration of laser-assisted firing has enabled the application of silver paste with low or zero aluminum on lightly doped boron emitters in TOPCon cells. Krassowski et al. inves - tigated the reliability of PERC cells with LECO treatment, affirming that it did not compromise the long-term stability of module performance [36,38,39]. However, the evaluation of TOPCon cell and module reli - ability based on the laser-assisted firing process and tailored paste re - mains limited. Given the heightened sensitivity of TOPCon’s front-side contact, evaluating the impact of laser-assisted firing treatment and associated pastes on the long-term stability of TOPCon solar cells and modules, particularly under damp-heat conditions is imperative. In this study, we employed contaminant-induced accelerated DH85 testing to assess industrial TOPCon solar cells using an optimized paste combined with the laser-assisted firing process, contrasting them with baseline TOPCon solar cells all fabricated at an industrial production line. The advantages of stability conferred by laser-assisted firing customized paste were revealed through detailed analysis of the contacts by scanning electron microscopy after accelerated testing. Additionally, glass-backsheet (G-B) modules were fabricated to conduct further long- term reliability testing of both baseline and laser-assisted firing-treated TOPCon solar cells. 2.Experimental details All the TOPCon cells were processed on G10 n-type Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafers (182 mm ×182 mm). Fig. 1 (a) illustrates the structure of the TOPCon cell with selective emitters, while both experimental and control groups utilized TOPCon precursors where the TOPCon contact was made using plasma oxidation & plasma-assisted in situ-doping deposition (POPAID), a physical vapor deposition technique developed by Jolywood. The primary difference between the laser-treated and baseline samples was the front metallization process. The laser-treated group utilized Jolywood Special Injected Metallization (JSIM) in conjunction with customized Ag paste for the front contact formation on TOPCon solar cells. This involved a lower-temperature firing process to facilitate paste penetration through the front anti-reflection coating, culminating in the establishment of metal-semiconductor ohmic contact through whole-surface laser line scanning under reverse bias conditions. The laser operated at a wavelength of 1030 nm with a frequency of 1000 Hz. In contrast, the baseline samples underwent front metallization used standard commercial Ag/Al paste and a conventional firing process. Notably, both batches of TOPCon cells featured identical screen-printing pattern designs. Subsequent PV modules, comprising 144 half-cut cells, were produced via a standardized manufacturing process.

Wu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       portrays the schematic of the G-B module, with POE and expanded polyethylene (EPE) serving as the front and rear encapsulation mate - rials, respectively. Fig. 1 (c) shows the experimental flow of accelerated damp-heat testing. Prior to conducting the experimental procedures, the solar cells were cleaned using deionized water (DIW) followed by swift drying using a nitrogen gun to ensure all solar cells were clean before the experiment. Approximately 0.3 g of 0.9 wt% NaCl solution was deli - cately sprayed onto the front surface of selected samples, after which the samples were left to air dry naturally in a fume cupboard, maintaining room temperature and atmospheric conditions. Care was taken during the solution treatment phase to prevent contamination within and among the samples. After treatment, the samples were positioned vertically within individual polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cassettes, spaced as such to mitigate cross-contamination during the damp-heat testing phase. The DH85 tests were done in an ASLi Environment chamber set to a temperature of 85  ◦ C and a relative humidity of 85%. The chamber was cycled to room temperature between each measure - ment period (10 h) and reheated for subsequent stages of damp-heat treatment. We used two systems to determine the current-voltage (I–V) char - acteristics of solar cells. A Halm inline measurement system with a calibrated reference cell was used at the industrial production line and a LOANA solar cell analysis system for accelerated DH85 testing. From the I–V measurements, we extracted the power conversion efficiency (PCE), short-circuit current density (J sc ), open-circuit voltage (V oc ), fill factor (FF), and series resistance (R s ). The module-level DH85 testing followed IEC TS 62782:2016, and the module’s output was measured by a GIV- 200DS2616 flash tester from Gsolar Power [40]. Utilizing a BTimag - ing R3 tool equipped with a high open-circuit voltage lens, we generated photoluminescence (PL) and R s  images. Subsequent processing of luminescence images was carried out using LumiTools [41]. To evaluate the contact resistance, we specifically focused on the non-busbar regions of the TOPCon cells. Employing a FOBA M1000 scribing laser, we created 6 mm wide stripes for contact resistance assessment. The quantification of contact resistances involved utilizing the transfer length method (TLM) facilitated by a PV-tools TLM-SCAN+. Measure - ments were conducted before and after subjecting the cells to a 20-h accelerated DH85 test. Moreover, a Zeiss 550 Crossbeam cryo-focused ion-beam scanning electron microscope (cryo-FIB-SEM) was utilized to obtain cross- sectional images for analyzing metal contacts. Operating at 1.5 nA, the SEM probe maintained a high-tension electron (EHT) voltage of 20 kV. In standard kV mode, the FIB probe was configured to 30 kV and 50 pA. Under identical SEM conditions, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis using the Oxford Instruments Ultim® Max was per - formed, followed by result processing with AZtec software to reveal silver (Ag), lead (Pb), aluminium (Al), oxygen (O), sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Cell performance Fig. 2 and Table 1 show the I–V results of JSIM and baseline TOPCon solar cells. The average PCE for JSIM cells was 25.1%, slightly higher than the baseline cells at 25.0%. Notably, the short-circuit current density (J sc ) and open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of the baseline and JISM TOPCon solar cells were quite similar. The primary divergence lay in the fill factor (FF), with JSIM having a FF of 83.2%, surpassing the baseline with a value of 82.9%. This underlines JSIM’s ability to allow for higher quality contacts enabled by the a Ag screen printing paste without Al and the wider firing process window. To ensure direct comparability under accelerated DH85 testing in our subsequent stage, cells with average efficiency were chosen.

Throughout the entire DH85 testing period, the control samples showed consistently stable performance. Conversely, consistent with our prior observations [21],  Fig. 3.Relative changes in PCE, J sc , V oc , FF and R s  as a function of DH85 time for JSIM and baseline TOPCon samples.

Wu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       the baseline samples demonstrated rapid degradation, degrading by up to ~92.0% rel  after the 40-h DH85 test. Notably, the R s  of the Baseline-NaCl cells exhibited an approximately ~13,000% rel  increase after 40 h. This very high series resistance also affected the measured J sc  value as the current extraction of the solar cell was impeded by the higher resistive losses. In contrast, JSIM samples only showed a PCE degradation of approximately ~3.6% rel  after 40 h of DH85. The degra - dation in JSIM samples primarily stemmed from an increase in R s  of ~240% rel , which was significantly lower than the baseline TOPCon solar cells. The PL and R s  images of the JISM and baseline solar cells are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The PL images reveal no significant changes, indicating that the DH85 testing does not increase the overal recombination for the TOPCon solar cells in this study. However, some darker regions can be seen along the busbars of the samples. This suggests that the silicon- metal interface may be affected during the DH85 testing, leading to localized recombination issues in specific areas. In the Baseline-control group, an increase in R s  was observed for some regions, potentially due to accidental contamination or damage during the experiment. Notably, the R s  image of the Baseline-NaCl group shows a significant increase in R s  over the whole solar cell area after 40 h of DH85, consistent with the I–V changes shown in Fig. 3. The entire metal contacts on the surface were significantly affected by NaCl during DH85 testing. Conversely, the JSIM-NaCl samples did not show any significant degradation. While some regions displayed slight R s  increases, the majority of the surface maintained relatively low R s  levels. This indicates that the metal con - tacts in JSIM samples exhibited significantly less sensitivity to NaCl- induced deteroriation, resulting in TOPCon solar cells that can with - stand NaCl during DH85. 3.3.Contact resistance To get more insight into the cause for the increased R s , we investi - gated the contact resistances of JSIM and baseline samples both before and after 20 h of DH85 testing and the results are shown in Fig. 6. Across all control groups, there was a limited increase compared to the contaminated groups. In the JSIM-control group, the average measured contact resistance ( · c ) was approximately ~2.9 mOhmcm 2  before testing and slightly increased to ~3.1 mOhmcm 2  after the 20 h of DH85. Similarly, the Baseline-control group exhibited no significant increase after DH85 testing, with values ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mOhmcm 2 . However, the  · c  of Baseline-NaCl dramatically escalated from 1.3 to 200.6 mOhmcm 2  after 20 h of DH85. The slightly higher contact resistance for the JSIM group indicates that there is still room to further improve the contact formation using the JSIM process. For the JSIM- NaCl group, the initial  · c  measured ~2.7 mohmcm 2  increased to ~5.6 mohmcm 2  after the 20 h of DH85, which is orders of magnitude better compared to the to the baseline samples. This clearly shows that the baseline samples were more susceptible to corrosion, while JSIM sam - ples exhibited a substantial higher tolerance against NaCl-induced damage. Consequently, laser enhanced firing processes such as JSIM may enable TOPCon solar cells with a materially improved corrosion reliability. 3.4.FIB-SEM cross-section images To further investigate the contact failure mechanisms, we employed focused ion-beam techniques to acquire polished sections of the metal contacts. Alongside capturing SEM images, we utilized EDS for elemental analysis of the metal contacts. Fig. 7 (a) and (c) depict metal contacts predominantly composed of Ag which is as expected. The baseline samples clearly show the presence of Al in the contact, while no Al was detected in the JSIM metal contacts in this work. Notably, the edges of the Al-rich regions exhibited an overlay of O, indicating that the Al in the contact was partially oxidized. Additionally, no Na or Cl was detected in the EDS analysis of control samples. Fig. 7 (b) shows the Baseline-NaCl sample after 20 h of DH85 which looks substantially different from the Baseline-control sample. The Baseline-control samples kept the Al round particle state after DH85 testing, but, for Baseline NaCl, the internal distribution of Al was no longer concentrated but dispersed within the contact. Additionally, traces of O and Cl overlapped with Al, suggesting that the Al was corroded and oxidized by NaCl. This aligns with findings in the literature on Al alloy corrosion [42–45]. Due to the difference in electronegativity, Al exhibits a higher reactivity compared to Ag, potentially leading to galvanic corrosion within Ag/Al fingers [46]. As a result, under condi - tions involving active anions such as chloride ions in the presence of water at elevated temperatures, Al readily undergoes oxidation. This results in the loss of Al metallic properties, thereby affecting the elec - trical characteristics of the metal contacts. Consequently, voids were formed in these regions, and the remaining Al reacted with either O or Cl, rendering it ineffective in the contact mechanism. Moreover, this corrosion was not limited to the interior of the metal contact but could also extend to the interface between the metal contacts and Si surfaces. Given that Al can form Ag/Al spikes during the contact firing step [47, 48], corrosion of Al might also alter the interface contact properties, leading to a significant increase in contact resistance as illustrated in Fig. 6 (b). Furthermore, the Pb in Baseline-NaCl exhibited overlap and influence from Cl, potentially a side effect of Al redox reactions. PbO plays a key role in the fritting process as well as in the quality of the contact between silicon and silver. These effects collectively contributed to the rapid and severe increase in R s  observed in Figs. 3 and 5. Conversely, the JSIM contacts displayed significantly less deterio - ration by NaCl after 20 h of DH85, as depicted in Fig. 7 (d). We observed  Fig. 6.The front-side contact resistance ( · c ) of the NaCl-sprayed and control stripes from (a) JMIS and (b) baseline TOPCon solar cells before and after 20 h of DH85.   X. Wu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fig. 7.Cross-section SEM images of front-side TOPCon samples after 40-h DH85 and corresponding EDS mappings of Ag, Pb, Al, O, Na, Cl. The samples were prepared by cryo-FIB and the description of the samples can be found in Fig. 1.  X. Wu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       only a trace amount of Cl at the Si/Ag interface, suggesting that NaCl induced some reaction on the Ag/Si alloy but was limited to exposed regions. No indications of metal or glass frit failures were evident within the contact. Unlike the baseline samples, NaCl did not induce any re - action within the JSIM metal contacts. Consequently, JSIM TOPCon solar cells show an increased resistance to NaCl corrosion under DH85 conditions and experienced less PCE loss compared to baseline TOPCon solar cells during the testing period. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Al content in the metallization paste is the main cause for its low corrosion resistance, and thus, reducing or removing Al from the paste results in TOPCon solar cells with a high corrosion resistance. 3.5.Module results To further substantiate the stability of JSIM TOPCon solar cells, we fabricated commercial-sized G-B modules comprising 144 half-cut cells and subjected them to standard module-level DH85 testing and compared the results to modules made using baseline solar cells. Throughout the testing phase, electroluminescence imaging was con - ducted to detect potential additional cracks or other module failures. The I–V results are shown in Fig. 8. Following 1000 h of DH85 testing,  Fig. 8.Relative change in module I–V parameters for glass-backsheet (G–B) modules fabricated with JSIM and baseline TOPCon solar cells after 1000 hourse of DH85.

Wu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       JSIM modules experienced only a ~2.1% rel  decrease in maximum power (P max ), whereas baseline modules encountered a more substantial ~7.3% rel  reduction in PCE. The reduction in short-circuit current (I sc ) was ~1.2% rel  for JSIM modules and ~2.2% rel  for baseline modules, while both exhibited a ~0.2% rel  loss in V oc . The cause for the drop in I sc  is likely related to changes in the optics of the module which are not related to the solar cells and thus were omitted from the further dis - cussion. The minimal loss in V oc  is consistent with the results presented in Sections 3.1 to 3.3, which indicated that corrosion predominantly affects the series resistance of the solar cells, i.e., affecting the FF of the module. The JSIM modules exhibited a ~0.6% rel  FF decline, whereas baseline modules suffered a significantly higher ~4.9% rel  FF loss. This is consistent with an increase of R s  at the module level due to cell-level contact degradation in baseline modules. Overall, JSIM G-B modules demonstrated superior reliability under DH85 conditions, showcasing better stability compared to their baseline counterparts. The electroluminescence images of JSIM and baseline modules shown in Fig. 9 reveal no discernible differences between the JSIM modules. However, in baseline modules, noticeable failure patterns are evident along the contacts. This serves as additional evidence supporting the long-term stability of JSIM TOPCon cells within G-B modules. 4.Conclusion TOPCon technology is expected to become the dominant technology in 2024 due to its higher efficiency and relatively low manufacturing costs. Unfortunately, various reports have shown that the TOPCon technology is more sensitive to degradation, in particular corrosion, and this could potentially result in higher yearly degradation negatively affecting the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of the TOPCon tech - nology. This study demonstrates that laser-assisted firing significantly enhances the corrosion resistance of TOPCon solar cells. This improve - ment is attributed to the broader processing window offered by the firing technique and the capability to employ pastes that do not contain aluminum to contact the lightly-doped boron surface at the front of the TOPCon solar cell. In this work we used the Jolywood Special Injected Metallization (JSIM) method and compared it to baseline TOPCon solar cells fabricated using conventional pastes and firing. Solar cells were exposed to NaCl and underwent 20 h of damp heat testing under 85  � C and 85% relative humidity (DH85). The baseline cells demonstrated rapid degradation, while JSIM cells only showed a minor drop in per - formance. The contact resistance of the NaCl-exposed JSIM cells was relatively unaffected by after 20 h of DH85, while the NaCl-exposed solar cells contact resistance increased by over two orders of magni - tude. Scanning electron microscopy confirm significant chemical re - actions in the baseline solar cells, in particular related to Al, consistent with the hypothesis that the relatively high Al content, used to improve the electrical contact between the metal paste and the lightly boron- doped silicon surface, is the cause for its low corrosion-resistance. The cell results were confirmed at the module level where JSIM TOPCon G-B modules demonstrated superior reliability compared to baseline TOP - Con modules after module DH85 testing. Consequently, this work shows that laser-assisted firing process such as JSIM can significantly improve the intrinsic corrosion-resistance of TOPCon solar cells. This not only results in more stable TOPCon modules, but also enables the use of lower cost bill of materials for the TOPCon technology, further reducing the LCOE of this technology.

Patterning techniques arrange contacts on the shaded side of the silicon wafer, which oers benets for light incidence as well. However, the patterning process complicates production and results in power loss. We employed lasers to streamline the fabrication of back-contact solar cells and enhance the power-conversion eciency. Using this approach, we produced a silicon solar cell that exceeded 27% eciency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers were deposited onto the wafer for surface passivation and to collect light-generated carriers. A dense passivating contact, which diers from conventional technology practice, was developed. Pulsed picosecond lasers operating at dierent wavelengths were used to create the back-contact patterns. The approach developed is a streamlined process for producing high-performance back-contact silicon solar cells, with a total eective processing time of about one-third that of the emerging mainstream technology.  To meet the terawatt demand, we developed indium-less cells at 26.5% eciency and precious silver-free cells at 26.2% eciency. Thus, the integration of solar solutions into buildings and transportation is poised to expand with these technological advances. Silicon solar cells usually have a single electrode on each side so that they are front- and back-contact cells. The electrode grid on the sunny side obstructs light, thus reducing energy input. Placing both terminals on the shaded side creates back-contact solar cells that are potentially more efficient and also aesthetically appealing. In 1975, Schwartz and Lammert at Purdue University introduced interdigitated-back-contact solar cells4. Swanson at Stanford University later developed a similar point-contact solar cell, achieving a record efficiency of 22.3% in 19885. SunPower, established in 1985, has since become a pioneer in commer-cializing interdigitated-back-contact technology. The heterojunction back-contact (HBC) cell structure was first developed by Lu etal. at the University of Delaware in 20076. Subsequently, companies like Sharp, Panasonic and Kaneka have improved HBC technology7,8. In 2017, Kaneka achieved a record 26.7% power-conversion efficiency (PCE) for Si solar cells with the HBC structure9. This record was later surpassed by LONGi with a 26.8% Si heterojunction (SHJ) front- and back-contact solar cell in 202210. These achievements are guiding efforts in improv-ing Si solar cell performance through combining the heterojunction technology with the back-contact structure. A big challenge in mak-ing HBC solar cells is the patterning on the back side, which usually introduces process complexity and power output losses. Although potential solutions have been explored, such as photolithography, inkjet printing, insitu shadow masking and laser patterning, they face technological or cost issues that are still inadequately addressed in mass production1116. Laser patterning is considered the most economical method for fabricating back-contact solar cells; however, the highest PCE of fully laser-processed HBCs reported so far by the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre is only 22.5%13. Another challenge is how to decouple the use of rare indium and precious silver from the hetero-junction technology, which is crucial as we enter the terawatt era. In this work, we propose a solution to these challenges in manufacturing high-efficiency HBC solar cells for a sustainable future. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08110-8Received: 20 March 2024Accepted: 25 September 2024Published online: 1 October 2024  Check for updates 1Central R&D Institute, LONGi Green Energy Technology Co.

At the device level, processes aiming to reduce the recombination current density (J0) and contact resistivity (c) contrib-ute to the overall PCE (Fig.1b)17. SHJ uses thin hydrogen-containing Si layers as passivating contacts. The N-contact typically comprises intrinsic/n-type amorphous layers (i:a-Si:H/n:a-Si:H), whereas the P-contact comprises intrinsic/p-type amorphous layers (p-i:a-Si:H/p:a-Si:H). We use ‘i’ for the intrinsic amorphous silicon layer in the N-contact and ‘p-i’ for the P-contact in the rest of this article, unless oth-erwise specified. The back pattern of our cells has about 70,000mm of borders. Thus, besides the surface passivation, this unique fea-ture of back-contact cells makes it crucial to minimize the recom-bination at the borders. With these factors in mind, we identified three key process advances for achieving better than 27% PCE: dense passivating contacts, laser patterning without laser-beam-induced damage and undercut control through refining the wet chemical  process (Fig.1b).Another important factor when making back-contact solar cells is electrical shading18 (Fig.1c). Besides reducing the bulk and surface recombination, this loss can be reduced by optimizing the contact pitch and carefully choosing the resistivity of the substrate. The 780µm pitch (P-contact/gap/N-contact/gap) and P/N ratio of 1.4 (P-contact width over N-contact width) used in our cell processes were based on simu-lation results (Fig.1d). Our simulations comprehensively considered their impact on the effects of shading (short-circuit current density Jsc) and on the overall carrier recombination and transport (the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage Voc). The most efficient cells were on 175-µm-thick (after texturing) 1.3–1.8cm silicon wafers.On a full M6 wafer (total area 274.4cm2), the highest PCE of 26.93% was achieved with low J0 (0.8fAcm2) and c (c-n=25 and c-p=40mcm2 for the N-contact and P-contact resistivities, respectively) values, and Jsc=42.10mAcm2. Masking the wafer edge, a PCE of 27.3% was attained at a designated area of 243.0cm2 (Fig.1e). The external quan-tum efficiency and reflection measured for this cell are shown in Fig.1f. The lower current density of the full-area solar cell was attributed to imperfect passivation at the wafer edges, which indicates that potential improvements could be made by ameliorating the edge losses.

In previ-ous studies, we uncovered two approaches for epitaxy suppression in i:a-Si:H layer deposition to achieve enhanced passivation (Fig.2a)19,20.  A sandwiched passivation layer (i0/i1/i2) with an H-rich porous first layer (i0) deposited onto an oxygen-modified c-Si surface offered an optimal solution. However, this H-rich layer is less conductive com-pared to a denser state. We use the word ‘dense’ in this work to describe layers containing less hydrogen (having a low microstructure factor R*). We developed dense passivating contacts to address both passivation and contact resistivity for N contacts.After being dipped in HF, the c-Si surface became H-covered with Si dangling bonds (Si-DBs) and strained Si–Si dimers. As the main con-stituent of the silane plasma, SiH3 radicals can possibly: (A) become adsorbed on Si-DBs to form SiH–SiH2, (B) become adsorbed on dimers to form Si–SiH2–SiH or (C) abstract H atoms from the Si surface, return-ing to the SiH4 gas phase21–23. With forward reactions A and B proceed-ing, the newly formed SiH2– sites adsorbed more SiH3 energetically, impeding adatom diffusion for epitaxy through a layer-by-layer mode24–26. However, when the rates of both the A and B reactions are low, what probably happens is that nanotwins form through an island growth mode and degrade surface passivation27. This can largely be prevented by elevating the temperature, courtesy of the much higher activation energy of reaction B (0.7–0.9eV) compared to A (nearly zero) and C (0.02eV)21,27. This is illustrated in Fig.2b. The ratio of the reac-tion rates at temperatures over 190°C to that at 190°C (K*) increased rapidly with the activation energy. An elevated temperature will also accelerate the release of H, rendering the film denser and, thus, more conductive28. Besides the density of Si-DB and the epitaxy, another factor impacting the i:a-Si:H/c-Si interface passivation is the extra H supplied from overlying layers (Fig.2c, inset). If Si-DBs and epitaxy are suppressed, the requirement of H supply from the i1 reservoir will also be alleviated.With this SiH2 promotion at elevated temperature approach, excel-lent passivation was achieved using an i0 layer deposited at 240°C.  A higher effective lifetime, especially at lower to mid-injection levels, was exhibited compared to the layers deposited at lower temperatures (Fig.2c). Notably, 240°C is a significant divergence from the common practice that favours 180–210°C for heterojunctions (Fig.2d). The excellent passivation quality in combination with the relatively low hydrogen content of 18% (Fig.2e) indicates that Si-DBs and epitaxy at the interface were, indeed, suppressed, which confirms that the adop-tion of a denser i1 layer did not compromise the passivation, as afore-mentioned. In the results shown in Fig.2c–f, i1 was always tuned to have the same R* as i0. Tuning R* for both i0 and i1 from 0.76 to 0.40 resulted in a drastic drop in c from 93 to 43mcm2 (Fig.2f and Extended Data Fig.2). Note that these c values and effective lifetimeswere measured after the high-intensity illuminated annealing (Extended Data Fig.3a,b). We also found that a denser i layer was more resistant to laser fluence (Fig.2g). More detailed properties and deposition parameters for i0, i1 and i2 can be found in Extended Data Table1.Laser patterningHighly precise and rapid laser systems offer substantial benefits in the high-volume photovoltaic (PV) industry. A single gigawatt-scale pro-duction line can handle approximately 15,000 wafers per hour, equiva-lent to one-third of the capacity of the entire semiconductor industry29. At present, a definitive pathway for laser-patterned HBC solar cells with efficiencies beyond 26% is not available due to laser-beam-induced damage, which specifically causes Voc and fill factor loss by degrading the amorphous passivating contact or the c-Si interface30,31.

Nature | Vol  |  November  | 607reported efficiency for laser-patterned HBC is only 22.5%, significantly lower than the 26.7% efficiency achieved with photolithography.In our fabrication of HBC solar cells, three laser-patterning steps  (P1, P2 and P3) were used to create the interdigitated N/P polarity by selectively removing N-contact, P-contact and indium tin oxide (ITO) layers, respectively (Extended Data Fig.1). The top-hat-shaped laser beam was operated in two modes. Overlap mode, used in P1 and P3, completely removed a layer, whereas the single-shot mode used in P2 preserved the region between consecutive shots (Fig.3a). The single-shot mode created partial, instead of full-area, contact between the n:a-Si:H film and the ITO layer. We found that this was necessary to maintain the passivation of the underlying N contact. For the same purpose, pulsed green (532nm) and ultraviolet (355nm) picosecond lasers were used in P2 and P3, respectively, to minimize heat impact32.The relations among the laser fluence, the passivation quality of i:a-Si:H/n:a-Si:H and the SiNx thickness was explored through simulation and experiments. Taking the P2 process, for example, the temperatures of both the P-contact (Fig.3b) and the N-contact i layer (Fig.3c) were simulated with COMSOL Multiphysics by coupling the two-temperature model with the wave optics module. The optical properties of the lay-ers required in the simulation were measured (Fig.3d). Based on the simulation results, we determined that a threshold laser fluence of 94mJcm2 was required to open the P-contact (Extended Data Fig.4a). Starting from this threshold, an increasing sequence of laser fluences was applied (Extended Data Fig.4b), and the corresponding effective lifetimes were measured (Fig.3c). An appropriate laser fluence should be high enough to effectively remove the P-contact and, in combination with subsequent wet chemical processes, prepare a clean interface for the contact with ITO, yet it should not be high enough to damage the N-contact passivation. In practice, the annotated point 1 in Fig.3c was employed in P2. The simulated i-layer temperature offers more insights into the degradation mechanism of the N-contact passivation. The two annotated inflection points on the effective lifetime curve at 165 and 243mJcm2 laser fluences correspond to 860 and 1,060°C, respectively. In this regard, the passivation degradation in the initial stage was probably due to hydrogen debonding under heat impact. At temperatures close to 1,000°C, structural changes in the i layer can occur, leading to a continuous decline in the effective lifetime. Beyond point 2, the passivation was completely compromised.The SiNx thickness was determined from both the P2 and P3 pro-cesses. The simulated i-layer temperature in P2 increased at certain SiNx thicknesses due to interference (Fig.3e). However, in P3 the i-layer temperature monotonically decreased with increasing SiNx thickness due to strong absorption by the SiNx layer at 355nm. A thickness of around 140nm was deemed to be suitable, as the temperature of the i layer could be kept below 700°C in both processes. The simulated tem-perature profiles with 140nm SiNx during a picosecond laser pulse in P2 and P3 are illustrated to provide an intuitive understanding (Fig.3f,g).Notably, devices fabricated with full laser patterning outperformed those using photolithography for P3 (Extended Data Fig.4c–f). This can probably be attributed to the damage to the front i:a-Si:H passiva-tion caused by the alkaline media used to remove the photoresist. We consistently observed a higher Jsc and fill factor in fully laser-processed HBC solar cells. Note that completely removing the entire photoresist without leaving a noticeable residue is challenging and potentially requires the application of chemicals suitable for the semiconductor industry but not for the PV industry.Undercut controlA primary issue at the pattern borders is undercutting, which compli-cates the passivation of the c-Si surface beneath the SiNx mask formed during the wet chemical process following the P1 step. The P1 process ablates the mask i layer (a sacrificial amorphous silicon layer used for P1 patterning) in the p region to expose the SiNx film, which is then etched away by an HF solution. This is followed by a KOH etch with two  –200–1000–400–300–200–1000600900 defg 1001,000100150200250801201602002401,5002,0002,5003,0003,5001294112129147165184203212223232243255Single-shotOverlap Single-shotOverlapDepth (nm)Temp.

An over-etch is typically performed to ensure the latter goal is achieved. During this process, the masked i:a-Si/n:a-Si in adjacent regions is etched laterally, whereas the SiNx remains largely unaffected (Extended Data Fig.5a,b). The protruding SiNx can shield the P-contact deposition, leaving that area unpassivated.We have found that undercutting can be significantly suppressed by adding sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS, C18H29NaO3S) to the KOH solution. By varying the concentration of the additive, we could achieve precise control of the etching rate within the range 3–30nmmin1. Previous studies indicated that incorporating sur-factants into the KOH solution can modify both the etch rates and the undercutting33,34. The surfactant molecules create a dense layer on specific crystal orientations and inhibit the chemical reaction between the alkaline solution and silicon atoms. In this work, we speculate that the anionic SDBS additive adsorbs more at the SiNx interface, where it has positive fixed charges, so that it effectively suppresses lateral chemical reactions, which results in minimal undercutting (Extended Data Fig.5c,d). A clear correlation between the undercut depth and Voc was observed experimentally, complementing our understanding of the power loss in the back-contact cell process (Extended Data Fig.5e).Terawatt-scale sustainabilityTo achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century, annual PV production is projected to reach 3TW by 203235. A sustainability assessment of PV technologies at the terawatt-scale, thus, has significance. We developed a tailored ESMRC model (efficiency, scalability, manufacturability, reliability and circularity) for this evaluation (Extended Data Table2). Silicon PV technologies, such as passivated-emitter rear contact (PERC), tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), SHJ and HBC, demonstrate cell efficiencies surpassing the 25.0% threshold. Moreover, the solar panels are reliable in field applications. These solar panels typically attain over 93% recovery yield of materials, confirming good circular-ity36. Scalability and manufacturability emerge as decisive factors for terawatt-scale sustainability concerns.A 25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is required to reach 3TW annual PV production by 2030 (Fig.4a). Critical material supply, particularly silver and indium, limits the scalability of Si PV technolo-gies, although the supply of Si is sufficient (Extended Data Table3). Capping annual Ag consumption at 20% of total production severely restricts annual PV production to 637GW due to the current supply of around 5,200tonnesyr1 and a minimum Ag amount per cell of 8mgW1 (ref. 37). Meeting the 3TW production target by 2030 entails a virtually impossible CAGR of 36% or 16% for Ag supply (15 and 5mgW1, respec-tively), even if the price does not surge. Hence, alternative technolo-gies for metallizing Si solar cells using abundant materials, such as copper (Cu), are in urgent need. Indium-based PV technologies, like SHJ and HBC, could sustain 3TW annual production if each cell has an ITO layer of around 3nm and assuming 20% consumption of the world indium production per annum. This poses a significant tech-nological challenge for heterojunctions. We achieved 26.5% efficiency with In-less HBC solar cells using a 7nm ITO layer (Fig.4b).

Nature | Vol  |  November  | 609conductivity needs, we applied 30nm SnO2 onto the ultra-thin ITO layer. This positions HBC as a terawatt-scale technology that could satisfy 30% of the total PV demand (a 16% CAGR would meet the full demand). We also demonstrated 26.2% efficiency for HBC solar cells metallized by screen-printed low-temperature Cu paste (Fig.4c). We expect that, after further advances in these technologies, In-less in combination with Cu-metallized HBC could become an important component technology for reaching the 3TW target, thereby support-ing the transition to renewable energy for carbon neutrality. Overall, in the ESMRC evaluation, HBC outperformed PERC, TOPCon and SHJ in efficiency and scalability but was inferior in terms of manufacturability (Fig.4d). PERC and TOPCon have scalability limitations because they rely on silver contacts. This is especially evident in TOPCon solar cells, as the extensively used laser-enhanced contact optimization process is applicable only for fired silver contacts38.The remaining manufacturability concerns, namely extra pattern-ing steps and high capital expenditure, lessen HBC’s advantage. Using laser patterning enhanced HBC’s performance in the ESMRC evaluation (Fig.4e). For HBC, the effective process time, defined as the total pro-cess time excluding intermediate handling steps, was merely one-third of that for TOPCon (Fig.4f). Additionally, this low-temperature process has a low carbon footprint. Upscaling a PV technology to large-scale manufacturing usually calls for collective efforts across the industry. We have fabricated a 634W solar module assembled from 144 pieces of 182mm×91mm HBC solar cells, with a median efficiency of 26.8% for our pilot production line (Extended Data Fig.6). We emphasize that HBC is a prominent terawatt-scale technology that could reduce the capital expenditure needed for mass production. Insights from analogous experiences in the electric vehicle manufacturing sector could enrich our understanding of HBC technology. In the near future, exploring a hybrid structure with promising theoretical efficiency could reduce the costly use of parallel-plate plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) by one-third to two-thirds39.Online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa-ries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl-edgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08110-8.1.

The bulk lifetime for an injection of 5×1014cm3 was over 8ms as determined by Sinton Instruments BCT400 at the ingot level. Saw damage was removed and the wafters were polished before the cell architecture was fabricated. Cell fabrication involved 12 main steps: (1) N-contact formation: the i:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a silane (SiH4) flow in PECVD chamber 1 at 13.56MHz and 240°C. Sub-sequently, the n:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a mixed SiH4 and PH3 flow in chamber 2 at 40.68MHz and 240°C. (2) Mask deposition: A stack of SiNx/mask-i:a-Si layers is deposited in sequence in PECVD chamber 3 at 13.56MHz and 190°C. (3) Laser patterning 1 (P1): A pulsed green picosecond laser (100kHz and 532nm) with a spot of 250µm is used to ablate the as-deposited films at a power intensity of 876mJcm2 to form patterns. (4) Wet chemical cleaning 1 (WET1): The residuals in the region processed in P1 are removed using an alkali (KOH) and an acid (HF) to expose the c-Si surface for subsequent CVD processes. (5) P-contact formation: The p-i:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a silane flow in PECVD chamber 4 at 13.56MHz and 190°C. Subsequently, the p:a-Si:H layer is deposited in a mixed SiH4 and B2H6 flow in chamber 5 at 40.68MHz and 190°C. (6) Laser patterning 2 (P2): A pulsed green picosecond laser (100kHz and 532nm) with a spot size of 250µm is used to ablate the designed N-contact regions to remove the overlying P-contact layers. (7) Wet chemical cleaning 2 (WET2): The cell is cleaned (HCl/H2O2) and dipped in HF for subsequent CVD process. (8) Front passivation: The front i:a-Si:H layer is deposited in PECVD chamber 6 at 13.56MHz and 240°C, followed by SiNx/SiOx stack deposition in chamber 7 at 13.56MHz and 190°C. (The front i:a-Si:H layer is the amorphous silicon layer used to passivate the front surface.) (9) Wet chemical cleaning 3 (WET3): The cell is dipped into HF to remove wrap-around SiNx/SiOx (the front film was thinned by 10–15nm in step 8). (10) TCO(transparent conductive oxide) deposition: An ITO (In2O3:SnO4) layer is deposited using direct current sputtering at 160°C. (11) Laser patterning 3 (P3): A pulsed ultraviolet picosecond laser (400kHz and 355nm) is used to ablate the designed gap region to remove the ITO for isolation. (12) Metallization: Silver paste is screen-printed onto the contacts and fired at 170°C in air ventilation to form electrodes. After screen-printing, the Cu paste is fired at the same temperature but in ambient N2. After fabrication, high-intensity illuminated annealing is performed under 60kWm2 and 200°C for 90s. An LED light matrix (wavelength 400–800nm) is used for illumination.Characterization and simulationThe current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells were meas-ured using a Sinton FCT-650 IV tester under standard test condition (AM 1.5G, 1,000Wm2 and 25°C). The effective lifetime was obtained from a Sinton Instruments WCT-120 instrument in transient mode. The surface recombination parameter J0 was extracted using the Kane and Swanson method. The contact resistivity was measured using the Cox and Strack method. The current loss induced by electrical shading was characterized by our in-house light-beam-induced current system. Measurements were made by a HORIBA LabRAM Odyssey instrument, with a laser (532nm, 20µm spot size and 70mW) as the light-beam source. The platform was moved when scanning. A precision Keithley 2450 source meter was used to measure the induced current.The thickness, refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of the single layers were acquired from a J.A. Woollam M-2000 Ellipsometer. The microstructure (R*) and hydrogen content (CH) of the intrinsic a-Si:H layers were acquired from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using a Nicolet IS-10 spectrometer according to the following formulae: R I II*=+,2,100 2,0002,100 C N NN=+,HH HSi NAIAI=×+×, H2,0002,0002,1002,100where A2,000=9.0×1019cm2 and A2,100=2.2×1020cm2 are proportion-ality constants for the hydrogen stretching mode at 2,000cm1 and 2,100cm1. I2,000 and I2,100 are the integrated absorption peak intensi-ties at 2,000 and 2,100cm1, respectively. NH is the atomic density of hydrogen, and NSi=5×1022cm3 is the atomic density of pure silicon. The relative reaction rate coefficient K* is defined as the ratio of reac-tion rate constant k at temperatures T2 to T1. The Arrhenius equation determines that for a chemical reaction:    ΩkcEkT=exp,aBwhere c is the frequency factor, Ea the activation energy, kB the Boltz-mann constant and T the temperature. Accordingly, K* can be expressed as: KEkTT*=exp11.aB12    Even without knowing the frequency factor, it is still possible to assess the relative change of the reaction rate from K*.When a film was too thin to be measured by the ellipsometer (for example, i0, i1 and i2), a much thicker version was prepared by extend-ing the deposition time, and this was measured. The thickness of the actual thin layer was then estimated by assuming it was proportional to the deposition time.The transient thermal response in each layer following laser fluence was simulated using the finite element method in COMSOL Multiphys-ics 6.1. The simulation couples the two-temperature model with the wave optics module to give a comprehensive analysis of the thermal and optical intricacies inherent in the process. The input parameters for the two-temperature model were sourced from publicly available reports. The optical inputs, specifically the absorption coefficient () for the wave optics modelling, were obtained from measurements of individual layers. The absorption coefficient was determined using the Beer–Lambert Law, where =2.303A/t, with A representing the absorb-ance and t denoting the thickness of the film. The layer’s absorbance was measured using a LAMBDA 1050+UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer.The I–V characteristics of the solar cells were simulated in Quokka 3.The ESMRC modelFrom a first-principle perspective, the ESMRC model evaluates the sus-tainability of a PV technology in five dimensions: efficiency, scalability, manufacturability, reliability and circularity. Efficiency pertains to the solar cell’s conversion of solar energy to electricity. Scalability exam-ines critical material demands and supply dynamics for widespread deployment. Manufacturability assesses the efficiency of production processes in terms of cost and market competitiveness. Reliability gauges the consistency of the performance of a solar panel under dif-ferent conditions. Circularity evaluates the technology’s alignment with circular economy principles, especially recycling and sustainable resource utilization. Supplementary Table1 summarizes key aspects of the ESMRC factors, assessed on a scale from very low (1) to very high (5),  with the scale representing scores of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for very low, low, medium, high and very high, respectively (Extended Data Table2).The scalability assessment concentrates on the critical material demand and supply required to achieve 3TW of annual PV produc-tion by 2030. Silicon solar cells commonly incorporate elements such  as silicon (Si), boron (B), phosphorus (P), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), silver (Ag), aluminium (Al), copper (Cu), indium (In) and tin (Sn). These elements are classified as earth-abundant (Si, B, P, O, H, N, Al, Cu and Sn), rare (In) and noble (Ag). The critical evaluation focuses on Si, In and Ag to determine whether their annual production and supply can meet the demands of the PV industry’s expansion. The data used for the assessment were sourced from the United States Geological Survey46. Data on annual PV production capacity were obtained from the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics published by the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association47. Annual PV produc-tion was estimated as the product of the PV production capacity and an optimal utilization rate of 0.85 (Extended Data Table3).Data availabilityThe original data supporting the current study are available from the lead contact on request. 46.

Herein, reactive ion etching technique is used to fabricate nanopores on top of pre-formed micron-pyramid silicon surface, called NPP structure. The equivalent medium layer with graded refractive index appeared on NPP textures makes the absorption of almost all incident light independent of the wavelength and angle. However, serious Auger recombination and surface recombination associated with NPP structure is detrimental to emitter passivation, usually counteracting the photocurrent gain. To identify an appropriate balance of light-trapping and surface passivation, we investigate the impact of different radio-frequency power (P RF ) on the optical and electrical properties of TOPCon solar cells and discusses the underlying structural causes behind these observed improvements. Finally, we demonstrate NPP TOPCon solar cells with an average short-circuit current density of 41.44 mA/cm 2  and an average PCE of 23.55% at the P RF  of 600 W. Besides, the external quantum efficiency results under various incident angles from 0 ◦ to 70 ◦ exhibited excellent wide-angle spectral absorption capa - bility, which is significant for solar cells working in an outdoor environment.    1.Introduction Over the past few years, the industrial-level bifacial tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells have demonstrated an impressive development speed, with photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 24.5% [1]. Moreover, TOPCon solar cells allow a compatibility with mainstream passivated emitter and rear solar cells (PERC) mass production, and a maximum theoretical PCE up to 28.7%, which are promising as an alternative to next-generation solar cell technology [2]. Unfortunately, the front-side optical reflection loss still accounts for a large portion of power loss for bifacial TOPCon solar cells, caused by conventional micron-pyramid texture with poor short-wavelength absorption [3,4]. Hence, researchers put forward and developed various advanced light-trapping textures to enhance the uti - lization of the available solar spectrum and obtain a high photocurrent density (J ph ) [5,6]. Nanostructured silicon texture, also known as “black silicon (b-Si)” due to superior antireflection capability, is considered a powerful approach for improving J ph , and has been widely studied in many fields, such as photodetectors [7,8], biological monitors [9]. In addition, b-Si textures maintain an effective reflection elimination over a wide range of incident angles () [10–12], which is significant for evaluating the power generation benefits of solar cells under constantly changing sun angle. Many attempts have been made to integrate b-Si textures with various solar cells, such as the traditional aluminum back surface field solar cells, PERC, or interdigitated back-contact back- - junction (IBC) solar cells [3,13–15]. In general, b-Si textures can be formed by various techniques, including laser texturing [16,17], reactive ion etching (RIE) [18,19], and metal-catalyzed chemical etching (MCCE) [13,20,21]. Among those, RIE technique is more suitable for creating b-Si textures in in - dustrial solar cell production because of large-scale preparation, rapid reaction, and no noble metal pollution [22–25]. Until now there have been some laboratory-grade attempts on n-type silicon solar cells based RIE technique. For example, Savin et al. [19] fabricated a nanopillar surface using RIE in IBC solar cells with a short-circuit density (J sc ) of 42.2 mA/cm 2  and a relative J sc  loss of less than 1% at the  of 60 ◦ in comparison to the normal incidence ( =0 ◦ ). To inhibit emitter recombination of b-Si prepared by RIE, G. von Gastrow et al. [26]  *Corresponding author. **Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: liucui@ecust.edu.cn (C.

However, there is little information about the integration of RIE b-Si textures with n-type industrial TOPCon solar cells. In this work, we have successfully developed the RIE b-Si technique for high-efficient n-type bifacial TOPCon solar cells in existing industrial production lines. Here, the nano/micron-composite textures were formed by a texture-on-texture approach. In other words, the RIE technique uniformly creates nanopores on top of a pre-formed alkaline etched micron-pyramid surface, named as NPP structure. Specifically, the impacts of different RIE radio-frequency power (P RF ) on the photo - voltaic properties of NPP TOPCon solar cells were systematically investigated. Meanwhile, an optimized boron diffusion process and a high-quality passivation stack of ALD-Al 2 O 3 /plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon nitride (SiN x ) layer were discussed and used to keep the balance of light-trapping and surface passivation. As a result, the industrial large-scale NPP TOPCon solar cells at the P RF  of 600 W exhibit high performance with an average J sc  of 41.44 mA/cm 2  and an average PCE of 23.55%. In addition, we demonstrated the wide- angle power generation capability of NPP TOPCon solar cells, with the J sc  loss under 4.5% for the  below 70 ◦ . This paper provides a reference for the application of RIE b-Si technique in industrial n-type bifacial TOPCon solar cells. 2.Experimental 2.1.Surface textures For NPP TOPCon solar cells, n-type Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers with 158.75 ×158.75 mm 2  size, (100) grain orientation, 1–3 cm-re - sistivity, and 170   m-thickness were applied as substrates. Different from pure b-Si textures prepared from a planar silicon wafer, the first step in this process was immersing the silicon wafers after a standard RCA cleaning in a mixture of 1.2 wt% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 6 wt% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) at 82  ◦ C for 20 min to form a random micron-pyramid surface. Next, a maskless RIE system with a gas mixture of O 2 , Cl 2  and SF 6  was used to prepare packed nanopores on random micron-pyramid surface. The feature size of NPP structures is regulated and controlled by P RF  (100 W, 300 W, 600 W). This P RF  parameter was chosen as a variable because it greatly affects the dissociation rate of reactive gases and bombardment kinetic energy of reactive ions, thus impacting the morphology and size [27,28]. The chemical etching mechanisms of this RIE system are explained by Equations (1)–(3) [24, 29,30]: Si+4F * SiF 4 (1)  Si+xCl * SiCl x 	(2)  xSi+yO * +zF * Si x O y F z  (3) Fig. 1a delineated the preparation schematic of NPP structures. After that, to remove the plasma-induced damaged layer and round off the sharp silicon structure, the samples were immersed in a buffered oxide etching (BOE) recipe of ammonium fluoride (NH 4 F), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and water (H 2 O). 2.2.Fabrication of solar cells The cross-sectional conceptual diagram of NPP TOPCon solar cells is shown in Fig. 1b. In this work, conventional TOPCon solar cells with micron-pyramid texture were set as one reference group, and b-Si TOPCon solar cells with NPP textures at different P RF  were set as three test groups. The manufacturing process flow of reference and test TOPCon solar cells is outlined in Fig. 1c. The initial quantity of samples per group was 40 silicon wafers. The silicon wafers of test groups have undergone a baseline process of conventional TOPCon solar cells as well as an additional RIE step and a pore-widening process. All silicon wafers were inserted in one graphite boat to form a p-type emitter using boron tribromide source, consisting of a boron trioxide deposition process and a subsequent drive-in process. Then, after etching rear borosilicate glass by HF/HNO 3  mixed solution, a tunnel SiO x  film (~1.5 nm) and an intrinsic amorphous silicon layer (~140 nm) were deposited on both sides of silicon wafers in thermal oxidation method and low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method, respectively. To obtain back-side n-type TOPCon structure, phosphorus dopant was first lead  Fig. 1.Design and process of NPP TOPCon solar cells. (a) The preparation schematic for NPP structures.

Xu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        into the intrinsic amorphous silicon layer by ion implantation method, and a following 900  ◦ C thermal annealing process was used to activate phosphorus atoms and transform from amorphous to polycrystalline. The n-type polysilicon at the front-side and the wafer edges was removed by HF/HNO 3  mixed solution and a SiN x  layer via PECVD was covered on rear surface to intensify passivation performance. Then, to suppress surface recombination and reflectance loss, the ALD-Al 2 O 3  (~4 nm)/PECVD-SiN x  (~75 nm) stacked films were deposited on various texturing emitters. Finally, a metallization pattern with 12 busbars was formed by a screen printing and co-sintered process. It is noteworthy that in view of the extensive number of recombination caused by NPP structures, the boron diffusion process and surface passivation technique were optimized and discussed on baseline process. 2.3.Characterization Morphologies and feature sizes of NPP structures were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU5000). The reflectance spectra of silicon wafers and solar cells were determined by hemi - spherical reflectance spectrometry with an integrating sphere from 300 to 1200 nm. The four-probes method was used to measure the sheet resistance (R sheet ) of boron doping emitter. The surface concentration distribution of active boron atoms and junction depth (d) were measured by electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV, CVP-21) profiling after removing wrap-around polysilicon. To evaluate the passivation perfor - mance of different textures, five pieces were randomly selected from each group solar cells before screen printing as lifetime samples. The effective minority carrier lifetime (  eff ), saturation current density (J 0 ), and implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ) of lifetime samples were extracted from quasi-steady state photoconductance lifetime measure - ment data (Sinton, WCT-120). Photoluminescence (PL) results of life - time samples were used to indicate the passivation property and uniformity. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recognized at a spectral response measurement system. The valuable electrical pa - rameters, including PCE, open-circuit voltage (V oc ), J sc , filling factor (FF) and series resistance (R s ), etc., were measured with an in-line, light I–V and Suns-V oc  measuring instrument (Sinton, FCT-750). 3.Results and discussions 3.1.Surface morphology and optical property We fabricated multi-scale NPP structures with three kinds of feature sizes via different P RF . Fig. 2a–c presents the top-view SEM images of NPP surface at 10.0 K magnifications under the P RF  of 100 W, 300 W and 600 W, respectively, as well as the corresponding zoom-in SEM images of top view and cross-section view at 30.0 K magnifications. Compared with conventional micron-pyramid texture, the NPP structures reveal a hierarchical surface consisting of dense nanopores on top of random micron-pyramids and nanogrooves between micron-pyramids. Accord - ing to the SEM image luminance contrast shown in Fig. 2, it is obvious that nanogrooves are deeper and broader than nanopores because the V- shaped intersections between micron-pyramids were subjected to more physical sputtering and chemical etching. Fig. 2 gives clear evidence for different feature sizes under three P RF . Based on SEM results, we count and calculate the simplified geometry parameters of NPP structures at different P RF , including the average nanopore diameter (D), nanogroove width (W), nanogroove projection proportion (C), nanopore depth (D p ) and the enhanced specific surface area ratio (A F /A proj ) [14], as listed in Table 1. Herein, A F  represents the front surface area, A proj  represents the corresponding projection area. As shown in Table 1, when the P RF  increases from 100 to 600 W, the average width of nanopores increases from 223 to 268 nm, the average width of nanogrooves increases from 360 to 470 nm, and the average depth of nanopores increases from 204 to 277 nm, indicating that wider and deeper nanostructures were formed at higher P RF . This is because the increased P RF  accelerates the ionization of O 2 , Cl 2  and SF 6  as well as physical sputtering of reactive ions and energy-enhanced free electrons [27,31]. Meanwhile, the zoom-in images at cross-section view shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the surface flatness of NPP structures at the P RF  of 600 W is smoother than that of 100 W and 300 W, which is likely that the sharp and highly reactive structures formed previously were removed from the surface. To comprehensively investigate the optical properties of NPP struc - tures at different P RF , we measured the reflectance and transmittance spectra in the wavelength region of 300–1180 nm and calculated the absorptance spectra according to Equation (4), as shown in Fig. 3a–c. Then, the averaged solar spectral values of reflectance (R ave ), trans - mittance (T ave ) and absorptance (A ave ) were calculated by the following Expression (5) ~ (7) and inserted in Fig. 3, taking conventional micron- pyramid structure as a reference.

As shown in Fig. 3a and c, all NPP structures (R ave  ≤6.84%, A ave  ≥77.4%) achieve a notably light-trapping capability over a wide spectral range from 300 to 1050 nm compared to micron-pyramid structure (R ave  ~ 9.37%, A ave  ~ 75.3%). An equivalent medium layer (EML) with graded refractive index distribution was formed between the air and the silicon substrate [32], because the feature sizes of NPP structures are compa - rable to or smaller than the incident light wavelength, especially the short-wavelength. The EML effectively enhances light scattering [33], and improves short-wavelength response of silicon wafers in the spectral range of 300–400 nm as shown in Fig. 3a. Meanwhile, the absorptance spectra of NPP structures show a redshift compared with that of micron-pyramid textures, owing to the EML suppressing the strong reflection originated from the refractive index dispersion effect of silicon substrate [34–36]. Fig. 3b shows that the long-wavelength trans - mittance of NPP structures is slightly higher than that of micron-pyramid structure due to its thinner wafer thickness after RIE etching and BOE cleaning. Besides, the transmittance of NPP structures at different P RF  shows little difference. According to the structure parameters of NPP textures in Table 1, the increased width of nanopores and nanogrooves at higher P RF  reduces the action spectra range of EML, thus, to the detriment of antireflection. Paradoxically, the increased etching depth at higher P RF  enhances the reflection times of incident light, beneficial for light-trapping. As shown in Fig. 3c, the R ave  of NPP textures decreases from 6.84% to 6.22% when the P RF  increases from 100 to 300 W, which indicated that etching depth plays a dominant role in antireflection capability. However, when the P RF  increases from 300 to 600 W, the R ave  increases from 6.22% to 6.76%. This is because, although etching depth is still increased, the feature size of some nanogrooves is larger than 500 nm, no longer ful - filling the zero-order condition of EML [37]. 3.2.Emitter passivation properties The difficulty of integrating RIE b-Si textures into solar cell pro - duction lies in severe Auger recombination and surface Shockley-Read- Hall (SRH) recombination of photo-generated carriers, caused by high surface doping concentration (N s ) and high A F /A proj  of nano-structured surfaces, respectively. In order to suppress Auger recombination, the doping characteristics of NPP emitter based on the P RF  of 100 W were investigated and discussed by appropriately adjusting process parame - ters, including oxygen flow rate, drive-in temperature, and oxidation time during boron diffusion. Fig. 4a shows the ECV curve of NPP emitter with an optimized boron diffusion (OPB) process (red), taking baseline diffusion process on NPP texture (blue) as reference. Compared with NPP emitter with baseline diffusion process (N s  ~ 5.92 ×10 19  cm �3 , d ~ 0.7   m), that with OPB process exhibited a reduced N s  peak (~1.35 ×10 19  cm �3 ) and an increased d length (~1.26   m) because of the internal diffusion of boron atoms in a longer in-situ oxidation time [38]. Fig. 4b compares the average J 0  of NPP cells before screen printing in OPB process (J 0  ~ 50.4 fA/cm 2 ) and baseline diffusion process (J 0  ~ 61.1 fA/cm 2 ) under the same solar cell manufacturing. For both emitters coated with the same stacked surface passivation layer, the improve - ment J 0  of NPP cells in OPB process are evidently originated from lessened Auger recombination. Besides, supplement Fig. S1 and Table S1 show the ECV profiles, J 0  and I–V parameters of NPP cells with another boron diffusion process, which is not used as the final boron diffusion process due to higher contact resistivity and lower FF despite exhibiting more excellent J 0  and V oc  than the OPB process. Finally, in this paper, the OPB process was applied in all samples at different P RF . Fig. 4c and d shows the ECV curves and R sheet  of NPP emitters, respectively, which afford data support to analyze and quantify emitter recombination evolution with different P RF . First, all NPP emitters possess higher N s , d and lower R sheet  than micron-pyramid emitter because NPP emitters with a high A F /A proj  enhance the adsorption and doping of boron atoms in boron diffusion process [3,39]. For NPP emitters formed by RIE, the lower N s , shallower d and increased R sheet  with P RF  indicate that larger feature sizes and smoother surface can slightly improve the doping characteristics. To achieve a high PCE of solar cells, the high-quality surface passivation is critical to prevent unwanted photo-generated carrier recombination occurring on the NPP surface. Supplement Figs. S2–S4 show some attempts on adjusting the passivation technique to find the suitable solution for the nano/micro silicon surface. In this work, the stacked ALD-Al 2 O 3 /PECVD-SiN x  dielectric layer was finally selected to passivate NPP emitters because it combines excellent chemical passiv - ation with field-effect passivation (negative fixed charge density) on p- type silicon surface [40]. Fig. 5a shows the   eff  as a function of excess carrier density (n) for double-sided polished silicon wafers covered  Fig. 3.Evolution of (a) reflectance, (b) transmittance and (c) absorptance spectra of NPP wafers from 300 to 1180 nm at different P RF .

Xu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        with the Al 2 O 3 /SiN x  stacked films. The average   eff  (2667   s) and the maximum   eff  (5124   s) of symmetric lifetime samples at n =1 ×10 15  cm �3  confirm its excellent surface passivation capability. And this stacked passivated layer was applied in all solar cells at different P RF .

Xu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        from 100 to 600 W, the average of   eff  at n =1 ×10 15  cm �3  increases from 548 to 682   s, and the extracted J 0  decreases from 50.7 to 44.5 fA/cm 2 , which suggest that higher P RF  can adequately improve the passivation quality of NPP structures. As described above, the feature sizes and morphologies of NPP structures affected by different P RF  have an effect on the boron emitter doping concentration and the interface defect state density, which ul - timately determines the amount of emitter Auger recombination (J 0e, Auger ) and surface SRH recombination (J 0e, surface ) [41], respectively. Therefore, analyzing the occupation ratio of different recombination channels in NPP emitters can provide guidance for optimizing the preparation process of NPP solar cells. Based on the measured ECV profiles and J 0  extraction values, we disassemble the J 0e  of NPP emitters and conventional micron-pyramid emitters into J 0e, auger  and J 0e, surface  using ENDA 2 software [42], as shown in Fig. 5e. Note that the recom - bination channels of radiative (band-to-band) recombination and bulk SRH recombination were not plotted in Fig. 5e because they accounted for too little. On the one hand, the J 0e, surface  of NPP emitters (21.8–23.6 fA/cm 2 ) at different P RF  have little difference and can be comparable to that of micron-pyramid emitter (20.1 fA/cm 2 ), which confirms the excellent surface defect passivation of the Al 2 O 3 /SiN x  stacked layer on NPP textures. Among them, the lowest average J 0e, surface  of NPP emitter was obtained at the P RF  of 600 W, about 21.8 fA/cm 2 , indicating the benefit of larger feature sizes and smoother surface for surface passiv - ation. As shown in Fig. 5d, the cross-sectional SEM image reflects the good conformality of the stacked passivation layer, which is essential for surface passivation on NPP structure. On the other hand, due to the heavy doping effect of nanostructures, the average J 0e, Auger  of NPP emitters (14.9–19.6 fA/cm 2 ) at different P RF  are 99%–161% larger than that of micron-pyramid emitters (7.5 fA/cm 2 ). Meanwhile, when the P RF  increases from 100 to 600 W, the J 0e, Auger  of NPP emitters decreases from 19.6 to 14.9 fA/cm 2 , a drop of 24%, suggesting that the reduction of boron dopant caused by larger feature sizes effectively suppresses J 0e, Auger  as expected. In summary, the difference of emitter passivation between NPP cells and micron-pyramid cells is mainly reflected in J 0e, Auger . At the same time, the J 0e, surface  over 20 fA/cm 2  still dominates the J 0e  of NPP cells. Therefore, preparing the selective emitter, optimizing the boron diffu - sion process, and adjusting passivation technique to match NPP struc - tures are the following research directions. Fig. 5f shows the PL luminescence intensity images of NPP cells at different P RF  before screen printing. The color difference of PL images characterizes local passiv - ation in detail, and the PL mean values reflect global passivation quality. The positive relevant relationship between the PL mean value and the P RF  is coincident with passivation parameters measured by WCT-120. 3.3.Cell performance To illustrate the broadband spectral absorption capability of NPP structures at the device level, Fig. 6a shows the EQE and reflectance spectra of NPP cells at different P RF  from 300 to 1200 nm, together with conventional cells. Firstly, the reflectance of NPP cells in the short wavelength range of 300–450 nm is significantly lower than conven - tional cells, attributed to the formation of an EML as mentioned above. Secondly, the EQE of NPP cells in the short wavelength of 300–500 nm and medium-long wavelength of 700–1000 nm is higher than conven - tional cells, showing excellent broadband spectral response capability, beneficial to improving the J ph  of solar cells. Unlike silicon wafer, the non-trivial transport and recombination losses of incident light in NPP cells are more complicated. Based on the optical loss model proposed by Bertrand et al. [43] and the measured EQE and reflectance data, the various optical loss paths were quantified, as shown in Fig. 6b. Con - cerning the front-side reflection loss, NPP cells (0.79–0.85 mA/cm 2 ) exhibits an improvement above 0.4 mA/cm 2  than conventional cells, corresponding to the results of EQE and reflectance in Fig. 6a, which confirms the strong antireflection capability of NPP structures. In addition, Fig. 6b reveals that the poly-Si/SiN x  parasitic absorption ac - counts for a large proportion of optical loss of a TOPCon cells. This can be reduced by reducing polysilicon thickness, but not completely elim - inated. For NPP TOPCon solar cells, a higher light trapping at longer wavelengths helps to mitigate the parasitic light absorption in poly - silicon layer. Hence, forming NPP textures could give us more flexibility with the thickness of the polysilicon layer. The average current-voltage (I–V) electrical parameters of NPP cells are summed up in Table 2, together with conventional cells. The average V oc  of NPP cell at the P RF  of 600 W is more than 1–2 mV higher than those at the P RF  of 100 W and 300 W, which reveals passivation gains from larger feature sizes and smoother surface. The average J sc  of all NPP cells is greater than 41.43 mA/cm 2 , almost 2.8 mA/cm 2  higher than that of conventional cells (41.15 mA/cm 2 ), demonstrating the strong light-trapping capability of NPP structures on front surface. Further - more, the average FF of NPP cells (>81.55%) is above 0.31% higher than that of conventional cells (81.24%) due to the lower metal-silicon con - tact resistivity (  c ) formed by the heavy doping effect by NPP structures. The FF of NPP cells increases from 81.55% to 81.69% when the P RF  increases from 100 to 600 W because of the higher passivation quality at higher P RF  [44]. Altogether, the NPP cells at the P RF  of 600 W showed the highest average PCE (23.55%) compared with that of 100 W (23.48%), 300 W (23.45%) and conventional cells (23.37%). The high PCE of NPP cells at the P RF  of 600 W is derived from the appropriate surface morphology and feature size, which realizes a tradeoff between optical gain and recombination loss associated with NPP structures, that  Fig. 6.(a) The EQE and reflectance spectra as a function of wavelength.

A champion NPP cell was obtained on a full 252.02 cm 2  wafer area at the P RF  of 600 W, reaching a V oc  of 700.0 mV, an FF of 81.86%, an J sc  of 41.51 mA/cm 2 , and a front PCE of 23.79%. 3.4.Wide-angle antireflection property The angle dependence of spectral response capability of solar cells directly affects the total power generation of photovoltaic modules in all-weather working conditions when photovoltaic modules with fixed installation angle receive sunlight from different angles for one day due to the earth rotation. Here, the NPP cells at the P RF  of 600 W are selected to illustrate high-efficiency solar spectrum absorption performance for a wide  because they exhibit better photoelectric properties. Fig. 7a and b shows the EQE spectra of NPP cells and conventional cells with increasing  from 0 ◦ to 70 ◦ , respectively. The EQE spectra of NPP cells decreases slowly with increasing , which benefits from spectral response independent of the direction of incoming light that EML brings [6]. Differently, the EQE spectra of conventional cells drop dramatically with increasing , showing a strong angle sensitivity. This is because the micron-pyramids and anti-reflectance layers was mainly optimized and designed for reducing optical reflection in normal incident light. Fig. 7c shows the relative change in J sc  of NPP cells and conventional cells versus normal illumination as a function of . When the  is less than 20 ◦ , changes in J sc  between NPP cells and conventional cells are almost overlapped. When the  is increasing to 70 ◦ , changes in J sc  of NPP cells are under 4.5%, whereas conventional cells lose up to 7.4% in the same condition, which fully demonstrates the superior light-trapping capa - bility of NPP cells over broad . During working in the outdoor envi - ronment, it is significant that NPP cells can generate higher total power and energy than conventional cells. 4.Conclusions In summary, we have successfully demonstrated the high-efficiency NPP bifacial TOPCon solar cell with the highest PCE of 23.79% by integrating the RIE b-Si technique into industrial solar cell production. In this work, to ascertain the appropriate feature sizes and surface morphologies, we have systematically studied and analyzed the effects of different P RF  on photoelectric properties of NPP cells. Meanwhile, to further suppress a large amount of surface recombination and Auger recombination originated from NPP structures, the optimized boron diffusion process and high-quality stacked Al 2 O 3 /SiN x  layers were dis - cussed. As a result, the larger subwavelength size of nanopores (~270 nm) and nanogrooves (~470 nm), and smoother surface were formed at the P RF  of 600 W, which notably promotes the emitter passivation quality (J 0e  ≤36.7 fA/cm 2 ) while maintaining the strong light-trapping capability (J sc  ≥41.44 mA/cm 2 ). Besides, the EQE spectra results for several  show that the relative changes in J sc  of NPP cells are under 4.5% for a wide  up to 70 ◦ , exhibiting excellent wide-angle absorption capability and great application potential. This work should pave the way for the RIE technique in high-efficiency industrial TOPCon solar cells. CRediT authorship contribution statement Cheng Chen: Conceptualization, Methodology.

The incorporation of CSCs into  silicon solar cell contributes to cell efﬁ ciency (excellent surface passivation at both contact and noncontact regions resulting  in a high open-circuit voltage  V  oc , and simpliﬁ ed current ﬂ ow pattern resulting in a high ﬁ ll factor FF) as well as design ﬂ exibility, process robustness and a simpliﬁ ed process ﬂ ow by eliminating the local doping and contact opening steps. Ultra- high PCE of 25.1% and 25.6%, respectively, has been achieved  in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) and silicon heterojunction inter- digitated back-contact (SHJ-IBC) cells based on the intrinsic  a-Si:H/doped a-Si:H CSC. [ 2–4 ]  Recently, silicon solar cells fea-turing a tunnel SiO 2 /doped poly-Si CSC ( TOPCon ) at the rear have been achieved a remarkably high efﬁ ciency of 25.1%. [ 8 ]  Therefore, silicon solar cells based on CSCs have the potential  to achieve ultrahigh efﬁ ciencies in the not so distant future.  Although a-Si:H and SiO 2 -based CSCs have achieved great success in the development of high-efﬁ ciency silicon solar cells, there are some intrinsic challenges such as thermal instability  and parasitic photon absorption of a-Si:H ﬁ lms, complicated deposition process, and high fabrication cost. Moreover, the  doped a-Si:H layers are deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical  vapor deposition (PECVD), which is a capital-intensive system  with mandatory safety systems because of the pyrophoric silane  and toxic boron/phosphorous gas precursors employed. There- fore, it is essential to develop high quality CSCs that can be  deposited easily, economically, and safely with minimal haz- ardous risks.  Transition metal oxides (TMOs), which have been extensively investigated for charge injection and extraction in organic and  perovskite solar cells, [ 9 ]  have attracted considerable attention as alternative CSCs for silicon solar cells because of their ease  of deposition at a low cost (e.g., thermal evaporation, brush  painting, spin-on and spray methods). Sub-stoichiometric  molybdenum oxide (MoO  x  ), [ 10–13 ]  nickel oxide (NiO   x  ), [ 14 ]  vana-dium oxide (VO  x  ), [ 13 ]  and tungstate oxide (WO   x  ) [ 13,15 ]  have been investigated as hole-selective contacts for silicon solar cells. By  substituting the boron-doped a-Si:H with a thin MoO  x   ﬁ lm, a SHJ solar cell with a PCE of 22.5% has been achieved with  an improved short-circuit current density ( J  sc ). [ 12 ]  Recently, ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lm on crystalline silicon has been demon-strated to form a hole–blocking interface. [ 16,17 ]  This is due to a small conduction band offset (∆  E  c  ≈ 0.05 eV), which allows elec-trons to pass through the TiO 2  layer and a large valence-band offset (∆  E  v  ≈ 2.0 eV), which results in holes being blocked. [ 18 ]  A double-heterojunction silicon solar cell with an efﬁ ciency of 12.9% has been fabricated via the implementation of a hole- blocking TiO 2  layer. [ 19,20 ]  All of these observations suggest that   The main objective of technology development in the photo-voltaics industry is to increase the power conversion efﬁ ciency (PCE) and reduce production costs in order to reduce the cost/ watt. The standard p-type silicon solar cell with a homogeneous  n +  emitter and aluminum back surface ﬁ eld (Al-BSF) has a PCE limit of ≈19% with the current passivation and metallization concepts. A route toward higher PCE is the implementation  of selective emitter (SE) or/and local back surface ﬁ eld (LBSF) structures into silicon solar cells. State-of-the-art high-efﬁ ciency silicon solar cells (>23%), such as the passivated-emitter rear locally diffused (PERL) and passivated emitter with rear totally  diffused (PERT) cells, have been fabricated with locally doped  or/and contact regions at front or rear sides. [ 1 ]  However, the approach used to realize localized contact and/or doped regions  for PERL and PERT cells requires cost-intensive processes, such  as high temperature diffusion followed by complex patterning  processes (e.g., photolithography, inkjet mask formation, laser  processes), which have limited the commercial success of these  high-efﬁ ciency cell concepts.  An alternative approach to achieve high PCE silicon solar cell is via the implementation of carrier selective contacts  (CSCs). [ 2–8 ]  A contact which extracts just one-type of carrier (electron or hole) from absorber (e.g., silicon) is termed as a  CSC. A CSC is traditionally achieved by depositing a conductive  layer (e.g., doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a-Si:H) over  the thin passivation interlayer (e.g., intrinsic a-Si:H or SiO 2 ). For example, electron/hole-selective contacts can be formed  by a stack of tunnel SiO 2  and phosphorus/boron-doped a-Si:H layer. [ 3 ]  A high quality CSC not only provides excellent surface  Adv. Mater. 2016, 28, 5891–5897www.advmat.dewww.MaterialsViews.com 5892 wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim COMMUNICATIONTiO 2  thin ﬁ lms are potentially an excellent electron-selective contact for silicon solar cells. However, the carrier selectivity  characteristics of TiO 2  thin ﬁ lm are yet to be investigated, and the PCE of silicon solar cells with a full-area TiO 2  contact has not been fully explored to date.  In this work, we present high-efﬁ ciency silicon solar cells featuring a full-area electron-selective TiO 2  contact, which is deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The performance  of ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lms as an electron-selective contact is inves-tigated by considering both the surface passivation quality and  the contact resistivity on silicon surfaces. ALD is quite attractive  for thin metal oxide layer deposition, providing excellent con- trol over thickness and the ability to deposit pinhole free ﬁ lms. The results demonstrate that ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lms provide not only excellent passivation on silicon surfaces, but also allow a  relatively low contact resistivity at the Si/TiO 2  heterojunction. A remarkably high PCE of 21.6% is achieved on a silicon solar  cell featuring a full-area TiO 2 -based contact.   Figure    1  a shows the structure of n-type silicon solar cells with a full-area TiO 2  or SiO 2 /TiO 2  electron-selective contact at the rear side. The solar cells (2 cm × 2 cm) were fabricated on n-type FZ-Si wafers (1.0 Ω cm) with a thickness of ≈175 µm. The textured front side with random pyramids has a boron dif- fused  p  +  emitter, which was passivated by Al 2 O 3 /SiN   x   stack. The front ﬁ ngers were prepared by thermal evaporation of a Cr/Pd/Ag seed layer and subsequent electroplating of Ag. The  rear side features a full-area TiO 2  (4.5 nm) or tunnel SiO 2 /TiO 2  (1.2/3.5 nm) contact. This full-area contact allows a low process  complexity and a simple 1D current ﬂ ow pattern at the rear. A control cell with directly Si/Al contact at the rear side was fabri-cated for comparison.   The current density–voltage ( I – V ) characteristics of silicon solar cells with different rear contact structures under the  AM1.5 conditions are shown in Figure  1 b, and the photo- voltaic parameters of champion devices are summarized in   Table    1  . The control cell without a TiO 2 -based contact exhibits a moderate efﬁ ciency ( η ) of 17.6%, which is mainly limited by a relatively low  V  oc  (585 mV) as well as FF (78.2%). This can be attributed to a high recombination at the Al/Si surface (as  high as 10 6 –10 7  cm s −1 ) and a non-Ohmic contact between Al and n-Si. [ 21 ]  By insertion of a 4.5 nm TiO 2  ﬁ lm between Al and n-Si interface, the cell efﬁ ciency is signiﬁ cantly improved to 19.8%. All the solar cell parameters, especially the  V  oc  (from 585 to 638 mV) and FF (from 78.2% to 79.1%), are improved  obviously. This indicates that a reduction of carrier recombina- tion and contact resistance occurs due to the insertion of an  ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lm between n-Si and Al. A further efﬁ ciency improvement is achieved by inserting a tunnel SiO 2  (≈1.2 nm) Adv.

The champion device featuring a full-area SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact exhibits a high  V  oc  of 676 mV, a  J  sc  of 39.6 mA cm −2  and a FF of 80.7%, resulting in a very high  η  of 21.6% that represents an absolute efﬁ ciency gain of 4.0% com-pared with the control device. The champion cell batch (four  cells on one wafer) shows an average efﬁ ciency above 21.0%, a testament to the reproducibility of the silicon solar cells with  a full-area SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact (see Table S 1 , Supporting Infor-mation). The result demonstrates that the carrier recombina- tion and contact resistance at the rear side are further reduced  with the SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact. This very high  η  of 21.6% is the highest value reported to date for the silicon solar cell with a  simple and full-area TiO 2 -based selective contact.   Figure  1 c shows the  I – V  characteristics of the devices with and without TiO 2 -based contact in the dark. All the devices exhibit diode properties clearly. The devices with TiO 2 -based contacts exhibit a much better diode properties with a lower  saturation current density and higher rectiﬁ cation ratio in com-parison to the control device. This suggests a reduction of the  series resistance and interfacial recombination, and an increase  in the shunt resistance for devices with the TiO 2 -based contacts, consistent with the improved cell parameters shown in Table   1 . To further investigate the effects of the TiO 2  contact incor-poration on the photovoltaic properties, the internal quantum  efﬁ ciency (IQE) spectra of these devices were measured (Figure  1 d). All the devices show a very high IQE in the short wave- length range (300–800 nm), which demonstrates a low surface  recombination at the front side thanks to the excellent surface  passivation by Al 2 O 3 /SiN x  stack. In contrast, an obvious higher IQE in the long wavelength range (>800 nm) is observed for the device with a TiO 2  contact at the rear side. The improved long-wavelength response indicates a lower carrier recombi- nation at the rear surface due to the presence of a TiO 2  ﬁ lm. Insertion of a tunnel SiO 2  interlayer between the TiO 2  and n-Si interface leads to the best long-wavelength response, resulting  in an obvious increase of  V  oc  and  J  sc , and hence the efﬁ ciency. The calculated  J  sc  for the cell with a full-area SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact, obtained by integrating the product of external quantum efﬁ -ciency (EQE) and the air mass (AM) 1.5 spectrum and cor- recting for the approximate contact fraction, is proven to be 39.51 mA cm  −    2 , in good agreement with the measured  J  sc  value. The IQE spectra demonstrate that the efﬁ ciency improve-ment is achieved by reducing the carrier recombination at the  rear side due to the presence of a TiO 2  ﬁ lm or SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack.  A dramatic efﬁ ciency improvement in silicon solar cells has been demonstrated by the inclusion of a full-area TiO 2 -based contact. The efﬁ ciency improvement is mainly attributed to a reduction of surface recombination (resulting in a higher  V  oc  as well as  J  sc ) and contact resistivity (resulting in a higher FF) at the rear side, which indicates that the TiO 2 -based contact inserted between n-Si and Al not only serves as an effective  electron transporting layer, but also provides good surface pas- sivation on silicon surfaces. A detailed analysis of the surface  passivation of thin TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack on silicon surfaces is presented below.   Figure    2  a shows the injection level dependent effective life time ( τ  eff ) of n-type silicon wafers passivated by TiO 2  ﬁ lms with different thickness after forming gas atmosphere (FGA,  mixture of 95% N 2  and 5% H 2 ) annealing at 250 °C for 3 min, and the calculated upper limits of effective surface recombina- tion velocity ( S  eff ) values are shown together. An ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lm (2.5 nm) can signiﬁ cantly reduce the  S  eff  from 10 6 –10 7  (Si/Al contact directly) to ≈56 cm s −1 . As TiO 2  ﬁ lm thickness increases from 2.5 to 5.5 nm, the measured τ eff  (at the injection level of 10 15  cm −3 ) increases from 170 to 850 µs. The calculated  S  eff  reduces from 56 to 11 cm s −1  accordingly. Ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lms also can provide excellent surface passivation on p-type surfaces (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). The very low   S  eff  values achieved by a 5.5 nm TiO 2  ﬁ lm are comparable to the reported value for Si/SiO 2  interface. [ 22 ]  The results demonstrate that ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lms can provide excellent surface passiva-tion to silicon surfaces, which can be attributed to the forma- tion of Si–O–Ti bonding at the Si/TiO 2  interface [ 23 ]  as well as the potential negative charge density in the TiO x  ﬁ lm. [ 24 ]  There-fore, silicon solar cells with a full-area TiO 2  contact show an improved  V  oc  due to the reduced surface recombination at the Si/TiO 2  interface.   Although ultrathin TiO 2  can provide excellent passivation on silicon surfaces, the passivation thermal stability is only stable  at the temperature of up to 250 °C. The surface passivation Adv.

KGaA, Weinheim COMMUNICATIONperformance degrades rapidly at a temperature higher than 250 °C (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It might be caused by the phase transformation from amorphous to anatase of the  TiO 2  ﬁ lm at a temperature of ≥300 °C. Liao et al. reported that anatase phase was observed in TiO 2  ﬁ lm deposited at 300 °C by ALD. [ 24 ]  It is well known that amorphous TiO 2  ﬁ lms (as-deposited) are preferred for c-Si surface passivation, as they  may introduce fewer interface defects compared to crystalline  TiO 2  ﬁ lms. Additionally, the Si–O–Ti bonding at the TiO 2 /Si interface might be broken at a temperature higher than 250 °C. To form the front contact, unfortunately, n-type solar cells fea- turing a full-area TiO 2  contact have to be subjected to a ﬁ nal FGA annealing at ≥300 °C, which causes the TiO 2  passivation degradation at the rear side resulting in a lower  V  oc  (638 mV) than expected.  Inspired by the excellent surface passivation and thermal stability of SiO 2 /doped poly-Si CSC, [ 5–8 ]  a thermally grown tunnel SiO 2  (≈1.2 nm) is inserted between Si and TiO 2  ﬁ lm to improve the passivation thermal stability of TiO 2  ﬁ lm on silicon surfaces. The passivation quality of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks with different thickness of TiO 2  capping on n-type silicon surfaces (1.0 Ω cm) is also investigated by quasi-steady state photoconductance (QSSPC) measurements. Figure  2 b shows  the dependence of effective lifetime (at the injection level of  1 × 10 15  cm −3 ) of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack passivated n-type (1.0 Ω cm, 190 µm) silicon wafers on FGA annealing at different tempera- tures. As-deposited SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks exhibit a poorer surface passivation than that of TiO 2  ﬁ lm with the same thickness. It is interesting that the passivation quality improved signiﬁ cantly by FGA annealing at evaluated temperatures for SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks capped with a thin TiO 2  layer (2.5 and 3.5 nm). However, a gradual passivation degradation instead of improvement is  observed for SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack capped with a 4.5 nm TiO 2  layer. The best passivation quality with a lowest  S  eff  of 16 and 14 cm s −1  is achieved for SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks capped with 2.5 and 3.5 nm TiO 2  layer, respectively, after FGA annealing at 350 °C. Signiﬁ -cant passivation degradation is observed for all SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks when FGA annealing at 400 °C. The results demonstrate that SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks can also provide a good surface passivation on n-type silicon surface with a better thermal stability. Therefore,  silicon solar cells featuring a full-area SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact show a high  V  oc  value (676 mV) thanks to the stable passivation at the rear side during ﬁ nal FGA annealing at 350 °C.  The different passivation quality changes of TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks under FGA annealing might be attributed to the different passivation mechanisms. Instead of passivating  silicon surface by forming the Si–O–Ti bonding for sole TiO 2  ﬁ lm, the passivation of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks to silicon surfaces is considered to be achieved by a combination of chemical passiva- tion of SiO 2  and ﬁ eld-effect passivation of the TiO 2  ﬁ lm, which is similar to that of a-Si:H and SiO 2 -based CSCs. When the TiO 2  ﬁ lm is too thin, the ﬁ eld-effect passivation is deﬁ cient, and holes are not repelled enough from the interface. This results in  a low level passivation of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks with a thin TiO 2  cap-ping (2.5 and 3.5 nm), and a much better surface passivation is  achieved with a thicker TiO 2  capping (4.5 nm). FGA annealing can improve the chemical passivation of SiO 2  by the diffusion of atomic hydrogen to the SiO 2 /Si interface where it deacti-vates recombination centers. Therefore, the surface passivation improvement of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks by FGA annealing can be attributed to the improved chemical passivation of SiO 2 . How-ever, FGA annealing at high temperature will degrade the ﬁ eld-effect passivation of TiO 2  ﬁ lm due to the phase transformation from amorphous to the anatase. Yu et al. reported that an amor- phous TiO 2  layer with high tensile stress forms at the begin-ning of the deposition, which induces the nucleation of anatase  phase as the thickness of TiO 2  ﬁ lms increases. [ 25 ]  This indicates that the thicker the TiO 2  ﬁ lm, the lower temperature needed for the phase transformation from amorphous to the anatase. The  surface passivation of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stacks degrades at a high tem-perature (>350 °C) can be attributed to the reduced ﬁ eld-effect passivation of TiO 2  ﬁ lm due to the phase transformation.  We have demonstrated that ultrathin TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack can provide high quality surface passivation on n-type  silicon surface, and next we will investigate the contact resis- tivity ( ρ  c ) at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions. A structure (see Figure S3, Supporting Information) developed  by Cox and Strack [ 26 ]  was prepared to extract the  ρ  c  values. Most contacts with different thicknesses of TiO 2  ﬁ lms and diameters circular metal dots (0.5–10 mm) at the top exhibit Ohmic  I–V  behavior, which demonstrates that electrons can pass through  the thin TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  layers, and allows the extraction of  ρ  c  by ﬁ tting the curve of resistance versus top circle contact diameter.   Figure    3  a shows the dependence of  ρ  c  of n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions on TiO 2  ﬁ lm thickness before and after FGA annealing. The  ρ  c  between n-Si and Al without TiO 2  interlayer was measured by a transmission line method (TLM), [ 27 ]  and  ρ  c  was extracted approximately from an extrap-olation of resistance versus pad spacing. A relatively large  ρ  c  between 0.5 and 1.0 Ω cm 2  is obtained for the n-Si/Al contact, which can be attributed to a relatively large Schottky barrier  height (Φ B  0.7–0.80 eV) between n-Si and Al. [ 28 ]  The electrons have to pass through this large barrier before being collected by  Al, as shown in Figure  3 b. A thin interfacial dielectric inserted  between the semiconductor and metal can increase the carrier  extraction for optoelectronic devices through the reduction of  the Φ B  at the interface, [ 21,29 ]  which might be caused by a reduced metal-induced gap states occupation in the semiconductor  bandgap and hence Fermi level depinning. [ 30 ]  Due to a very small conduction band offset (≈0.05 eV) between Si and TiO 2  interlayer, [ 16 ]  the insertion of an ultrathin TiO 2  ﬁ lm (<4.5 nm) between n-Si and Al reduces the Φ B  to 0–0.2 eV (Figure  3 c) by assuming a conduction band edge of TiO 2  at ≈4.0 eV [ 16 ]  and a work function of Al at 4.0–4.2 eV, and hence the  ρ  c  values decrease to lower than 0.3 Ω cm 2 . In the meanwhile, due to a large valence band offset (>2.0 eV) at the n-Si/TiO 2  interface, which would block the holes from silicon to TiO 2  layer, the car-rier recombination at the interface is also suppressed. For the  same TiO 2  ﬁ lm thickness, n-Si/TiO 2  heterojunctions show a lower  ρ  c  than that of n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions. Although a tunnel SiO 2  insertion between n-Si and TiO 2  interface may not change the energy barrier height (Figure  3 d),  ρ  c  increases slightly due to the presence of tunnel resistance. The relatively  large  ρ  c  at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions might be attributed to the amorphous TiO 2  interlayer with a low conductivity. The cells featuring a full-area TiO 2  or SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact exhibit a low FF (<70%) before ﬁ nal FGA annealing Adv. Mater. 2016, 28, 5891–5897www.advmat.dewww.MaterialsViews.com 5895 wileyonlinelibrary.com© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim COMMUNICATION(see Supplementary Table 2, Supporting Information), because of a relatively high  ρ  c  at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  het-erojunctions. After FGA annealing, a much lower  ρ  c  is achieved at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions, which is almost one order of magnitude lower than that before FGA. A  minimum  ρ  c  of ≈0.02 Ω cm 2  is achieved at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions with a 2.5 nm TiO 2  ﬁ lm, which is comparable to the  ρ  c  obtained on a high quality n-Si/SiO 2 /phosphorus doped poly-Si heterojunctions. [ 31 ]  The reduced  ρ  c  at the n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions after FGA annealing might be caused by the composition change of TiO 2  interlayer, which will be discussed in the Experimental Sec- tion. Therefore, the implementation of a TiO 2 -based contact improves the contact resistivity at the rear side, resulting in a  reduced series resistance and hence a higher FF, which is con- sistent with the results shown in Table  1 .   We found that the parameters of the devices featuring a full-area TiO 2 -based contact, especially the FF, depend on a ﬁ nal FGA annealing signiﬁ cantly (also see Supplementary Table 2, Supporting Information). The champion efﬁ ciency shown in Table  1  is achieved by FGA annealing at 300 and 350 °C for cells with a full-area TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism involved, cross-sectional  images of Si/TiO 2 /Al and Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2 /Al contacts after FGA annealing were obtained under bright-ﬁ eld (BF) and high reso-lution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) conditions  and elemental maps were obtained by energy-ﬁ ltered TEM (EFTEM), as shown in Figure  3 e,f. In both contact structures,  an obvious aluminum oxide (AlO  x  ) with a thickness of 2–3 nm is observed between TiO 2  and Al interface. However, a very thin and non-obvious AlO  x   interlayer (≈0.5 nm) was observed in the TiO 2 /Al interface before FGA annealing (see Figure S4, Sup-porting Information). Due to the strong oxygen afﬁ nity of Al metal, aluminum atoms easily attract oxygen atoms from the  TiO 2  interlayer and a redox reaction occurs between Al and TiO 2  forming an interfacial AlO  x  . [ 32 ]  This interfacial AlO x  layer is assumed to be a nonstoichiometric, Al rich layer due to the  low  ρ  c  obtained for these devices. The composition of the TiO 2  layer, which is initially considered to be amorphous and stoi- chiometric, [ 16 ]  has been drastically changed to an oxygen-deﬁ -cient TiO 2−  x   phase with high concentration of oxygen vacancies. The elemental maps obtained by EFTEM also conﬁ rm that the titanium oxide interlayer (green color) becomes highly oxygen  deﬁ cient, and the oxygen concentration at the Al/TiO 2  interface is much higher, as displayed with the red color.  It is well known that titanium oxide shows a higher conduc-tivity as the concentration of oxygen vacancies increases. [ 30,33 ]  The effect of titanium oxide composition change on cell  parameters can be described in two aspects. First, the contact  resistivity at the Si/TiO 2  and Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions decreases due to a higher conductivity of titanium oxide with  high concentration of oxygen vacancies, and hence cell’s FF  improves. Agrawal et al. reported that high conductivity inter- facial layer is one of the key requirements to obtain low con- tact resistivity using metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS)  contact. [ 30 ]  Moreover, the coarsening of TiO 2  ﬁ lm during FGA annealing, which has been demonstrated by Yu et al., [ 25,34 ]  might be an additional reason for the reduced contact resistivity at the  Si/TiO 2  and Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions. The results are con-sistent with the reduced contact resistivity shown in Figure  3 a Adv. Mater. 2016, 28, 5891–5897www.advmat.dewww.MaterialsViews.com  Figure 3.    a) Dependence of contact resistivity of n-Si/TiO 2  and n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions on TiO 2  ﬁ lm thickness before and after FGA annealing; b–d) Bandgap alignments of the n-type silicon solar cells with different rear contacts (b) n-Si/Al; (c) n-Si/TiO 2 /Al; (d) n-Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2 /Al; e,f) The cross-sectional TEM images of (e) Si/TiO 2 /Al and (f) Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2 /Al contacts after FGA annealing.

KGaA, Weinheim COMMUNICATIONand improved FF shown in Table  1 . Meanwhile, the surface pas-sivation quality of titanium oxide on silicon surface degrades,  resulting in a reduced  V  oc  of the cells with a Si/TiO 2 /Al con-tact. Due to the excellent surface passivation of Al 2 O 3 /SiN  x   at the front and TiO 2  at the rear, an implied  V  oc  as high as 700 mV is expected for the cells featuring a full-area TiO 2  contact at the rear. However, a much lower  V  oc  of 638 mV is obtained, which can be attributed to a degraded surface passivation of titanium  oxide with high concentration of oxygen vacancies. The out-dif- fusion of oxygen in the TiO 2  interlayer can destroy the Si–O–Ti bonding at the Si/TiO 2  interface, resulting in a higher surface recombination, and hence a lower  V  oc . Fortunately, the reac-tion between TiO 2  and Al has only a slight effect on the surface passivation quality of SiO 2 /TiO 2  stack on silicon surface, but it signiﬁ cantly decreases the contact resistivity at the Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunction. A relatively high  V  oc  of 676 mV and FF of 80.7% have been achieved with a full-area SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact, due to the stable surface passivation and reduced contact resistivity at  the rear Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact during the FGA annealing.  In summary, we developed a high-quality, low-cost TiO 2 -based electron-selective contact for silicon solar cells. The  implementation of the TiO 2 -based contacts reduces the surface recombination and contact resistivity at the silicon and metal  interface simultaneously, resulting in a higher  V  oc  and FF for silicon solar cells. The champion efﬁ ciency of 21.6% has been achieved on the n-type silicon solar cell featuring a full-area  TiO 2 -based contact. This work highlights the high potential of TiO 2 -based contacts in future high-efﬁ ciency, low-cost silicon solar cells. Our ﬁ ndings also open up the possibility of devel-oping low-cost transition-metal-oxide-based carrier-selective  contacts for silicon solar cells.    Experimental Section   ALD-TiO 2  Film Deposition and Characterization : Thin TiO 2  ﬁ lms were deposited by ALD (TFS 200, BENEQ, Finland) with the titanium chloride  (TiCl 4 ) titanium precursor and H 2 O oxidant at a low temperature of 75 °C, and N 2  was used as the purge gas. The growth rate was determined to be ≈0.07 nm per cycle, and the cycle time was only 1.5 s. Thin TiO 2  ﬁ lms (2.5–5.5 nm) can be deposited within 2 min. To investigate the surface passivation quality of thin TiO 2  on silicon surfaces, symmetrical test structures were fabricated on (100)-oriented  n-type (1.0 Ω cm, 190 µm) and p-type (1.0 Ω cm, 250 µm) silicon wafers to allow injection-dependent lifetime measurement utilizing the QSSPC  technique. [ 35 ]  The wafers were chemical-polished and RCA cleaned followed by a short dip in diluted HF before TiO 2  ﬁ lm deposition. TiO 2  ﬁ lms with different thicknesses (2.5–5.5 nm) were deposited on both  sides of silicon wafers, and QSSPC measurements were performed  before and after FGA annealing. TiO 2  ﬁ lm thicknesses were determined from ellipsometry measurement by ﬁ tting polarized reﬂ ectance data of single side polished silicon wafers. Some of the samples were subjected  to a short thermal oxidation before TiO 2  ﬁ lms deposition. The oxidation was performed in a preheated quartz tube furnace at 700 °C for only 150 s in O 2  atmosphere, resulting in a tunnel SiO 2  thickness of ≈1.2 nm. The passivation quality of the TiO 2  and SiO 2 /TiO 2  layers was quantiﬁ ed in terms of the effective lifetime (τ eff ) and effective surface recombination velocity ( S  eff ), which is calculated from  τ  eff  by the expression: [ 21 ]   112effbulkeffSWττ=+   (1)  with  τ  bulk  being the  c -Si bulk lifetime and  W  the wafer thickness. Here the bulk lifetime can be set to inﬁ nity since a high quality FZ c-Si was used,  the calculated  τ  eff  is an upper limit value.   Device Fabrication : The  ρ  c  of Si/TiO 2  and Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2  heterojunctions with different TiO 2  ﬁ lm thickness was measured by the method developed by Cox and Strack. [ 26 ]  The structure, as shown in the inset picture of Figure  3 a, was prepared by depositing TiO 2  or SiO 2 /TiO 2  on the top side, following which Al/Ag metal stack circles with different diameters were evaporated through a shadow mask. An Ohmic  rear contact ( ρ  c  < 10 −4  Ω cm 2 ) was prepared using evaporated Al on a phosphorus diffused (≈60 Ω sq −1 ) rear surface, in order to minimize the resistance associated with the rear contact. Current–voltage ( I – V ) measurements in the dark were performed before and after FGA  annealing using a Keithley 2425 source-meter at room temperature. The   ρ  c  values were obtained by ﬁ tting the curve of resistance versus front circle contact diameter. The extracted  ρ  c  value mainly consists of the resistance of the Si/TiO 2 , Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2 , and TiO 2 /Al interfaces as well as the TiO 2  bulk resistivity.  Silicon solar cells featuring a full-area TiO 2  or SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact at the rear were fabricated on n-type c-Si wafers (1.0 Ω cm, ≈175 µm). After surface damage etching in alkaline solution, a mask SiN x  layer (≈100 nm) was grown by low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) on both sides. The cell area (2 cm × 2 cm) was then realized by photolithographically deﬁ ned mesa etch. Following alkaline-based  surface texturing and standard RCA cleaning, a boron diffusion was  performed in a clean quartz furnace, resulting in a p +  emitter with a sheet resistance of ≈120 Ω sq −1 . An Al 2 O 3 /SiN   x   stack, which was deposited by plasma ALD (Al 2 O 3  ≈20 nm) and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD SiN  x  , ≈50 nm), was used to passivate the front emitter. The rear TiO 2  contact was formed by depositing a TiO 2  ﬁ lm (4.5 nm) and evaporating an Al/Ag (20/2000 nm) stack. Cells featuring a  full-area SiO 2 /TiO 2  contact were subjected to a short thermal oxidation at 700 °C for 150 s for tunnel SiO 2  growth before TiO 2  ﬁ lms (3.5 nm) deposition. The front ﬁ ngers were prepared with photolithography in  combination with an evaporated stack of Cr/Pd/Ag (40/40/40 nm) that  was thickened with Ag electroplating. Finally, the cells were subjected to  a FGA annealing before cutting by laser for  I – V  measurements. A control cell without TiO 2  contact at the rear (Si/Al contact directly) was prepared together for comparison.   Device Characterization : The  I–V  characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Xenon-lamp solar simulator under standard 1 sun  conditions (100 mW cm sq −2 , AM 1.5 spectrum, 25 °C), which was calibrated using a certiﬁ ed reference cell from Fraunhofer ISE CalLab.  The EQE of the solar cells was measured using a Protoﬂ ex Corporation QE measurement system (QE-1400-03). The front-side reﬂ ectance measurements were taken using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/ VIS/NIR spectrophotometer. The IQE was calculated by the measured  reﬂ ectance and EQE data using IQE = EQE/(1 −  R ). Specimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were prepared by focussed ion  beam (FIB) technique with the help of FEI 200 TEM FIB. TEM studies of  Si/TiO 2 /Al and Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2 /Al contacts were carried out on FEI Tecnai F30 TEM operating at 300 kV. Cross-sectional images were obtained  under bright-ﬁ eld (BF) and high resolution transmission electron  microscopy (HRTEM) conditions. Compositional analysis was done with  the help of energy-ﬁ ltered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM).

The energy generation efficiency of bifacial modules is determined by both the front-side and the rear-side output power. In this study, we compared the IV parameters as well as field performance of different module structures to further realize the influencing factors dominating the energy gain of bifacial modules. Our results show that the glass/glass bifacial modules encapsulated with bifacial solar cells provide over 6% more energy yield compared to the glass/ backsheet monofacial modules encapsulated with regular monofacial solar cells. Due to optical enhanced effects of a reflective coating on the rear glass, the energy yield gain of bifacial modules can be increased to above 10%, even though the bifaciality factors were reduced from 72% to 64%. Our study indicates that enhancing the front- side output power of bifacial modules produces more benefits.    1.Introduction The solar cells with bifacial nature have long been regarded as an effective way to boost power generation by utilizing diffused, scattered and reflected light available to the rear side of field-deployed PV mod - ules assembled with such cells (Guerrero-Lemus et al., 2016). Compared to the standard monofacial PV modules, the regular backsheet is replaced by glass or transparent backsheet in fabrication of bifacial PV modules (Arihara et al., 2018). The back side of the solar cells harvests the albedo through the glass or transparent backsheet with an open metallization grid, which used to be considered as the inherent prop - erties of n-type solar cells. Nowadays the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) has become the prevailing technological approach dominating the PV industry (Dullweber et al., 2018), its passivation structure on cells backside also affords them to be made as bifacial cells to have the power output from the backside on module level. The energy yield gains of bifacial PV modules have been well investigated by researchers via the experimental and simulation studies (Asgharzadeh et al., 2018; Janssen et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2019). In general, installation parameters, such as tilt angle, clearance from the ground, albedo, affect the actual outdoor performance of the bifacial modules (Wang et al., 2015; Yusufoglu et al., 2014). As for the bifacial modules, the rear side power is the key parameter in determining the energy gains, and the index of bifaciality factor (Zhu et al., 2019) is usually used to evaluate the ability of getting extra gain of bifacial modules. Basically, bifaciality factor is an intrinsic property of the cell technology with rear side partially shaded, its module level magnitude is dominated by cell structures, however, different module designs can also lead to different module bifaciality factors with the same cells. Normally, the bifacial PV modules with the same front-side power and higher bifaciality factors could generate more electrical energy under the same system installation conditions due to the higher con - version efficiency of the back side. When developing the bifacial solar cells or modules, it is reasonable to pursue higher bifaciality factors. However, it should be noted that the way which leads to high output power of the rear side may reduce the output power of the front side. For example, in absence of the internal reflection through the backsheet, the front-side power of glass/glass bifacial modules will be lower than that of glass/backsheet monofacial modules due to the transmittance loss on cell-gap area (Singh et al., 2015). A reflective coating on the rear glass reported in the literature (Min et al., 2017) could improve the front-side power by enhancing optical performance of bifacial modules.

Few studies have discussed how to balance the front-side and rear- side power of bifacial modules during the design and manufacture of bifacial PV products. We have been studying the influence of different optical structures on the electrical performance, such as rated power and the bifaciality factors. The field performance of two types of bifacial modules and monofacial reference modules installed in a test field side- by-side are compared to better understand the energy yield of bifacial modules which is related to the electrical performance. The rear-side irradiance influence on bifacial modules is also investigated to further realize the energy gain induced by bifacial design. 2.Experimental 2.1.Bifacial cells and modules As shown in Fig. 1, p-type PERC cells have two types of electrodes on the backside, which lead to monofacial (Fig. 1a) and bifacial (Fig. 1b) schemes, respectively. Before the metallization, 156 ×156 mm 2  silicon wafers were processed following exactly the same process steps con - sisting of alkaline texturing, POCl 3  diffusion, passivation layers depo - sition on both sides and laser ablation on the backside (Wu et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019; Thorsten et al., 2016). Then the wafers were split into two groups. Group 1 were made into monofacial solar cells by screen printing full-Al paste on the rear side, while an open metallization grid (Kranz et al., 2016) was implemented on the rear side of the wafers in group 2 to achieve the bifacial structure, which enables the cells could absorb irradiance from both sides. All cells were tested and sorted under standard test conditions (STC, 1000 W/m 2 , 25  ◦ C) with the rear side covered by black sheet to prevent the absorption of the reflected light. We selected the cells in the same classification bin with the conversion efficiency of 20.6�20.8% from Group 1 and Group 2 for module fabri - cation, respectively. The monofacial solar cells were encapsulated into the glass/back - sheet modules. These regular monofacial modules (REG PERC) were used as the reference samples for the evaluations on the bifacial mod - ules. As shown in Fig. 2, the bifacial solar cells were integrated into two module structures: (1) Glass/Glass, (2) Glass/Glass (with lattice pattern on the rear glass). The bifacial modules with Glass/Glass (DG Bi-PERC) have the full-area transparent rear glass. A lattice pattern reflective coating, which is made of white ceramic on the rear glass, was adopted on the cell-gap area for another type of bifacial modules (DG Bi-PERC/ RC). The reflective coating line is 6-mm, which is wider than the stan - dard cell-gap of 2-mm. This design could make sure reflective coating fill in all cell-gap areas, even if there is a small alignment error between the cell strings and the rear glass during the lay-out process. Consequently, there was a 2-mm overlap between the reflective coating and the rear side of each cell, which resulted in the shading effect on the rear side of bifacial cells. I-V characteristics of finished modules were carried out under STC (1000 W/m 2 , 25  ◦ C and AM1.5G) with HALM module tester. During the I-V measurements of bifacial modules, the non-illuminated side of the bifacial modules was covered by a non-reflective black cover to ensure that there are no reflections from the test surroundings entering the non- illuminated side. By this method, the power of the front side and rear side could be measured independently. Then the bifaciality factors were defined by the ratio of the rear-side power and the front-side power of bifacial modules. 2.2.Field test system Three types of module strings, REG PERC, DG Bi-PERC, and DG Bi- PERC/RC, were mounted on the same rack next to each other in one of the outdoor testing fields in Yangzhou, China (N32 o 23 ′ ; E119 o 24 ′ ), and each array consisted of 11 modules. The modules were installed at 25 ◦ -tilt, facing south on cement paved ground. The energy generation data of the module strings were extracted from the grid-connected in - verters. Moreover, three single-module of each type were installed on the next rack to validate the data collected from module strings. The Multi-Tracer 5 system (MT5) was used to track the maximum power point for each module by the electronic load and collect their real-time IV data per minute under the real-operating conditions. The data collection resolution is 3 mV for voltage measurement, and 0.61 mA for current measurement. The testing accuracy of voltage and current are 0.1% for both 2 parameters. All racks were in a standard test field designed for regular monofacial modules. The installation conditions, such as the rack distance, module clearance were not practically opti - mized for bifacial modules. To monitor the in-plane irradiance, two pyranometers (Meteo Con - trol SR20-D2) were installed, one was parallel to the module front side, and the other one was installed parallel to the module rear side for al - bedo measurement. Blue�log X-3000 was used for the Data logger. Compact weather station (WS600-UMB) was installed for climate monitoring, such as temperature, humidity and wind speed. The outdoor data was obtained in a period of 22 months from July 2017 to April 2019. 3.Results and discussion 3.1.IV characteristics on modules Table 1 lists the average electrical parameters of three module types, totally 45pcs modules were tested, 15pcs for each group.

Yin et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    curves are demonstrated for DG modules. It can be seen that it has a big difference on the front maximum current (I mp, front ), which is the pri - mary cause differs the front maximum power (P mp, front ). Normally, the optical gain has the first importance to the current of solar device. The low I mp, front  of DG Bi-PERC modules is attributed to the transmittance loss on the cell-gap areas (Lopez-Garcia et al., 2019). By implementing the reflective coating on the rear glass, the incident light is scattered back at various angles and absorbed by the front side and rear side of bifacial cells in DG Bi-PERC/RC modules. A highest I mp, front  of 9.29A is achieved by the efficient light absorption. With regard to the REG PERC modules, the incident light between the cell-gap could also be scattered back due to the backsheet scattering and reflection properties. The scattering and reflection properties of reflective coating and backsheet have studied by researchers (Min et al., 2017). Because the scattered light of REG PERC module could only be absorbed by the front side of monofacial cells, the I mp, front  of REG PERC modules is lower than that of DG Bi-PERC/RC modules. The DG Bi-PERC modules have the lowest P mp, front  of 291 W within three module types due to the transmittance loss. The P mp, front  of 295 W for REG PERC modules is obtained by the internal reflection of the backsheet and the light absorption by the front side of monofacial cells. The P mp, front  of 300 W (~1.7% higher than REG PERC modules) is achieved due to the optical enhanced effects of the reflective coating applied in DG Bi-PERC/RC modules. Nevertheless, the reflective coating causes a shading effect on the rear side of bifacial cells, which decreases the rear maximum power (P mp, rear ) from 209 W to 192 W, then lowers the bifaciality factors from 72% to 64%. In today�s PV market, the sellable power is determined by the front- side rated power, even for the bifacial modules, and the rear side power act as a bonus to customers, thus many people focus a lot on the importance of module bifaciality factors. In this study, we detailed compare the field performance of different module types and investigate the influence factors on module energy yield to find the most feasible way on modules selection for PV power plant. 3.2.Comparison of accumulated energy The power plant is located in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, its sub - tropical monsoon climate, not too cold not too hot, with four distinct seasons. Fig. 4 presents the accumulated energy of three module types mounted in arrays and stand-alone system, respectively. Both the long- term field data collected from inverters and Multi I-V tracer clearly demonstrate that glass/glass modules with bifacial cells, DG Bi-PERC and DG Bi-PERC/RC, generate more energy than regular modules with monofacial cells, REG PERC. Side-by-side comparison shows about 6% gains on the energy generation by DG Bi-PERC modules in the past 22 months even with a slightly lower P mp, front  compared to REG PERC modules. The contribution of the rear side makes up the less output power of the front side and further brings more energy generation. The outdoor energy generation data also unequivocally show that incorpo - rating the rear glass with the reflective coating pattern into glass/glass modules with bifacial cells further boosts energy generation with over 10% energy gains compared to the REG PERC modules. It is reported that bifacial modules have 10�30% energy yield gains (Pelaez et al., 2018; Shoukry et al., 2016) compared to the regular monofacial modules. The energy yield gains vary according to the different installation conditions as mentioned above. In our study, all modules were installed on a large-scale concrete ground surface with the  Fig. 2.Schematic diagram of DG Bi-PERC and DG Bi-PERC/RC modules.

H.P. Yin et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    average albedo of 16.7% in the period of 2 years and the installation conditions were not optimized to harvest more reflected and diffused light for bifacial modules. Therefore, the energy yield gains of bifacial modules in this work are likely lower than most of reported results. It is in agreement with the lower energy generation in larger system caused by horizon blocking and large shadowing area of module rows (Asgharzadeh et al., 2018). 3.3.Comparison of performance ratio Performance ratio (PR) has been used widely to evaluate the field performance of PV modules, which was defined as the performance relative to STC power (IEC, 2017): ��= � � � � = ����/� � � � /� �,��� (1)  where Y f  is the final system yield, Y r  is the reference yield, E out  is the energy output, P 0  is the rated power of the array, H i  is the in-plane irradiation, G i,ref  is the irradiance at which P 0  is determined. Due to the complex installation conditions, and thus uncertain en - ergy gain of the rear side, the module manufactures could only measure and rate bifacial modules with illumination from the front side to set the sellable power for marketing. So we use the P mp, front  to calculate PR and evaluate the energy yield performance. Fig. 5 illustrates the accumu - lated PR comparison of three module types individually. As expected, double glass bifacial modules show much higher performance ratio due to extra collecting of diffused and scattered lights from module rear side. One remarkable result is that we see DG Bi-PERC/RC modules present comparable PR (100.8%) versus DG Bi-PERC modules (100.5%) even with lower bifaciality factors. This result indicates that the slightly shading on cell rear side and less module transparent have negligible influences on the energy generation of bifacial modules. We attribute this to the IAM benefits in the gap of solar cells with reflective coating. Light incident to the reflective coating can be scattered or reflected to both sides of the bifacial cells. At the high angles of incidence, there will be more internal reflection and less optical loss for the front-side irradiance. Fig. 6 presents brief diagrams of the paths of light (exclusive diffused light) in different module structures: (1) front incident light, (2) cell reflected light, (3) cell-gap transmitted light, (4) RC reflected light, (5) background reflected light. Besides the light path 1, 2 and 5, DG Bi- PERC/RC modules gains extra reflected light through the light path 4 thanks to the existence of reflective coating. With regards to the light path 3, researchers from NREL, SANDIA, etc. have conducted detailed sensitivity studies on the deployment height and light transmitted through the modules. They consider �with sufficient ground clearance (e.g. z >1 m), G rear  (rear side irradiance) is impacted only slightly by module transparent area��(Deline et al., 2016). In this study, the module center height to ground is 1.5 m (bottom to ground is 1.15 m) and the cell-gap is only 2 mm, thus the G rear  influence by transparent area could be negligible, which means the transmitted light through path 3 has little influence on the energy comparison between DG Bi-PERC/RC and DG Bi-PERC modules. The PR comparison results indicate that the bifacial modules have better power generation performance than monofacial modules with ~10% extra energy yield gains. With regards to two types of bifacial modules, enhancing the internal reflection in cell/string gaps leads to a higher P mp, front  and comparable PR value, even though the bifaciality factors are reduced. It is prefer to choose the DG Bi-PERC/RC modules in the investment of PV power plant, as which could reduce the balance of system (BOS), as well as the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) because of the higher energy output density of each module. In Fig. 7, we see there is a very strong seasonal variation of the performance ratio of all the modules. Basically, modules present higher PR in winter while lower in summer, which can be ascribed to the adverse effect of temperature influence on module performance. In addition, we observe that DG Bi-PERC/RC modules present obvious higher PR value than DG Bi-PERC modules in the month of Jan 2018 and Feb 2019. The common point of these two months is the weather con - dition rich of cloudy and snowy days, DG Bi- PERC/RC module show even better performance at such days due to better response on diffused light. We will further compare the module performance under different weather conditions in the next paragraphs. 3.4.Effect of irradiance The energy yield gains of bifacial modules are highly related to the rear-side irradiance (Zhu et al., 2019). We investigate the characteristics of module rear irradiance in this study. Fig. 8 illustrates the irradiance distribution at the rear side of a module string at different times during a  Fig. 4.Energy yield comparison of three module types in two monitoring systems: (a) Module strings connected to Inverters, (b) Individual modules monitored by Multi I-V Tracer.  Fig. 5.Accumulated PR comparison of three module types.   H.P. Yin et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    given cloudy and sunny day. A portable Newport 91150V with cali - brated reference solar cell was used to test the front and rear irradiance at different positions of a module string (110 points per string). Nine points (3 ×3) on the rear side of each module spreading over from top to bottom and left to right, as well as one point on the front side were measured. The ratio between rear and front irradiance (R) was used to represent the level of rear irradiance at each point. The non-uniformity of rear irradiance is defined as: �������������= �������������+����(2) As can be seen in Fig. 8, the irradiance behind the rear side of module strings is inhomogeneous due to the shading effect of modules (Zhang et al., 2019) and depends greatly on the weather conditions. The nonuniform backside irradiance will cause the mismatch loss of the output power for bifacial modules (Wang et al., 2019). On the rear side of module string, the irradiance distribution keeps changing at different time as the movement of sun azimuth and zenith angle. The nonuni - formity is ~28% on cloudy day, which is better than that of ~33% on sunny day due to the increased shading effects (morning sunlight from rear side leads to higher nonuniformity of ~49% due to the direct shading of other strings in test field). This property makes it highly difficult to predict the energy yield of bifacial modules from the rear side, even though the rear side power has been measured under STC. The energy gains of bifacial modules vary both on a daily and sea - sonal basis, due to increased air mass at sunrise and sunset compared to noon, and in winter compared to summer. Fig. 9 demonstrates the current comparison of three module types and the current ratio of bifacial modules versus regular PERC modules under specific weather conditions: (a) sunny winter; (b) cloudy winter; (c) sunny summer; (d) cloudy summer; (e) sunny day after snow. Table 2 lists the detailed in - formation of energy yield gains of bifacial modules versus monofacial modules, as well as the accumulated irradiance of each day measured by the pyranometers. The energy yield gains of bifacial modules are primarily related to the rear irradiance ratio affected by solar altitude and weather condi - tions. The dynamic changes of solar altitude in seasons lead to different rear irradiance ratios for the fixed module tracks. On the sunny day, the rear irradiance ratio could reach to ~20% due to the increased reflection area at large solar altitude angles in summer (Chieng and Green, 1993). The rear irradiance ratio decreases because of the shading effect at relatively small solar altitude angels in winter. On the cloudy day, it has comparable rear irradiance ratio between summer and winter.

Yin et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    the rear irradiance is dominated by the diffused light which is less dependent on solar altitude instead of the reflected light. It can be seen that DG Bi-PERC/RC modules have 3% ~ 4% absolute value of energy yield gains higher than DG Bi-PERC modules in the above all weather conditions. We attribute this to the domination of the front side output which is scarcely influenced by the rear irradiance. On the sunny day after snow, bifacial modules present extremely better performance than regular monofacial modules due to the ability of snow melting. Fig. 9(e) depicts the energy curves of different modules under a sunny day after a heavy snow, which perfectly demonstrates this advantage. Before 9:30 am, the output power of bifacial modules was dominated by the rear side contribution. DG Bi-PERC module shows higher current because of the higher bifaciality factors compared to DG Bi-PERC/RC module. Once the snow began to melt after then, the cur - rent of DG Bi-PERC/RC module raises faster than that of the DG Bi-PERC module due to the optical enhanced effect of reflective coating. The speed of snow melting has been greatly enhanced by better utilizing of the front side irradiance. To better understand the relationship between the energy yield gains and the rear irradiance ratio of bifacial modules, we plot the daily en - ergy gains as a function of the daily rear irradiance ratio as depicted in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the energy yield gains of bifacial modules are linear with the rear irradiance ratio. DG Bi-PERC/RC modules with reflective coating present obvious higher energy gain than DG Bi-PERC modules caused by higher front side power due to optical enhance effect. The slight shadowing of the reflective coating on the edges of backside of cells has a negligible effect on the extra energy gain yielded by the DG Bi-PERC/RC modules in comparison with DG Bi-PERC modules. In addition, the slope should be related to the bifaciality factors, and there is no obvious difference be - tween two types. With regarding to the discussion on the nonuniformity of rear irradiance and the influence of weather conditions, we can conclude that the bifaciality factors in a certain range is not a key factor of outdoor performance of bifacial modules due to the insufficient uti - lization on the rear irradiance. Combining with the comparison results of performance ratio, putting the front-side power first rather than bifaciality factors is profitable for both modules venders and PV power plant developers. As for the bifaciality factor, there are several ways to elevate it for modules. On cell level, reducing the finger width or increasing the roughness on backside surface will increase the short circuit current for the rear side, then leads to higher bifaciality factors. But these ways may affect the front-side performance due to the degradation on the fill factor or the open circuit voltage. On module level, the fully transparent rear glass leads to higher bifaciality factors, but the lower front-side power and energy yield compared to the rear glass with latticed pattern. In our opinion, the effectively utilization of front side irradiance is more important. It�s better to increase the bifaciality factors without sacri - ficing the front side output power during developing bifacial PV mod - ules. Quantitative analysis is beyond the scope of this work and will be discussed in a future study. 4.Conclusions Two types of bifacial modules have been studied in comparison with monofacial modules on their electrical performance and energy yield in this work. The glass/glass bifacial module has about 1.4% lower front- side power compared to monofacial reference module due to the opti - cal loss in cell-gap area. Appling the lattice pattern on the rear glass boosts the front-side power by about 1.7%, but lowers the bifaciality factors by about eight percentages from 72% to 64%. The energy yield gain of glass/glass bifacial module is about 6% during the period of investigation. However, it can be increased to above 10% with optical enhanced effects of the reflective coating on the rear glass. The study on the irradiance reveals that bifacial modules with reflective coating present better energy yield performance under different weather conditions. When developing or manufacturing bifacial PV modules, we suggest increasing the front-side power as the first priority, then the bifaciality factors, especially in the utility scale application.

The quality of passivation of the tunnel oxide layer clearly depends on the bond of SiO in the tunnel oxide layer, which is affected by the subsequent annealing and the tunnel oxide layer was formed in the suboxide region (SiO, Si2O, Si2O3) at the interface with the substrate.In the suboxide region, an oxygen-rich bond is formed as a result of subsequent annealing that also improves the quality of passivation.To control the surface morphology, annealing profile, and acceleration rate, an oxide tunnel junction structure with a passivation characteristic of 700 mV or more (Voc) on a p-type wafer could achieved. The quality of passivation of samples subjected to RTP annealin g  at temperatures above 900°C declined rapidly. To improve the quality of passivation of the tunnel oxide layer, the physical properties an d thermal stability of the thin layer must be considered. TOPCon silicon solar cell has a boron diffused front emitter, a tunnel-SiOx/n+- poly-Si/ SiNx:H structure at the rear side, and screen-printed electrodes on both sides. The saturation currents Jo of this structure on polished surface is 1.3 fA/cm2 and for textured silicon surfaces is 3.7 fA/cm2 before printing the silver contacts. After printing the Ag contacts, the Jo of this structure increases to 50.7 fA/cm2 on textured silicon surfaces, which is still manageably less for metal contacts.This structure was applied to TOPCon solar cells, resulting in a median efficiency of 23.91%, and a highest efficiency of 24.58%, independently. The conversion efficiency of interdigitated back-contact solar cells has reached up to 26% by enhancing the optoelectrica l properties for both-sides-contacted of the cells.Key words: TOPCon Solar Cell, TOPCon solar cell fabrication, Production process of TOPCon Solar Cell, TOPCon cell efficiency progress,TCAD analysis of TOPCon solar cell   !""!#$$ % & #$$ %  �Å	 				    	 		 	 	!	 ""#$%% 		&	 '%%!%(&)*   	!	 + 	+  		+ 		 '*	 , 	 & 	 		       		   !""		# 	    !	## 	   $ !$	# 		# 	  	 	#%%  &%  % 		#	 &'()'(*+ 	"",,+"" # #		  	-.	 	%"" &	(/##0 	1	%%  &#	,2+3	%#  		 	(#%3 		  #	#	 	  	  %# 	%	&	(%# 				  		 3# 	# 	&1		 	(	 3#	   "" ##""%($ &3#     	 3%""&&%# #&"" # &	  #	##	(# #   	%%# %# 3	 #  	&% (#%3#	 		&%	#		  	( 0"" ""	%  #  -.	 ,'4'3""##	#		  	(%5#%0"" # %%  &%,)(6+	 37"" #%%  &%,*(4+""3""#	 % 	%""	8(	 &#		#	3	  		 	  	 	%  %	  (9""3#	 	&: 	 	 (5 	&3 	#&		  ""% %4)*(;)<4)*(;)34*4(;<4*4(;(0&3 H.

Process diagram of production of TOPCon Solar Cell17)we need a high-yield poly silicon deposition system. However, there are about three different techniques considered for large scale manufacturing: low pressure chemical vapor deposition �(LPCVD)9), plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD)10), inline atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD)11), and sputtering12). As far as the it knows, testing of continuous production of these deposition �systems for the photovoltaic industry is still in its infancy.  The third significant demand is the metallization to thin polysilicon film. High temperature screen printing is the industrial form of procedure. The challenge is to secure the thin tunnel-oxide/ �poly-Si layer from the annihilation of the firing-through paste at the elevated temperature. Firing from paste removes the �polysilicon thin layer and introduces Ag nanoparticles into �crystalline silicon that further enhance the saturation current Jo of the passivating contact region13). The saturation current density of the metal contacts was investigated about 35 fA/cm2.14) Polysilicon films with a thickness of more than 150 nm can �withstand firing from extreme heat, on the other hand these �polysilicon layers have a greater coefficient of absorption15) and initiate losses in absorption. Consequently, the development of appropriate pastes from metal is currently a challenge for the �photovoltaic manufacturing. Regardless of present confronts, �by the interpretation of the LCOE (levelized cost of electricity), n-type TOPCon cells are favorable contestants for mainstream �after PERC efficiency extend up to 23%16, 17). Current information introduces a recently produced TOPCon cell from Research and �Development section with a highest efficiency of 24.58% and an �open circuit voltage of 716.8 reported in journal of elsewhere, these elements are currently mass-produced by many companies18).2. Fabrication of TOPCon solar cells The construction assembly of the cell is demonstrated in Fig. 1. It constructs with boron emitter on front side and passivating connecting layer on back side, along with fingers on both sides pasted by screen-printed system to develop bi-facial solar cell. Low amounts of oxygen required for phosphorus doped wafers, �with a resistivity level of around 0.5 Ωcm to 1 Ωcm. The sequence of cell construction is shown in Fig. 2. In a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution the wafers are textured on both sides �with irregular pyramids. After RCA cleaning, using a boron �tribromide (BBr3) solution the boron emitter is created in a boron diffusion furnace. By a single side etching process using hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid (HF/HNO3) solution, the rear boron diffusion is removed. After cleaning with chemicals, a tunneling SiOx is thermally developed and a pure poly silicon layer (minimum partially poly-crystalline) is accumulated in a �LPCVD system. The pure poly-silicon is doped in a phosphoryl �chloride (POCl3) diffusion furnace consequently to transform into n+-poly-silicon. Additionally, etching process on single side is processed to eliminate the front side covered with poly silicon. The boron emitter is passivated with film of dielectric layer, subsequently additional RCA cleaning processed, that is �correspondingly work as a coating of anti-reflection layer. The back side SiOx/n+-poly-silicon layer is covered with PECVD SiNx:H. For metallization, an “H-metal contact” design by screen printed on both sides with 9 bus-bars, afterwards a rapid firing procedure with a highest temperature of around 760°C17).

Yet the  translation of the hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) window layer and copper-plated electrodes to a cost-eective and scalable  production-relevant context remains one of the largest roadblocks towards  mainstream adoption of silicon heterojunction technology. Here we  address the rst challenge by developing an industrial-scale high-frequency  plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition system with a minimized  standing wave eect, enabling the deposition of doped nc-SiOx:H with excellent electron selectivity, low parasitic absorption and high uniformity.  Next, we demonstrate seed-free copper plating, resulting in grids with a high  aspect ratio and low metal fraction. By implementing the doped nc-SiOx:H window layer, certied eciencies of 25.98% and 26.41% are obtained for  M6-size bifacial silicon heterojunction devices with screen-printed silver  electrodes and copper-plated electrodes, respectively. These results  underline the performance potential of silicon heterojunction technology  and lower the threshold towards their mass manufacturing.Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) technology is of great interest for next-generation commercial crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovolta-ics, thanks to its high power conversion efficiency (PCE), lean and low-temperature processing, low temperature coefficient and high bifaciality15. SHJ technology is also an ideal bottom cell for future ultra-high-efficiency silicon-based tandem devices. To date, the PCE of SHJ solar cells in the frontback contact and interdigitated back contact implementations has reached 26.81% and 26.7%, respectively, setting the world record for single-junction c-Si solar cells6,7. Nevertheless, the 26.81% efficiency was obtained on a mono-facial SHJ solar cell (instead of bifacial) with front fingers and transparent conductive electrodes prepared by a laser transfer process and reactive plasma deposition6,  Received: 21 January 2023Accepted: 29 September 2023Published online: 2 November 2023  Check for updates A full list of afiliations appears at the end of the paper.  e-mail: alison@sundrivesolar.com; eddyzhou@maxwell-gp.com.cn; xbyang@suda.edu.cn; xiaohong_zhang@suda.edu.cn Nature Energy | Voume 8 | December 2023 | 137513851376 those SHJ processes that enable the highest power conversion efficien-cies (PCEs), to large-scale manufacturing28.The second challenge relates to the high-cost metallization pro-cess for SHJ solar cells when using low-temperature silver (Ag) paste, featuring a relatively low conductivity and relatively high shadowing losses and contact resistivity29,30. Furthermore, terawatt photovoltaic manufacturing urgently mandates the search for alternatives to Ag due to its scarcity31. This explains the great interest in copper (Cu) plating as an alternative metallization process for SHJ solar cells, given its high conductivity and narrow finger shadowing29,32–34. However, it remains challenging to develop cost-effective Cu metallization with high reliability, due to the poor adhesion between a directly Cu-plated electrode and TCOs (for example, indium tin oxide, ITO) and the lack of techniques for selective deposition of the seed layer and stripping-free plating resist29.In this work we address both critical challenges by developing a large-size PECVD system with a very high frequency (27MHz, labelled here VHF1) for high-quality phosphorus-doped nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H(n), where n refers to n-type phosphorus doping) window layer deposition, demonstrating excellent uniformity in a production-scale chamber with a minimized standing wave effect, compared to that of a even-higher-frequency system (40MHz, VHF2). By the implementation of optimized nc-SiOx:H(n) window layers, a cer-tified PCE of 25.98% is achieved on a full-area M6-size bifacial SHJ device with screen-printed silver electrodes. The device with a nc-SiOx:H(n) respectively, both of which are not industrially compatible for mass production. The commercial success of high-efficiency SHJ technol-ogy remains impeded by challenges in the cost-effective translation to a production environment of several process steps, such as window layer deposition and metallization.For the first challenge, the large-scale deposition of passivating contact layers usually relies on plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) of (doped) hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films, enabling excellent passivation and good carrier selec-tivity, but invoking high parasitic absorption and a relatively high contact resistivity with the overlying transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), limiting the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), respectively8. To resolve these issues, much research effort has been devoted to replacing doped a-Si:H with doped hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H)9–11, or its alloys with oxygen (hydro-genated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) (refs. 12–15)) and carbon (nc-SiC:H (refs. 16,17)). For these films, PECVD systems with a very high frequency (VHF)18–23 rather than the standard radio frequency (RF, 13.56MHz) are usually employed, to increase the deposition rate and reduce ion bombardment (as a VHF promotes SiH4 gas dissocia-tion and decreases the electrical field intensity19,24–26). However, quite generally for PECVD systems, the size of the reactor chamber should be less than a quarter wavelength of the plasma to avoid interelectrode voltage inhomogeneities and poor uniformity of deposited films due to standing wave effects19,27. This challenge sets a limit to the translation of   ≥−Ω≈ ≥ η  ≈  	     ≥≥−Ω≈ρ− α  ­ ­­  ­­ 	−Ω  − 	−≥≈≈	  ≈Ω−≈  Ω≈−Ω≈−−−Ω Ω≈Ω−≈−Ω≈−−−Ω Ω≈Ω Ω≈−  ≥   −−Ω−−−Ω − 	≈Ω−−−Ω − ≈−−Ω  ≈ η ≥ Fig. 1 | SHJ solar cell structure and performance. a, Schematic of a rear-junction SHJ solar cell featuring a front side nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer as electron collector. b, Cross-sectional HR-TEM image of the front c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO contact stack.

Ultimately, together with the pro-prietary Cu-plated finger–busbar grids by SunDrive, the certified PCE is boosted to 26.41% on a M6-size bifacial device, thanks to a high Jsc of 40.8mAcm–2 and FF of 86.28%. This work demonstrates an industri-ally compatible strategy to integrate a high-performance nc-SiOx:H window layer with large-area uniformity and performance-enhanced Cu plating to SHJ solar cells, which can help accelerate the commercial success of SHJ technology.SHJ solar cell performance at different frequenciesThree optimized nc-SiOx:H(n) window layers with a similar thick-ness were deposited by PECVD under excitation frequencies of RF (13.56MHz), VHF1 or VHF2. For all, the optoelectrical properties and thicknesses of the nc-SiOx:H(n) layers were optimized (PECVD param-eters are shown in Supplementary Table 1), providing a boron-doped p-type nc-Si:H for hole collection at the rear and transition-metal-doped indium oxide (IMO) transparent electrodes at both sides (Fig. 1a). Rather than the widely used ITO, here we employed the newly developed IMO featuring a wider bandgap, higher carrier mobility and lower free car-rier absorption, as discussed in our previous work35. The deposition rate of the optimized nc-SiOx:H(n) layer under VHF1 is 0.13nms–1, which is made comparable to that under RF (0.131nms–1) and VHF2 (0.123nms–1) by tuning the gas flow and power density. Figure 1b displays the cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of the front c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO (the 'i' in a-Si:H(i) refers to intrinsic) stack on a textured c-Si sur-face, together with the diffraction patterns calculated from Fourier transforms of the selected areas. Only a few crystalline phases can be observed within the first few nanometres of the nc-SiOx:H(n) film, directly adjacent to the intrinsic a-Si:H(i) passivation layer, which can be considered as the crystalline incubation layer. After that, numer-ous microcrystalline zones appear in the nc-SiOx:H(n) film, extending towards the nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO interface, which is crucial in improving both the contact properties of the nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO interface and FF of the device. Compared to the diffraction patterns in area I (c-Si sub-strate) and area III (amorphous silicon), the diffraction pattern in area II suggests a mixed phase of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon, rather than a pure crystalline phase, which is likely due to the introduc-tion of oxygen. Figure 1c,d displays the certified current–voltage (I–V) curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE), respectively, of the best device featuring a nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer deposited under VHF1. By comparison, the photovoltaic parameters of the best devices under RF and VHF2 (in-house measurements) are listed together in Table 1. The device PCE increases with increasing excitation frequency, where a relatively lower PCE of 25.83% is obtained under RF. Under VHF1 and VHF2, comparable higher PCEs of 25.98% and 26.02% are obtained, respectively. The PCE enhancement at different frequencies can mainly be attributed to a lower parasitic absorption loss and contact resistivity caused by a higher crystallinity (Supplementary Table 1) with decreas-ing amorphous incubation layer thickness of the nc-SiOx:H(n) films under increasing frequencies, translating to improvements in Jsc and FF. Note that the devices under VHF1 and VHF2 exhibit a FF exceeding  the theoretical value predicted by Green’s formula36 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The main reason for this is that our devices, thanks to the excel-lent surface passivation, are limited by Auger recombination, resulting in a diode ideality factor of 2/3 (refs. 37,38) rather than 1 as assumed in Green’s formula. Given the high-quality nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer deposited under VHF1, in the following section we investigate the effect of VHF1 on the optoelectrical properties and large-area uniformity of  the nc-SiOx:H(n) as well as the device performance.We first investigate the effect of the nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness ranging from 8 to 28nm on the SHJ device performance, as displayed in Fig. 2. Note that all other layers were kept identical and no MgF2 anti-reflection layer was applied to these devices. With a thin nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer (8nm), the device shows a moderate average open-circuit voltage (Voc) and FF of η736mV and η81%, respectively, resulting in a moder-ate average PCE of η23.8%. The device parameters (especially the Voc and FF) increase significantly by increasing the nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness from 8 to 12nm, resulting in a champion PCE of 25.85% for a thickness of 24nm (Voc, 749.8mV; FF, 85.7%; and Jsc, 40.24mAcm–2). Beyond a thickness of 12nm, the improvements gradually diminish and ulti-mately saturate at thicknesses of 20nm; Jsc increases with increasing thickness from 8 to 16nm, followed by a gradual decrease for thicker nc-SiOx:H(n) films. These results indicate that SHJ device performance depends notably on the nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness, which will be further investigated in the next section.Figure 3a shows Raman spectra of nc-SiOx:H(n) films with dif-ferent thicknesses deposited on a glass substrate under VHF1. The absence of a clear crystalline peak near 520cm1 for the 8nm film indicates that an amorphous phase dominates the characteristics. With increasing film thickness, the amorphous peak intensity near 480cm1 decreases, whereas the crystalline peak emerges to satu-rate gradually for thicknesses of 20nm. This reveals that crystalline nucleation in the nc-SiOx:H(n) film starts after a few nanometres of amorphous incubation, adjacent to the a-Si:H(i) passivation layer, and that the crystalline fraction increases with thickness, consistent with the crystallinity (Fig. 3a, inset) obtained by fitting Raman spectra (Supplementary Fig. 2). Note that the crystalline phases observed at the a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n) interface in the HR-TEM image (Fig. 1b) might grow at the later stage of the nc-SiOx:H(n) deposition due to the hydrogen etching during the process. The contact resistivity (c) of the c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO heterocontact was measured by the Cox and Strack method39, using the inset structure in Fig. 3b. The c was extracted by fitting the trend of resistance versus front circular contact diameter (Supplementary Fig. 3), and the depend-ence of c on the nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness is shown in Fig. 3b. A high c of 109.8mcm2 is obtained on the structure with 8nm nc-SiOx:H(n), which is consistent with the moderate average FF of η81% of the device. Further increasing the nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness to 12nm results in a dramatically lower c, to 49.5mcm2, and c decreases monotonously with increasing thickness. The result indicates that contact properties of the nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO interface are suboptimal with only 8nm of nc-SiOx:H(n), which might be ascribed to the poor contact interface between the less-conductive amorphous phase and IMO11. With increas-ing nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness, the nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO contact interfaces are greatly improved as now increasingly conductive crystalline phases directly contact the IMO, as also observed in the HR-TEM image in  Fig. 1b. In addition, the trend of crystallinity with thickness is in good agreement with the c of nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO and electrical properties (FF and Voc) of the device featuring the nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer. This indicates that the crystalline phase in nc-SiOx:H(n) promotes vertical conduction across the nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO interface, resulting in a substantially lower c and increase in FF. In addition, the crystalline Table 1 | Photovoltaic parameters of SHJ solar cells with screen-printed Ag electrodes and nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer deposited under RF (13.56MHz), VHF1 or VHF2 Frequency (MHz)Voc (mV)FF (%)Jsc (mAcm2)PCE (%)RF749.5285.3640.3725.83VHF1749.8085.6940.4425.98aVHF2750.0985.6340.5226.02VHF1 and Cu plating750.2086.2840.8026.41aaCertiied by ISFH CalTec.

Further-more, the deterioration of c-Si/a-Si:H(i) surface passivation, which may happen due to bombardment damage during the TCO sputtering process40, can be mitigated with increasing nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness, which further contributes to a higher Voc with a thicker nc-SiOx:H(n) layer. The absorption, transmission and reflectance spectra; the optical bandgap of nc-SiOx:H(n) with different thicknesses; and the EQE, reflec-tance spectra and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of corresponding SHJ devices are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 4. As expected, the EQE for the device with a thicker nc-SiOx:H(n) layer decreases at short wavelengths (Supplementary Fig. 4f), which can be ascribed to a higher parasitic absorption in the 300–600nm spectral range (Supplemen-tary Fig. 3a), even though the nc-SiOx:H(n) layer exhibits a larger optical bandgap than the a-Si:H (Supplementary Fig. 4b). However, thanks to its intermediate refractive index, the increase in nc-SiOx:H(n) layer thickness (Supplementary Fig. 4e), as part of the front contact stack, is beneficial to a lower reflectance of SHJ solar cells, which in turn increases the EQE at 600–1,200nm for thicker nc-SiOx:H(n) layers. As a result, the trade-off between parasitic absorption loss and reflectance gain of nc-SiOx:H(n) leads to the slight thickness dependence of Jsc, as shown in Fig. 2c. ≥−Ω≈≥Ω≈−≈≥−≈≈≥≈≈≥ηρ ≥−≥≈Ω≥≥≈Ω≥≈−≥≥≈−≥≈≥≥≈ 	 	 	   	   ≥−≥Ω−α ≥−Ω≈−≥≈≥−≥≈−≥≈− Fig. 2 | Dependence of SHJ device parameters on the thickness of nc-SiOx:H(n) layer deposited under VHF1. a, Voc. b, FF. c, Jsc. d, PCE.

Nature Energy | Voume 8 | December 2023 | 137513851380 the film thickness and device PCE distributions under VHF1 are superior to those of VHF2, especially for samples located near the chamber corner. Photos of the experimental trays shown in Supplementary  Fig. 5 also demonstrate visually that the nc-SiOx:H(n) deposited at VHF1 shows a superior uniformity to that at VHF2. Although the champion PCEs are comparable under VHF1 and VHF2, the PCE distribution range under VHF1 (25.7–25.9%) is much narrower than in the case of VHF2 (25.3–25.9%), demonstrating a higher fabrication yield. The significant improvements in large-area thickness uniformity and PCE distribution under VHF1 are due to the minimization of the standing wave effect, achieved by reducing the plasma excitation frequency and optimized showerhead design. As a result, a large-size PECVD chamber under VHF1 is successfully developed for mass production, enabling the load-ing of 162 pieces of 210mm half wafers in one batch (Supplementary  Fig. 6), corresponding to a throughput of 14,400 pieces per hour and an annual production capacity of 600MW.To clarify the different uniformity values under VHF1 and VHF2, we calculated the normalized voltage distributions under VHF1 and VHF2 for different electrode shapes (Fig. 5), by solving partial differ-ential equations numerically with the finite element method using the commercial solver FLEXPDE (details in Supplementary Note 1). The  is defined as the non-uniformity degree of the voltage within the chamber ( α= V max −V min Vmax+Vmin × 100 %), where Vmax and Vmin represent the maximum and minimum voltage within the chamber. With a flat  electrode (Fig. 5a,d), the voltage distribution peaks at the centre, which suggests a higher plasma density and a thicker film at the cen- tre, displaying the typical standing wave effect. This is different from the discharge driven by a conventional RF (13.56MHz), in which the plasma density is usually higher at the radial edge of the electrode due to the edge effect41. The uniformity of the voltage distribution under VHF1 and VHF2 is ±27% and ±70%, respectively, both of which are very poor. As the plasma density increases, the relative permittiv-ity of the plasma becomes larger. So, the electromagnetic wavelength propagating in the plasma becomes shorter, resulting in an enhanced standing wave effect and a poorer voltage uniformity. By adopting a curved electrode, the voltage uniformity within the chamber is signifi-cantly improved to ±20% and ±36% under VHF1 and VHF2, respectively  (Fig. 5b,e). In the PECVD system, an additional glass plate is required on the curved electrode to maintain the vacuum in the curved part of  the electrode. The calculated results indicate that voltage uniformity can be significantly improved to ±4.6% and ±10% under VHF1 and VHF2,  ηραηρ ηρηρ ρρρρρρρρρηρρρηραηρ ρρρρρρρρρηρρρ ρηρηρηαρρρ 	ρρρ  ρηρηρηαρρρρρρ  	ηη  	 ­	­  	 ­­­­	ηραηρηρηρηραηρ		 Fig. 6 | Dark degradation of SHJ solar cells and mechanism. a,b, Dark degradation of SHJ solar cells with nc-SiOx:H(n) deposited under VHF1 (a) and VHF2 (b), over 130 days and with light soaking (LS); the curves are normal distributions from 16 devices and the horizontal dashed lines represent average  PCE values of as-fabricated devices (25.71% and 25.84% for VHF1 and VHF2, respectively). c,d, Elemental depth profiles of a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO stacks with nc-SiOx:H(n) deposited under VHF1 (c) and VHF2 (d) on a silicon substrate measured by TOF-SIMS. Nature Energy | Voume 8 | December 2023 | 13751385 1381 respectively (Fig. 5c,f). However, the plasma cannot be completely prevented from entering the curved part of the electrode during the deposition process, due to the need for gas input and exhaust. Thus,  the uniformity improvement may be in between the ranges of curved electrodes with or without the glass plate for VHF1 (4.6–20%) and VHF2 (10–36%), which is consistent with the experimental results shown in Fig. 4a,b. Furthermore, other factors such as dust formation, gas deple-tion and the inhomogeneous42, complex structure and deformation of substrate and electrode43,44 may also influence the homogeneity of silicon thin films.Dark degradation of SHJ solar cells at VHF1  and VHF2In addition to the large-area uniformity, we also observed a lower dark degradation rate of SHJ devices under VHF1 than under VHF2, as shown in Fig. 6a,b. Both SHJ cells exhibit a similar dark degradation in the first 40days, and then the dark degradation accelerates for the devices under VHF2. In 130days, the devices under VHF1 show an absolute average degradation rate of 0.0025% per day, representing only one third of that under VHF2 (0.0074% per day). The dark degradation mainly is manifested in FF and Voc decreases (Supplementary Fig. 7), while Jsc exhibits a negligible degradation; as a result, the degradation is likely due to a loss in surface passivation. After light soaking under 80suns at 230°C for 40s, the device PCE can almost be fully recov-ered under VHF1 (average PCE (ηave)–0.04%), whereas a relatively larger PCE loss (ηave–0.15%) is observed under VHF2, as also shown in  Fig. 6. With regards to the light-soaking-induced improvement, this can most likely be attributed to an anomalous Staebler–Wronski effect, known to yield improved carrier selectivity of SHJ contact stacks45. As a possible explanation behind the dark degradation, elemental depth profiles (carbon, C; hydrogen, H; and oxygen, O2) in the c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO stack were measured before and after dark degrada-tion using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), as shown in Fig. 6c,d. Compared with the degraded device under VHF1, a decrease of H and an increase of O2 near the a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n) interface and in the a-Si:H(i) passivation layer are observed on the degraded device under VHF2, while C exhibits negligible change. This is likely attributed to the promotion of SiH4 dissociation induced by a high electron density under the increasing excitation frequency of the PECVD, intrinsically, resulting in a lower density of the nc-SiOx:H(n) due to the high amount of SiH2 and SiH3 in the film19,46,47. Hence, the porous nc-SiOx:H(n) film, containing voids and defect states, is more likely to suffer from the effusion of hydrogen and the intrusion of oxygen and moisture, which may lead to the oxidation and passivation deg-radation of a-Si:H(i), resulting in PCE degradation (especially in Voc  and FF), according to Liu et al.’s work48,49. This is consistent with the fact that the degradation of a device under VHF2 stems from the Voc and FF reduction (Supplementary Fig. 7). We also found that after light soaking, the device PCE loss under VHF2 is mainly ascribed to the Voc and FF decrease, probably due to the passivation degradation and series resistance increase induced by the oxidation of the a-Si:H(i). Further systematic studies are needed to determine the effect of the PECVD excitation frequency on the microstructure of nc-SiOx:H(n) films  and the final device stability. Furthermore, our findings are directly transferrable to perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells relying on SHJ bottom-cell technologies, aiding in their race to the market.SHJ solar cells with Cu-plated electrodesAccording to optical loss analysis using EQE and reflection (Supplemen-tary Fig. 8), front silver finger shading loss (1.30mAcm–2) is identified as one of the main PCE loss factors due to a large Ag finger width of 43.3µm (Supplementary Fig. 9). To further improve the device per-formance, an advanced Cu plating technology by SunDrive was used to replace the screen-printed Ag electrode. SunDrive incorporates a direct plating technique in which copper is directly electroplated onto the TCO film, avoiding the complications and complexity associated with an additional seed layer deposition (for example, physical vapor deposited (PVD) Cu (ref. 50) or screen-printed Ag (ref. 51)) and the etch-back process required for other well-adopted plating techniques. This allows for the finger contact widths to be defined solely by the width of the openings in the masking film. The Jsc and FF significantly improved to 40.80mAcm–2 and 86.28%, respectively, resulting in a cer-tified PCE of 26.41% for full-area bifacial c-Si solar cells with Cu-plated electrodes (Fig. 7a and Table 1), which agrees well with the enhancement of the EQE (Fig. 1d). The Jsc improvement (0.36mAcm–2) can be mainly attributed to the reduced shading loss, thanks to a much narrower Cu finger width (9µm), as demonstrated by the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image in Fig. 7b and the optical microscope images (Supplementary Fig. 10). We can observe that the dense, uniform and smooth Cu-plated finger forms a continuous contact with IMO, while the low-temperature Ag paste contact is filled with nanometre-size voids (Supplementary Fig. 9), and some organic residues remain in the fingers along with undesirable point contacts with TCO under-neath (ref. 29). As a result, the bulk resistivity of the Cu finger and contact resistivity of the IMO/Cu interface are much lower than that of a screen-printed Ag electrode (Supplementary Table 2), resulting    	 	  �����	�� ���� ­­��� €‚ƒ„…„‚††‡ˆ	‰Š	‰ƒ��‡ˆ�	ƒ�ƒŠ�„�„	„ ‹„‰Š�„�„	„ ˆŒ Fig. 7 | SHJ solar cell with Cu-plated electrode. a, Certified I–V curve of the SHJ device with Cu-plated electrode under standard test conditions.

Nature Energy | Voume 8 | December 2023 | 137513851382 in a higher FF. A damp heat (DH) stability test was conducted for the module with Cu-plated cells, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 11. We observe that the Cu-plated module shows a comparable degradation (<4%) to the Ag screen-printed module after the test with a DH85 meter (1,000h). These merits demonstrate the great potential of Cu-plated electrodes for efficiency improvements in SHJ solar cells.ConclusionsWe designed and developed a production-scale PECVD system featuring a high excitation frequency (VHF1) for nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer depo-sition, enabling improvements in both optoelectronic properties and large-area uniformity. With the industrially compatible nc-SiOx:H(n) window layer, the front electron selective a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO stack displays a low parasitic absorption, a high-quality surface passiva-tion and a low contact resistivity, resulting in a certified PCE of 25.98% on M6-size bifacial SHJ solar cells with conventional screen-printed silver electrodes. The SHJ device under VHF1 exhibits a lower dark degrada-tion rate and a narrower PCE distribution range, compared to that under VHF2. With advanced Cu plating technology, high-quality Cu electrodes featuring a narrow width, low bulk resistivity and low contact resistivity are obtained. By replacing the screen-printed silver electrode with the Cu-plated electrode, the certified PCE is further boosted to 26.41% on an M6-size SHJ device, representing the best efficiency for full-area bifacial c-Si solar cells with Cu metallization. This work provides effec-tive strategies for high-throughput SHJ solar cell fabrication, which can accelerate the mass production of SHJ solar cells.MethodsDevice fabricationCommercial M6-size (274.5cm2) n-type (100)-oriented Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers (150µm, 1cm) were used in this work. A wet-chemical process including saw-damage removal, texturing and cleaning was applied to the as-cut wafers. An intrinsic a-Si:H passivation layer (5nm) was first deposited by PECVD on both sides of the wafer, and then nc-SiOx:H(n) layers with different thicknesses were deposited as the front window layer under RF, VHF1 and VHF2 without surface pretreat-ment, followed by 30nm hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide with p-type doping (nc-Si:H(p)) deposition at the rear side. All the a-Si:H(i), nc-SiOx:H(n) and nc-Si:H(p) layers were deposited using the large-size PECVD system designed and produced by Suzhou Maxwell Technologies. Detailed deposition parameters are listed in Supple-mentary Table 1. After PECVD deposition, a newly developed IMO (80nm) was sputtered on both sides; the abbreviation M stands for transition metals including titanium, cerium and tantalum. There are titanium oxide (TiO2), cerium oxide (CeO2) and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) with corresponding mass ratios of 0.22wt%, 0.14wt% and 0.03wt%, respectively, in the target. The PVD deposition parameters and opto-electronic properties of IMO can be found in our previous work35,52. For metallization, silver electrodes were prepared by screen printing  using a low-temperature silver paste, followed by annealing at 210°C  for 20min.Copper-plated electrodesAlternatively, for the champion cell, a copper-based electrode was applied using proprietary processes at SunDrive. The wafers were first coated in a resin-based mask, deposited at room temperature using a deposition system built by SunDrive. Once coated, wafers were placed onto a heated bed at a temperature of 100°C for a period of 6min to  allow for solvent evaporation and mask stabilization. The final thick-ness of the mask was determined to be 8±1µm. Once coated, the mask was selectively exposed to a collimated light source through a shadow mask consisting of the desired grid pattern, for a duration of  5s and with an illumination wavelength between 350nm and 450nm using a home-built optical system (SunDrive). The mask was then selectively opened via a short 20s submersion in an alkaline-based solution held at a temperature of 30–40°C. The average width of the finger openings in the mask was approximately 10µm. The TCO surface, exposed through the openings, was then subjected to bias-assisted light-induced plating of copper in a horizontal plating tool using a pro-prietary acid-based copper electroplating formulation and a phospho-rus deoxidized copper sacrificial anode, which was positioned 5mm from the wafer surface. During plating, the cell’s surface was exposed to a light source with a colour temperature of 6,500K, and an intensity tuned to enable a plating current of 42mAcm–2. The plating duration was set to 10min, resulting in an average deposited contact height of 13±1µm. The copper-plated cells were rinsed in deionized water for a duration of 2min followed by a brief dry under a fan-forced infrared dryer. Once dry, a similar plating system was then used to plate a thin coating (<100nm) of silver on the surface of the Cu to minimize the risk of Cu oxidation. The silver plating was performed in a nitrate-based electrolyte with an inert anode for a duration of 5s. Cells were then submerged in a deionized rinse bath for a duration of 2min prior to drying. Surface masks on the cell were then removed by submersion in an alkaline-based solution at room temperature for a duration of 2min, followed by a 5min rinse in deionized water and subsequent drying.Light soaking and MgF2 anti-reflection layerA light soaking process was then performed under high-intensity light-emitting diode treatment for all SHJ solar cells with screen-printed Ag electrodes and Cu-plated electrodes. This light soaking process before and after dark degradation in Fig. 6 are under the same condi-tions of 80suns at 230°C for 40s. For cells sent to the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) for certification, a 110-nm-thick MgF2 film was deposited on the surface of the wafer using a thermal evaporator (VNano), with the deposited area defined by a shadow mask to ensure that the cell busbars remain uncoated.CharacterizationRaman spectra were obtained at room temperature in a backscattering geometry with an excitation wavelength of 325nm (Renishaw). The optical transmission, absorption and reflection spectra were measured on a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda1050). The minority carrier lifetimes of the passivated samples were measured by a Sinton flash tester (WCT-120) under transient mode. The contact resistivity of the c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO was measured using the Cox and Strack method, using the structure shown as an inset in Fig. 3b, where the front IMO/Al electrode with different diameters was deposited through a shadow mask. The dark current–voltage measurements were performed on a probe station (Supplementary Fig. 3), and the c was extracted by fitting the trend of resistance versus circular contact diameter. The contact resistivity of the metal electrodes/IMO was meas-ured using photovoltaic tools (TLM SCAN). The cross-section of the c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO interface was observed by HR-TEM (FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300). Elemental profiles of the c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-SiOx:H(n)/IMO interface before and after dark degradation were analysed by TOF-SIMS (ION TOF, GmbH-Muenster), using a 500eV Cs+ sputter beam. For large-scale uniformity characterization, nc-SiOx:H(n) films and SHJ devices were fabricated on 20 pieces of M6 wafers placed at various locations in the chamber. Illuminated current density (J)–V characteristics of SHJ solar cells were measured under standard con-ditions (25°C, 100mWcm2) using a solar simulator, which was cali-brated using a certified reference cell from Fraunhofer ISE. The EQE and reflectance spectra of SHJ devices were measured from 300 to 1,180nm using the Bentham PVE300-IVT system. For the simulation, the voltage distribution partial differential equations were solved numerically with the finite elements method using the commercial solver FLEXPDE.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Port-folio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Copper metallization together with multi-busbar cell interconnection is considered as effective way to low shading loss and electrode ohmic loss. While, the electrode adhesion and parasitic plating are the key process challenges limiting the copper metalli - zation of SHJ solar cells. In this research, the copper plated SHJ solar cells with high electrode aspect ratio and an efficiency of 23.35% have been achieved on M2 wafers. The SEM images show the holes in the plated layers will deteriorate the adhesion between plated copper and seed-layer. The glass/back sheet structure (GBS) modules have been laminated to evaluate the influence of parasitic plating on damp-heat (DH) performance. The degradation in output power (P max ) is up to 4.90%, which is primarily due to a decreased open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF). It can be ascribed to the deteriorated surface recombination and interconnection. Although the parasitic plating on the wafer edge has ignorable influence on damp heat test after etch-back process, it is still necessary to protect the cell edge to avoid parasitic plating. The research evaluates the pro - cess challenges of copper metallization of SHJ solar cells, which offers a refer for achieving high reliability and low levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of photovoltaic power generation.    1.Introduction To achieve CO 2  neutrality, the future of our electricity supply will see a massive increase in solar power generation. The annual photovoltaic (PV) module production rate must dramatically increase from ~135 GW (GW) in 2020 to ~3 TW (TW) around 2030, and requires a total of 20–80 TW photovoltaics until 2050 and 80–170 TW until 2100 [1–3]. Highly conductive silver paste is the dominated electrode material for PV industry, which requires a significant material consumption reduc - tion to meet the multi-TW scale manufacturing target in about ten years from now. High efficiency silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell applies ultra-thin amorphous silicon films as passivation layer and doping layer [4,5]. The bulk resistivity of low-temperature silver pastes (~6    cm) is three times higher than that of the high-temperature counterparts (~2    cm) due to the temperature limitation [6–8]. With a SHJ solar cell demanding ~210 mg usage of silver paste (9 busbars, 24.5%, bifacial, M6 size wafer), the cost of low temperature silver paste is ~3.4 UScents/W at today’s price (~1100 USD/kg), which occupies a domi - nant proportion of the non-silicon cost. Thus, the urgent innovation on screen printing technologies is required for SHJ solar cells to reduce silver consumption. The formation of copper plated contact is assumed to be one of the most promising technologies for low-cost mass production of SHJ solar cells, as it is a good solution to improve the efficiency with high aspect ratio and low contact resistance [9–11]. There have been many inno - vative contributions in seed layer deposition [12–16], selective pattern formation [17–20], simplification of process [21–23], etc. The copper plated SHJ solar cell has just achieved the outstanding efficiency of 26.41% (certificated by ISFH) on M6 size wafer (274.5 cm 2 ) by Sundrive and Maxwell [24]. However, there are still some barriers hindering the application of the copper plating on SHJ solar cell, such as complicated plating process, copper-induced degradation and reliability [25]. On the module level, the damp heat reliability of copper plated SHJ solar module is another issue restricting the commercialization of  *Corresponding author.

Benefitting from the glass/glass (GG) structure module, Silevo’s copper plated modules have only �2.45% output power loss after 2000 h damp heat stress [26]. It also has been proven that the polyolefin encapsulant material has lower water vapor trans - mission rate (WVTR) value, which helps to reduce the degradation in damp heat test [27,28]. The electrode adhesion and parasitic plating are the key process challenges limiting the copper metallization of SHJ solar cells. The organic-based resists (such as, laminated dry film resist and screen- printed photoresist) are considered as the potential pattern solution for the mass production of SHJ metallization. While, the edge of the SHJ solar cell is not covered with resist after development process, making copper easily to be plated on the cross-section of silicon wafer. The complete copper plating metallization process is challenging, such as complicated plating process, long-term copper-induced degradation and reliability. In this work, the copper plated SHJ solar cells with a high electrode aspect ratio and an efficiency of 23.35% have been achieved. The glass/POE/back sheet structure modules have been encapsulated to evaluate the potential influence of parasitic plating after etch-back. The damp heat performance of SHJ modules were evaluated up to 1000 h under 85  ◦ C, 85% relative humidity (RH). The photoelectric perfor - mance of SHJ solar cells and the damp heat performance of modules were analyzed. The results show great potential to achieve highly reli - able and efficiently SHJ solar cells after careful optimization. 2.Experimental details 2.1.Preparation of SHJ solar cells The M2 size, n-type c-Si (100) wafers with resistivity of 1–3  cm were used as the substrates. The wet-chemical process was applied to remove saw damage and create a random pyramid surface texture. Both intrinsic and doped a-Si:H layers on the front and rear side were deposited for the emitter and back surface field by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), respectively. Then, tin doped in - dium oxide films (ITO), with the thickness of 80 nm on the front side and 75 nm on the rear side (both on textured wafer), were deposited by using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) system. After ITO deposition, the samples were sorted into two groups. Group A was used for copper plating and the subtracts were annealed at 200  ◦ C for 20 min in air. Each side was connected to DC power source by electrical deposition contact pads. Copper was plated under the conditions of ~8 ASD, 6 min with phosphorous-copper anode (0.02%–0.1% phosphorous content) on 200 nm copper seed-layer on ITO film. The light sensitive dry film was used as the plating resist. The detailed process could be found in our previous papers [20,29]. Group B was metalized by screen printing silver grids on both sides and annealed at 200  ◦ C for 20 min in air. 2.2 Module encapsulation and damp heat stress set-up. The monofacial glass/back sheet (GBS) single cell modules (three single cell modules and one 2 ×2 cells module) with copper plated were laminated for damp heat test. The Polyolefin elastomer (POE) was used as encapsulant materials. Detailed lamination parameters can be found in support information Table S1. We applied high-temperature and humidity acceleration tests (85  ◦ C temperature and 85% humidity for 1000 h) according to standard IEC 61215 procedure. We removed the module from the damp heat chamber and measure the electrical prop - erties at 100, 200, 300, 500, 700, 1000 h, respectively. 2.2.Measurement systems The geometries were measured by Olympus optical microscope with a CCD camera and 3D measuring laser microscope (Olympus OLS-4100). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra measurement was performed within the 300–1100 nm wavelength range using a xenon (Xe) lamp. The cross-section and the element distribution were measured by Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). SHJ solar cells were characterized by using current- voltage (I–V) measurements and Suns-V oc  system. After each time in - terval during the damp heat experiment, the electrical performances of SHJ modules and electroluminescence (EL) measurement were all measured by Wavelabs PV system. The solar simulator is provided from Wavelabs SINUS 220, with spectrum, homogeneity and stability matching class AAA according to IEC 60904 standard. All the I–V measurement is under standard test conditions (AM 1.5 G, 25  ◦ C, 1000 W/m 2 ). 3.Result and discussion 3.1.Photoelectric performance and power loss analysis of copper plating schemes Fig. 1 presents the surface morphologies of electrodes with screen- printing (a), (c) and copper-plating (b), (d) process, respectively. The screen-printed finger width is around 44   m and the morphology of silver finger is unsmooth. It can be seen there are also some silver par - ticles near the silver finger on the ITO film, which could be ascribed to the extrusion of the squeegee or the residual silver paste on the screen, making a little bit silver paste is printed on the non-designed electrode area during the screen-printing process. Benefitting from the smoother morphology of resist after development, the finger width of copper finger is around 21   m and the shape of copper plated finger is clear, whose morphology is significantly improved compared to silver finger. According to the electrode thickness results by 3D laser microscope, the cross section of copper plated finger is rectangular, with the height of around 12   m and surface roughness less than 2   m. While, the max electrode height of screen-printed finger is around 24   m, that is a ~9   m height gap between highest position and lowest position. Thus, the plated copper finger is much smoother than screen-printed silver finger and its aspect ratio (~0.6, 12   m/21   m) is higher than screen-printed finger (~0.34, 15   m/44   m). Considering the remarkably narrower finger width, the shading loss of SHJ solar cell with copper metallization is significantly limited, which has the potential to boost short-circuit current. The electrical performance of screen-printed cell and copper plated cell with same SHJ substrates is presented in Fig. 2. Both are bifacial solar cells and the electrical properties are measured on copper chuck. Benefits from the excellent passivation, an impressive V oc  of 739.9 mV and Eff of 23.45% has been obtained for screen-printed cell. According to the finger morphologies in Fig. 1, the copper plated electrode has been obtained with obviously reduced finger width and shading loss (~5% decrease of shading compared to screen-printed cell), resulting in a significant improvement of I sc  (0.38 A, 1.56 mA/cm 2  J sc  gain). It should be noted that the V oc  is 6 mV lower than screen-printed cell, we can ascribe to the edge recombination due to manual operation (will be discussed in EL measurement). The reduction of the electrode shading area leads to the remarkably decreased contact area and increased contact resistance between the electrode and ITO film, which results in a decrease in FF. Even so, we still achieve an efficiency of 23.35% for copper plated cell and can be further improved by carefully operation and optimization of electrode design. The photos of copper plated SHJ solar cell and encapsulated module are shown in Fig. S1 in Support document. A recent average cell efficiency of >23.7% has been obtained shown in Fig. S2. The calculated photogenerated current density from EQE spectrum of either screen-printed sample or copper plated sample is ~40.0 mA/cm 2  at the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm (shown in Fig. S3). The photogenerated current density difference calculated from EQE is only 0.3%, while the J sc  difference tested in Fig. 2 is 1.56 mA/cm 2  (~4%). Therefore, the current gain of copper plated SHJ solar cell is mainly boosted from remarkably reduced shading loss. The transparent conductive oxide (TCO) has been identified as a kind of chemically- stable materials [30,31]. The ITO films will not be etched under the protection of plating resist. Compare with screen-printed SHJ solar cell,  J. Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        there is no evidence of photocurrent degradation when the samples were immersed in the plating solution. The main factor affecting the short-circuit current is the shading loss caused by the width of elec - trodes, which is consistent with the analysis in Fig. 1. The ultimate purpose of solar module technology is to achieve highest possible power out for a given solar cell efficiency class. Generated current is collected by fingers to busbars, then flows to sol - dered ribbon. The front side metallization of solar cell affects the power loss obviously and should balance the optical and electrical loss. For copper plated SHJ solar cell, the electrode-related power loss has a significant decrease due to the bulk resistivity of finger reduces to 2    cm. Thus, benefited from extremely low resistivity of copper finger, finer finger width (20   m or below) and bigger finger pitch can be applied to reduce shading loss without increasing girds power loss. On the other hand, denser finger design is possible to control the electrical loss and increase fill factor without sacrificing J sc , which helps reduce cell to module loss. The photo-generated current transports out of the solar cell to another one by the ribbons. Recent trend of solar cell is utilizing more busbars (9 BB for M6 cell, 12 BB for M12 cell), which is driven mainly by cell efficiency and silver consumption. Its cell efficiency is higher than that of SHJ solar cell with five busbars. The transport distance of carrier is an important factor affecting electrode-related power loss. Shorter transport distance of electrons means Ohmic power loss per finger drops and more power can be extracted from each individual solar cell. The evolution to multi busbars encapsulation is driven by the similar idea. The multi-busbars technology applies copper wires with low- temperature alloy coating layer and finger interconnected in a vertical direction to transport current. The power loss analysis of different metallization schemes is shown in Fig. 3 (a). The colored scale on the right of Fig. 3 (a) is the Power loss (P loss ). When solar module encap - sulated with 18 wires of 0.2 mm in diameter, the finger length can be decreased from 15.6 mm (5 BB cell) to ~4 mm, making the finger’s ohmic power loss negligible. Meanwhile, it can be easily calculated that a reduced busbar optical shading (2.3% compared to 3.2%) compared to 5 busbars. Based on the above analysis, the power losses of different metalli - zation schemes with optimized parameters are illustrated in Fig. 3 (b). The power loss of screen-printed scheme is higher than 8% due to its higher resistivity of low-temperature silver paste and increased shading loss. That is the advantages of copper metallization compared to screen- printed grids. The total power loss of multi busbars interconnection is ~6.5%, which could be ascribed to negligible electrodes ohmic loss by shorten finger length and reduced busbar optical shading. Take advan - tage of both copper metallization and multi busbars interconnection, the total power loss can reach as low as 5.36%. It should be noted that the power loss of emitter (P emitter ) for plating þMBB is a little bit higher than for SP þMB. The P emitter  has a negative correlation with contact area  Fig. 1.SHJ solar cells (a) (c) with screen printed finger, (b) (d) with electroplated finger.

Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        between electrode and TCO, the wider finger with the lower P emitter . Thanks to the higher bulk resistivity, lower contact resistivity and finer finger width, copper plating has great potential to achieve high- efficiency and low-cost metallization and interconnection solution for SHJ solar cells. 3.2.Influence of copper plating process on SHJ solar cells To obtain better adhesion between plated electrode and TCO, a 200 nm copper seed layer is deposited on TCO surface, following by subse - quent copper and tin plating process. Therefore, both seed layer and TCO interface, plated electrode and copper seed layer interface signifi - cantly influence the adhesion. To detailed investigate the interface be - tween copper and SHJ solar cell, SEM with EDS appendix are used to measure the cross-sectional morphology and the distribution of Cu and Si elements (shown in Fig. 4). It can be seen from the figure that the electroplated copper is very dense, and the copper is covered on the surface of SHJ solar cell uniformly. Several micro-voids can be found, which could be ascribed to the high deposition rate, the bubbles released during the plating process do not have enough time to break away from the surface. We further measure the plated SHJ solar cell with poor peel force in Fig. 4 (f), many voids can be found and the electrode peeled at the interface are observed, resulting in deteriorated adhesion. It should be noted the voids could be also found at both seed layer and TCO interface, which is considered that the copper seed layer is partly corroded in the copper sulfate solution with very low PH (hydrogen ion concentration). The peel force of copper plated electrodes is presented in Fig. 5. It is clear that the copper electrodes with gradient low-to-high plating current density process (Fig. 5 (a)) display better adhesion, compared to that of electrodes with high current density plating process (Fig. 5 (b)). That means the plating current density should not be too high in the early stage of copper plating process, otherwise it will easily introduce the voids at the interface and deteriorate the adhesion. PECVD are applied to deposit amorphous silicon thin films as elec - tron contact or hole contact for SHJ solar cells. During the deposition process, the plasma fills the vacuum chamber, it is possible to deposit amorphous silicon films on the edge side and cross-section of wafer (shown in Fig. S4). Therefore, these areas not covered by resist provide the pathways for current, results in parasitic plating during the elec - troplating process. The influence of parasitic plating at the edge side is shown in Fig. 6. It is clear to observe that copper and tin are deposited on the edge side and cross-section of SHJ solar cell if there is no edge protection. We also provide the detailed images of parasitic plating before and after etch-back process. The 200 nm Cu seed layer is deposited full area on the ITO surface. Therefore, the seed layer must be etched after plating process. Usually, a mixed solution of oxidizer and acid to etch Cu seed layer to form selective copper finger as the last plating process. Since the adhesion of copper plated on silicon is very poor, making it easy to be peeled off during this etch-back process. It should be noted that the ITO film is not deposited to cover full area of wafer to avoid edge shunt. The main reason the cross-section area seems a little bit different in Fig. 6 (a) and Fig. 6 (b) is the possible substrate movement during ITO deposition. It is also proved in Fig. S5 that the parasitic plating thickness is different from cell to cell (from ~2   m to  Fig. 3.The power loss analysis of multi-busbar design and different metallization schemes. (a) the influence of bus bars number and bus bar width on power loss, the color bar presents the power loss. (b) the power loss of different metallization scheme.

Fig. 4.The cross-section and EDS images between copper and SHJ solar cell interface.   J. Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        10   m, and possible to 15   m in Fig. 6). The edge side and cross-section of SHJ solar cell is clear and without any plated metal when the edge is protected by the resist (shown in Fig. 6 (b)). However, the protection process requires additional resist to cover the edge, which will increase the complexity of the copper metallization and the cost. It is known to all that copper acts as a deep level impurity, this causes the risk that copper diffuses into the wafer and deteriorates the device performance. Usually, very small amount of metal is plated on the edge side, which will be etched during the subsequent etch-back process. Fig. 7 presents the SEM image and EDS elemental analysis of parasitic plated copper after etch-back process. It is clearly shown in Fig. 7 (d) that there is still copper element detected on the wafer surface. The presence of the oxygen element signal is due to the use of oxidant during etch-back process. It can be found the Cu signal is rather low in EDS. Considering the EDS test area is far from the copper electrode, the copper covered the test location before etch-back process and the dis - tribution of the N element signal (not shown here), we speculate that there are still little amounts of copper on the surface after corrosion. Thus, the influence of parasitic plating for SHJ solar cell should be evaluated carefully to avoid long term reliability degradation. Further investigation is ongoing. In this work, we try to evaluate its influence on cell level and module level. Fig. 8 presents the influence of copper plating process on photo voltage of SHJ solar cells under different irradiation density by Suns-V oc  measurement. We found that the parasitic plating at the cell edge mainly affect photo voltage under low light irradiation. The photo voltage is nearly not affected when the light irradiation exceeds 0.3 Suns. The low level of carrier recombination in SHJ solar cells, making them highly sensitive to any additional defects. It seems the plating process has a negative effect on passivation, resulting in the worse response at low irradiation. Detailed parameters can be found in Table S2. The ideality factor at 0.1 Suns increases significantly from 1.22 to 2.16 after coppering plating and subsequent annealing process. The ideality factor reflects the quality of the PN junction. We have measured many SHJ samples, both copper plated cells and screen-printed cells. Statistically, the plating process has negative effect to SHJ solar cells, which proven by Suns-V oc  measurement. Meanwhile, we have also analyzed the effect of copper on SHJ substrates (shown in Fig. S6). The results find that the  Fig. 5.The peel force of copper plated electrodes, (a) gradient low-to-high plating current density process (the plating recipe starts from 3 ASD to 6 ASD, and increase to 8 ASD), (b) high current density plating process (the plating recipe starts from 8 ASD directly).

Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        minority carrier lifetime  · , implied V oc  and implied FF are almost un - changed, which proves ITO is an effective copper diffusion barrier. Therefore, we speculate that the degradation detected from Suns-V oc  could be ascribed from the parasitic plating at the edge area, where has been proved the existence of copper even after etch-back. More detailed work needs to be carried out to validate our inferences in the future. To further evaluate the influence of parasitic plating on reliability, the single-cell modules with glass/POE/back sheet structure are encapsulated. The normalized changes in the electrical performance of the test modules at 85  ◦ C and 85% RH with increasing ageing time, are depicted in Fig. 9. A similar evolution trend of V oc , I sc  and FF could be found, with ~1.5% degradation after 1000 h damp heat stress, resulting in a relatively obvious power loss finally. A maximum output power (P max ) changes of �4.90% is obtained for copper plated SHJ module. The drop in FF goes along with a gradually increasing series resistance, which could be ascribed to deteriorated interconnection between copper plated fingers and copper wire. In the further work, denser finger design could be applied to control the electrical loss and increase fill factor, which help reduce cell to module loss. To further analyze the electrical homogeneity and entireness of the copper plated SHJ solar module, EL measurements were performed in Fig. 10. For EL measurement, the module is operated as a light-emitting diode, meaning that current is applied in reverse direction. The emitted radiation due to recombination effects can be detected with a sensitive NIR Si-CCD-camera. As the increasing damp heat stress time, the light intensity of EL images at the edges around copper plated SHJ solar cell starts to reduce, while there is nearly no visible change in the center. This performance change is in good agreement with the degradation of module output power loss. The luminous intensity is stronger near the busbar area, which means the more effective collection of carriers.

The entry of water vapor leads to passivation and interconnection defect as expected. The front encapsulant is hydrolyzed, which deteriorates the connection between copper wire bus bars and plated copper fingers, firstly at the perimeter of the cell, then advancing toward the center with continued DH exposure. That’s result is consistent with the previous work by Wenzhu Liu [32]. The detailed influence of different encapsulants on SHJ solar cells is carrying out and will be released later. 4.Conclusion The copper metallization technology for SHJ solar cells needs to break through the complicated process limits before mass production application. This work focuses on some process challenges during cop - per metallization process on solar cell level and module level. The copper plated SHJ solar cell has a high electrode aspect ratio and an efficiency of 23.35% on M2 size wafer. The SEM images show the holes in the plated layers will deteriorate the adhesion between plated copper and seed-layer. The GBS structure modules have been laminated to evaluate the influence of parasitic plating on DH performance. The degradation of GBS module in output power (P max ) is up to 4.90% after 1000 h damp-heat stress, which is primarily due to a decreased open- circuit voltage and fill factor. The parasitic plated metal on the wafer edge side will be etched in the etch-back process and seems have ignorable electrical properties influence on module level, it is still sug - gested to protect the cell edge to avoid parasitic plating. After further optimization of SHJ solar cell process, encapsulant material and glass/ glass structure, the copper plated SHJ solar modules show great po - tential for high reliability and low levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of photovoltaic power generation.

A primary concern is the direct contact between front-sided metal electrodes and boron emitters, resulting in substantial carrier recombination losses and limiting further efficiency im - provements. Here, we introduce a low-temperature approach to deposit a local boron-doped amorphous silicon [a-Si:H(p)] between front-sided metal electrodes and boron emitters. This method, avoiding issues associated with high-temperature processes, demonstrates excellent passivation and contact properties, featuring the lowest contact resistivity (<1 mcm 2 ) and a low saturation current density (<400 fA/cm 2 ). The outstanding passivation and contact properties remain robust even with variations in diborane flow rates during a-Si:H(p) fabrication, annealing temperatures, and sheet resistances of boron emitters. We elucidate the factors contrib - uting to the enhanced passivation observed in boron emitters with a-Si:H(p) through a combination of simula - tions and experiments. The a-Si:H(p) layer between boron emitters and metal electrodes acts as a protective barrier, preventing the diffusion of metal atoms and suppressing carrier recombination. A heterojunction is formed between a-Si:H(p) and the boron emitter, facilitating electric-field passivation. Consequently, the TOP - Con SCs incorporating a-Si:H(p) achieve an efficiency of 24.50%, surpassing their counterparts without a-Si:H(p) (23.11%). This work utilizes low-temperature technology to achieve fully passivated contact, providing insights for the development of high-efficiency TOPCon SCs.    1.Introduction Tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells (SCs) have emerged as the mainstream photovoltaic (PV) technology, owing to their notable advantages of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and cost-effectiveness in mass production [1–3]. Continuous advancements in efficiency and cost reduction are crucial for promoting the competi - tiveness of TOPCon SCs in the PV industry. Rigorous numerical simulations indicate that TOPCon SCs, with optimal passivation and contact properties, can achieve a theoretical efficiency of 28.7%, making them the most promising technology to approach the efficiency limit of crystalline silicon (c-Si) SCs (29.4%) [4,5]. However, further improving the efficiency of TOPCon SCs remains challenges due to inherent limi - tations in surface passivation and contact resistance. In a typical high-efficiency TOPCon SCs, over 60% of the recombination loss occur on the front side, whereas less than 25% recombination loss is attributed  *Corresponding author at: Zhejiang Provincial Engineering Research Center of Energy Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Ningbo 315201, China **Corresponding authors.

Despite improvements in silicon wafer quality, reduction in the thickness of c-Si wafers, and optimization efforts on the rear-sided TOPCon, resulting in low front- and rear-sided saturation current densities (i.e., J 0,pass  and J 0_rear ) of less than 1 and 5 fA/cm 2 , respectively [7–9], substantial improvements in efficiency are still challenging. The primary challenge lies in addressing significant recombination losses in the boron emitter, where the low boron concentration in the boron emitter/metal contact region hinders further reduction in recombination losses at the metal/silicon interface. For instance, if the saturation current densities of the front metal/ - emitter interface (J 0,met ) and the uncontacted interface (i.e., J 0,pass ) are 600–800 and 8–12 fA/cm 2 , respectively, even with only a 1.5%–2.0% metallization fraction, it results in the saturation current densities of the front metal/emitter (J 0,e ) reaching 17–28 fA/cm 2  [10]. This limitation severely impedes improvements in the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and efficiency, especially on the boron emitters with high sheet resistivity (R sheet ) that are currently widely used. Another substantial challenge is the high contact resistivity of boron-doped emitters, possibly due to excessive Schottky barriers caused by Fermi energy level pinning effect [11,12], especially when the surface boron concentration is lower than 10 19  cm –3  with a sheet resistance of >150 /sq, which will result in high contact resistance and thus severely limit the fill factor (FF) of TOPCon SCs. Therefore, the carrier recombination loss at the front-sided metal/boron emitter interface, controlled by passivation quality and contact resistivity, presents the most significant bottleneck to efficiency improvement of TOPCon SCs [13–16]. To address these limitations, the technology of laser doping selective emitters has been widely explored [17,18]. This approach aims to improve the contact performance of the contact region by employing lasers to increase the doping concentration of the boron emitter below metal fingers. However, this method cannot avoid direct contact of metal electrodes with boron emitters, and consequently, it fails to essentially inhibit carrier recombination loss of the electrode interface [19,20]. As a promising alternative technology, poly-finger presents an opportunity to achieve fully passivating contact by forming a full-area poly-Si layer on boron emitters and selectively etching of the poly-Si film in the uncontacted region to form a poly-Si selective contact [8, 21]. Currently, the J 0,met  and contact resistivity of boron emitters with poly-finger can be reduced to less than 20 fA/cm 2  and 2 mcm 2 , respectively [8,22]. However, this technique has limitations as it in - volves laser pre-opening and high-temperature annealing (over 800 δ C) to form poly-Si, making it more challenging to selectively etch poly-Si film in the uncontacted region [23,24]. Additionally, the crystalliza - tion process of poly-Si during high-temperature treatment may alter the boron and phosphorus diffusion profiles of the front-sided emitters and rear-sided TOPCon structure, respectively. Therefore, the development of a low-temperature process for achieving full passivation contact is critical for further promoting the efficiency of TOPCon SCs. In this work, we develop a low-temperature process (<200 δ C) for creating selective boron emitters through the local deposition of boron- doped amorphous silicon [a-Si:H(p)]. This approach avoids direct con - tact between the metal electrodes and the boron emitter, resulting in improved passivation and contact properties. By optimizing the a-Si:H (p) fabrication process and annealing conditions, the lowest contact resistivity (<1 mcm 2 ) between the metal electrodes and the boron emitters, together with a low J 0,met  (<400 fA/cm 2 ), can be achieved. The superior passivation and contact properties can be well-maintained even under various diborane flow rates for a-Si:H(p) fabrication, annealing temperatures, and sheet resistances of boron emitters. We elucidate the factors contributing to the enhanced passivation perfor - mance observed in boron emitters with a-Si:H(p) through a combination of simulations and experiments. The a-Si:H(p) layer between boron emitters and metal electrodes acts as a protective barrier, preventing the diffusion of metal atoms and suppressing carrier recombination. The presence of a-Si:H(p) can form a heterojunction when combined with a boron emitter, thereby promoting electric-field passivation. Conse - quently, the TOPCon SCs incorporating a-Si:H(p) achieve a PCE of 24.50%, outperforming their counterparts without a-Si:H(p) (23.11%). 2.Experimental details The substrates used for characterization were n-type CZ wafers with a <100>orientation, a thickness of 165   m, and a resistivity of 1–3 cm. The front- and rear- sided silicon wafers were textured by KOH etching. Following RCA cleaning and diluted HF immersion, a high- temperature BBr 3  diffusion process was employed to form double- sided boron-doped emitters with a R sheet  of 108–240 /sq. The a-Si:H (p) films were deposited using a PECVD system operating at a frequency of 13.56 MHz, a deposition temperature of 150 δ C, and employing SiH 4 , H 2 , and diborane (B 2 H 6 ) as precursors. The boron diffusion profiles were adjusted by controlling the B 2 H 6  flow rate. Subsequently, a 10 nm-thick silver layer was thermally evaporated on the a-Si:H(p) films for J 0,met  measurements [25,26]. The manufacturing process for TOPCon SCs is described below. Sil - icon wafers were textured by etching with a KOH alkaline solution. Front-sided boron emitters were formed using the high-temperature BBr 3  diffusion method, and rear-sided boron-doped poly-Si films un - derwent HNO 3 -HF-H 2  acid polishing. Silicon oxide film was fabricated by oxidation in a tube furnace at 100 δ C in an ozone atmosphere, fol - lowed by PECVD deposition of phosphorus-doped a-Si:H using silane, phosphane and H 2  as precursors. High-temperature annealing at 840 δ C was carried out in a quartz tube furnace under a nitrogen atmosphere to achieve a-Si:H crystallization and dopant diffusion. The samples were covered by ALD-deposited AlO x  passivation layers and activated through annealing at 450 δ C. Subsequently, samples were covered with PECVD- deposited SiN x  layers on both sides. The front-sided finger electrode mask with a line width of 6   m was defined using photolithography. The SiN x  and AlO x  films upon the fingers were etched using a buffered oxide etch (BOE) solution, and a-Si:H(p) film was deposited by PECVD. A Ni/ Pd/Ag seed layer was deposited by electron beam evaporation, followed by forming gas anneal (FGA) at 400 δ C for 30 min, and the electrode thickness is increased to 5   m. After that, the rear-sided Cr-Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Microstructure of the a-Si:H(p) film, together with corresponding elemental distributions, was studied using a scanning electron micro - scope (SEM) (Hitachi, S4800) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) (ThermoFisher, Talos F200 X). R sheet  was measured using a four-point probe meter (Polytec, Four Dimensions). Contact resistivity was measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS) combined with the transfer length method (TLM) [27]. The TLM template employs eight rectangular metal elec - trodes with a length (L) of 0.5 cm and a width (W) of 0.1 cm arranged in a linear pattern. The distribution profiles of activated boron atoms at the emitter were measured using an electrochemical capacitive voltage (ECV) system (Buchanan, CVP 21). Passivation parameters were analyzed by a quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC, Sinton WCT-120). The implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ) of the samples after metallization was extracted using photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) (Ai-Shine, Suns-EPL) with a shutter parameter of 1500, where the side covering the metal electrode faces the light source. The electrical per - formance of TOPCon SCs was characterized by the Suns–V oc  analysis system (Sinton WTC-120) under a sun simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5–3A) at 25 δ C and AM 1.5 G (100 mWcm –2 ). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of TOPCon SCs were measured using the EQE system (Enlitech, QE-R3011). 3.Results and discussion 3.1.Fabrication and characterization of boron emitters with a-Si:H(p) The schematic diagrams in Fig. 1A illustrate the fabrication process  H. Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        of TOPCon SCs with a local a-Si:H(p) passivation contact underneath the front-sided metal fingers. A semi-finished TOPCon SCs with the passiv - ation layer and the anti-reflective coating (ARC) layers (i.e., AlOx/SiNx stack) was prepared in advance, and then photoresist was applied to the front side of the samples for accurate patterning. The AlOx/SiNx stack underneath the electrode pattern was selectively etched away, and a 30–40 nm-thick a-Si:H(p) film was deposited at a low temperature of 150 ◦ C using PECVD, followed by the direct deposition of a metal elec - trode using an electron beam system. After removing the photoresist, an FGA process at 400 ◦ C for 30 min was carried out. Finally, the front-sided busbars and rear-sided electrodes were deposited to complete the fabrication of TOPCon SCs. Observing the morphology of the devices under a SEM, as shown in Fig. 1B-1D, the pyramid structure of locally deposited a-Si:H(p) with the metal stack is well-formed. The width of the metal fingers is slightly larger than the photolithography line (6   m), but it uniformly covers the surface of the pyramids. A local view of the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 1C reveals the a-Si:H(p) layer covering the substrate with good contact between the Ni/Pd/Ag electrode and the a-Si:H(p). These SEM images demonstrate the integrity and manufacturability of the TOPCon SCs based on a local a-Si:H(p) underneath the front-sided metal fingers. 3.2.Contact properties of boron emitter with a-Si:H(p) The activated boron concentration significantly influences the con - ductivity of a-Si:H(p) films, which will be investigated in this section. Here, the fixed hydrogen dilution ratio (H 2 :SiH x ) was maintained at 20:3 (in sccm, denoting cubic centimeter per minute at stand temperature and pressure). Subsequently, 40nm-thick a-Si:H(p) films with different diborane flow rates were deposited on symmetrical boron emitters at a low temperature of 150 ◦ C using PECVD, followed by an FGA process at 400 ◦ C for 30min. ECV measurements were employed to determine the profiles of the activated boron concentration, as shown in Fig. 2A and 2B. Fig. 2A exhibits that the activated boron concentration within the emitter and c-Si substrate, as well as the activated boron depth in the c-Si substrate, increase with the diborane flow rate, which is high than that of the counterpart with the boron emitter without a-Si:H(p). Addition - ally, the surface concentration of activated boron for a diborane flow rate of 10 sccm, as shown in Fig. 2B, increases significantly by an order of magnitude compared to the case without a-Si:H(p), effectively addressing the low doping concentration challenge of the laser selective emitter technique [28]. Contact resistivities of these samples are measured using the TLM method (Figures S1 and S2). Samples were prepared by depositing a Ni/ Pd/Ag stack upon the emitter, followed by an FGA process at 400 ◦ C for 30min. Fig. 2C illustrates the variation of contact resistivity with the diborane flow rate. With the flow rate of diborane increases from 3 to 10 sccm, the contact resistivity decreases from 6.3 to 1.0mcm 2 , indi - cating a substantial improvement in contact property compared to the boron emitter without a-Si:H(p) (24.3mcm 2 ). This finding is consis - tent with the ECV results, suggesting that a high diborane flow rate re - sults in a high surface activated boron concentration and improved  Fig. 1.(A) Schematic diagrams describing the fabrication process of TOPCon SCs with a local a-Si:H(p) passivating contact.

H. Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        electrical conductivity [29]. The various metal materials are studied to investigate their effect on electrical properties, as shown in Fig. 2D. The contact resistivities of samples with a-Si:H(p) covered by Ti/Pt/Ag, Ni/Pt/Ag, and Cr/Pt/Ag stacks are determined to be 2.5, 1.5, and 0.5mcm 2 , respectively, much lower than those of samples without a-Si:H(p), i.e., 5.7, 24.3, and 2.8mcm 2  for the three related cases. This implies that the introduction of a-Si:H(p) layers underneath the front-sided metal fingers can significantly improve contact properties, regardless of the metal materials used. Furthermore, the Cr/Pt/Ag stack has lowest contact resistivity, possibly due to the relatively high work-function of Cr [30,31]. The impact of FGA temperature on the contact properties is also investigated, as demonstrated in Fig. 2E. For FGA temperatures lower than 200 δ C, annealing has no noticeable effect on contact resistivity. With the FGA temperature increasing from 200 δ C to 400 δ C, the contact resistivity shows a slight decreasing trend, indicating that a low- temperature FGA process (<500 δ C) leads to a significant improve - ment in contact properties. However, at the FGA temperature of 500 δ C, the contact resistivity significantly increases to over 20mcm 2 . It is speculated that low-temperature annealing (<500 δ C) may form a metal silicide at the interface, reducing contact resistivity, while high- temperature annealing may damage the interface layer between metal fingers and boron emitters, leading to an increase in contact resistivity [30]. To ensure compatibility between the a-Si:H(p) layer and high sheet resistance emitters currently used in the industry, a-Si:H(p) layers were deposited on boron emitters featuring varying sheet resistances. Fig. 2F and S3 show that the contact resistivity can be well-maintained at relatively low values, and no significant variation in the contact re - sistivity values is observed, suggesting that the introduction of the a-Si:H (p) layer can achieve low contact resistivity even for the boron emitters with high sheet resistances. 3.3.Passivation properties and mechanism of boron emitters with a-Si:H (p) In this section, passivation properties of boron emitters with a-Si:H (p) will be investigated. The structure used for passivation measurement is illustrated in Fig. 3A, where a-Si:H(p) films were deposited on both sides of boron emitters. Fig. 3A depicts an increase in recombination current from 40 to 305 fA/cm 2  after the deposition of double-sided a-Si: H(p) on the boron emitters. The passivation quality of samples with a-Si: H(p) significantly decreases compared to the pristine boron emitter without a-Si:H(p). This is a result of the presence of a boron-enriched a- Si:H layer with a high doping concentration and epitaxial growth of the a-Si:H layer occurring at a low PECVD frequency, which together result in high carrier recombination losses [32]. Reduced boron diffusion with high sheet resistance is recognized to reduce Auger recombination, evaluated by J 0,e . However, as the sheet resistance increases, the contact and lateral resistance increase, leading to the decrement in filling factor (FF) of devices [33]. The contact recombination between a-Si:H(p) and metal electrodes is the focus of this study. After metallization, the recombination current density in the metal-contact region is determined to be 360 fA/cm 2 . While there exists a slight rise in recombination current density concerning pre-metallization, it is still nearly 300 fA/cm 2  lower than the samples without a-Si:H(p) (730 fA/cm 2 ). In order to enhance the passivation performance, we monitor the passivation before metallization, and firstly prepared a semi-finished TOPCon device without front- and rear-sided electrodes, which were passivated with an AlO x /SiN x  stack, exhibiting an implied open-circuit voltage of 730mV and a J 0,e  of 10 fA/cm 2 . After metallization, the samples without a-Si:H(p) appear noticeably darker in the vicinity of the metal fingers, as shown by the PL images in Fig. 3C. This suggests that the metal atoms have already diffused into the boron emitters to form recombination centers during metallization, ultimately resulting in a degradation of the passivation performance.

Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        corresponding iV oc  with parameter correction using PL, it can be clearly seen that the iV oc  of the samples with a-Si:H(p) is improved by 11.7mV compared to the counterpart without a-Si:H(p), significantly improving the passivation properties after metallization (Fig. 3B). The improved passivation quality may be attributed to the a-Si:H(p) layer acting as a buffer layer, preventing the diffusion of metal atoms into the boron emitters and thereby reducing carrier recombination losses [34]. Additionally, a heterojunction formed by a-Si:H(p) and the boron emitter proves advantageous for energy bending, enhancing electric-field passivation, and mitigating carrier recombination [35]. To validate these hypotheses, TEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were conducted, where full-area Ni/Pd/Ag metal electrodes were deposited on the boron emitters. The results in Fig. 4A reveals that, for samples without a-Si:H(p), a distinct Ag signal within the boron emitter is observed, indicating the diffusion of Ag atoms into the boron emitter. In contrast, samples with a-Si:H(p) exhibit a relatively lower Ag signal within the boron emitters, suggesting suppressed Ag diffusion with the introduction of a-Si:H(p) between metal electrodes and boron emitters. For visual comparison, the atom fractions are plotted in Fig. 4C, S4 and S5, indicating Ag atom fractions within boron emitter region of 31.3% and 4.2% for the samples without and with a-Si: H(p), respectively. Furthermore, the results in Fig. 4C also demonstrate that the distribution of Ni and Pd for samples with a-Si:H(p) is more concentrated, indicating suppressed metal atom diffusion [36]. To further illustrate the impact of a-Si:H(p) on passivation performance, energy band diagrams for the cases with and without a-Si:H(p), calcu - lated based on the doping profiles obtained from ECV curves in Fig. 2A, are presented in Fig. 4D. It is evident from Fig. 4D that a heterojunction between a-Si:H(p) and the boron emitter is formed, attributed to enhance interface electric-field intensity and hinder minority carrier recombination, thereby improving passivation quality. 3.4.Performance of TOPCon SCs with a-Si:H(p) In the last section, we construct a proof-of-concept TOPCon SC with a boron-emitter R sheet  of ~150 /sq to illustrate the advantages of a-Si:H (p) as a local passivating contact for boron emitters, providing further validation for the feasibility of employing this method in the fabrication of boron emitters for TOPCon SCs. The schematic structure of the TOPCon SCs featuring a-SI:H(p) is depicted in Fig. 5A. As shown in Fig. 5B, the TOPCon structures, featuring Ni/Pd/Ag metal stack and a-Si: H(p) with B 2 H 6  of 8 sccm and FGA at 400 ◦ C for 30min, demonstrate an effective lifetime of 2.32ms at ∆n =10 15  cm –3  and a remarkable implied fill factor (iFF) of 85.43%, higher than that of the counterpart without a- Si:H(p), i.e., an effective lifetime of 1.43ms at ∆n =10 15  cm –3  and an iFF of 82.33%. The J-V curves of the TOPCon SCs without and with a-Si:H(p) are plotted in Fig. 5C, where the detailed electrical parameters of the two related cases are tabled insert. TOPCon SCs with a-Si:H(p) demonstrate an optimal efficiency of 24.50%, a V oc  of 696mV, a J sc  of 42.03mAcm –2 , and an FF of 83.76%. In contrast, TOPCon SCs without a-Si:H(p) receive an efficiency of 23.11%, a V oc  of 689mV, a J sc  of 41.80mAcm –2 , and an FF of 80.39%. The improvements in V oc  and FF suggest improved passivation and contact properties. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are demonstrated in Fig. 5D, which shows that TOPCon SCs with a-Si:H(p) exhibit a slightly increased EQE, especially in the short-wavelengths. It is noting that the V oc  values obtained from the J-V curves are lower than the voltages obtained after the front-sided metallization, owing to losses during both the front- and rear-sided metallization of busbars (Figure S6), which is an issue that  Fig. 3.(A) J 0  and (B) iV oc  of samples with and without a-Si:H(p) after metallization. (C) PL images of samples with and without a-Si:H(p) before and after metallization.  H. Yu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        needs to be addressed. 4.Conclusion In this work, we presented a low-temperature method for achieving selective boron emitters using PECVD deposition of a-Si:H(p) between boron emitters and metal electrodes, resulting in improved passivation and contact properties. Through the optimization of the fabrication process of a-Si:H(p) and annealing conditions, we successfully achieved a low contact resistivity of less than 1mcm 2  between the metal electrodes and the boron emitters, as well as a low J 0,met  of less than 400 fA/cm 2 . Additionally, excellent passivation and contact properties were maintained under various diborane flow rates for a-Si:H(p) fabrication, annealing temperatures, and sheet resistances of boron emitters, high - lighting the robustness of a-Si:H(p) in achieving high passivation and contact properties. Mechanisms contributing to the improved passiv - ation quality of boron emitters covered by a-Si:H(p) were elucidated through simulations and experiments. The presence of the a-Si:H(p) layer between boron emitters and metal electrodes serves as a buffer layer, preventing the diffusion of metal atoms and suppressing carrier recombination. A heterojunction formed by a-Si:H(p) and the boron emitter is favorable for promoting energy band bending, providing strengthened electric-field passivation. As a result, the TOPCon SCs with a boron-emitter R sheet  of ~150 /sq utilizing a-Si:H(p) after metalliza - tion received an average iV oc  of 718mV and a PCE of 24.50%, sur - passing the counterpart without a-Si:H(p) with an iV oc  of 707mV and a PCE of 23.11%. This work presents an advanced approach to prepare selective boron emitters based on a-Si:H(p), featuring a complete low-temperature process that is compatible with photoresist. This simplified process has the potential to be compatible with electroplating processes in the future. By carefully controlling the a-Si:H(p) layer, metal stacks, and annealing conditions, excellent contact properties with low contact re - sistivity and high passivation with low J 0,met  were achieved. Impor - tantly, this approach is fully compatible with boron emitters with high sheet resistance, providing a viable solution to enhance the efficiency of TOPCon SCs.

To dynamically control the residual H 2 O pressure, we installed a set of polycold coil and kept it turned on during the sputtering process. The film characteristics of Hall mobility, carrier density, sheet resistance, and transparency was investigated. The results revealed that the silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell with H 2  process had a higher Hall mobility and greater transparency in the 400–600 nm wavelength range resulting in a lower contact resistivity and a slight increase current density compared to the H 2 O process. The median efficiency (E ff ) achieved with the H 2  process improved by 0.09% absolute to 25.43%, mainly because of the increased J sc  and FF. And the IMO:H films with H 2  process had a large basal spacing with (400) and (222) crystal planes resulting in maintaining a more stable and reliable structure at temperatures below 200  ◦ C. After the optimization of TCO layer process, we manufactured the industrial-grade SHJ cells with max efficiency (E ff ), V oc , J sc , and fill factor (FF) values as high as 26.27%, 753 mV, 41 mA/cm 2 , and 86%, respectively. The IMO:H films with H 2  process can thus be considered more suitable for large-scale production.    1.Introduction In recent years, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) technology has gained increasing attention within the photovoltaic industry due to their high energy conversion efficiency and lean process flow. In 2022 year, LONGi company made headlines by announcing a series of certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) reaching up to 26.81% on industry-grade silicon wafers (274 cm 2 , M6 size). This achievement broke a five-year record for silicon solar cell efficiency [1], signifying the potential for SHJ solar cells to achieve PCE levels of up to 26% in mass production. SHJ solar cells are composed of a monocrystalline silicon wafer sand - wiched between nanometer-thick n-type (p-type) doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers. Due to the relatively poor conduc - tivity of a-Si:H layers, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers are essential on both the front and rear sides to facilitate lateral charge conduction towards the metal electrodes [2]. Among TCO thin films, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) films are the most commonly used because of their excellent optical and electrical properties [3]. In the fabrication process of SHJ solar cells, the ITO film is typically deposited using magnetron sputtering method. In efforts to enhance the efficiency of SHJ solar cells, Boccard et al. [4] conducted simulations to assess how the mobility and carrier density of TCO films impact the optical performance of SHJ solar cells, and highlighted the pivotal role of high mobility in TCO films for achieving high current density. The optimal structures of SHJ solar cell prefer ITO films with high carrier mobility and relatively low carrier concentration, as an excess of free charge carriers tends to enhance optical absorption [5]. Several reports suggest that the performance of ITO films can be significantly improved by introducing hydrogen or water vapor during the sputtering process. Koida et al. [6] demonstrated that the hydrogen-doped indium oxide (In 2 O 3 :H) films, deposited by sputtering an In 2 O 3  target in an atmosphere containing water vapor, exhibited an  *Corresponding author.

According to their study, H doping plays a crucial role in the exceptionally high mobility of In 2 O 3 :H films by eliminating O defi - ciency, generating H � singly charged donors, and reducing impurity scattering within the matrices of amorphous and crystalline In 2 O 3 :H films. Additionally, Li et al. [7] reported that the In 2 O 3 :H films, depos - ited by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering with H 2  gas doping, achieved high-mobility    ~100 cm 2 /Vs after the air-annealing treat - ment. During sputtering, H 2 O molecules readily decompose into H � and OH � [8], while H 2  molecules only decompose into H � . Both H � and OH � have the potential to form In–OH bonds at the surface of the growth, with an oxygen dangling bond and an In dangling bond, respectively. The In 2 O 3 :H films deposited via water vapor ambient and H 2  gas doping may possess different optical and electrical properties. However, based on the mass production of SHJ solar cells, few scholars have compared the performance differences of hydrogen-doped indium oxide thin films prepared by these two methods. In this work, an industrialized DC magnetron sputtering system was utilized to conduct separate experiments employing the water vapor (H 2 O) and hydrogen gas (H 2 ) processes to fabricate TCO films. We fine- tuned the H 2  ratio and H 2 O partial pressure to compare the mobility, carrier concentration, sheet resistance, and transparency of the resulting films. Following the optimization process for the TCO layer in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, we studied and further analyzed the per - formance of the solar cells created using the two different methods. 2.Experimental 2.1.IMO:H films deposition An industrialized sputtering system (model PVD16000 made by S.C) was used to deposit TCO films using DC magnetron sputtering method at room temperature. The growth mechanism of the film (nucleation, growth) is not discussed here [9]. The TCO target used in this work was In 2 O 3  ceramic target lightly doped with Ti, Ga and Zr (the exact doping ratio was confidential for business purposes) with a length of 2060 mm, an outer diameter of 153 mm, an inner diameter of 135 mm and a thickness of 9 mm. Next, the film prepared by this TCO target material in this study is collectively referred to as hydrogenated transition metal-doped indium oxide (IMO:H). The IMO:H films were deposited on glass sheets in 10 mm �10 mm �1 mm and 30 mm �30 mm �2 mm sizes for subsequent characterization of the electrical and optical prop - erties. The base pressure within the process chamber was maintained below 5 �10 �5  Pa, while the process pressure was set at 0.5 Pa. Argon (Ar) and oxygen (O 2 ) were used as the basic working gases. For H doping, the process chamber was filled with an ultrahigh purity hydrogen and argon mixture gas (H 2 /Ar) with a hydrogen weight per - centage of 2.8% and deionized water vapor separately. To regulate the residual water vapor pressure, a polycold coil was installed and kept operational during the sputtering process. The polycold coil is arranged in the process chamber, and the low temperature (�110~-150 o C) is generated by the generator of the polycold, which is transmitted to the coil. Additionally, a residual gas analyzer (RGA) was integrated into the chamber to monitor the partial pressure of water vapor and hydrogen. Throughout the deposition process, the deposition parameters of all the samples were: sputtering power, reaction pressure, Ar and O 2  flow rates were kept constant at 9.5 kW, 0.5Pa, 1000 sccm and 30 sccm, respec - tively. The H 2 /Ar gas flow was adjusted in the range of 0–700 sccm, and the water vapor flow was adjusted in the range of 0–30 sccm to facilitate the comparison of film properties. Finally, the IMO:H films deposited on glass samples were annealed at 200  � C for 30 min in an atmospheric environment for the measurement of electrical and optical properties. The deposited film is usually amorphous, with atoms showing irregular arrangement and many crystal defects. After annealing, the atoms will rearrange and crystallization will occur, which will repair some crystal defects in the film, which is conducive to improving the film performance. Therefore, the annealed film is selected for testing. 2.2.SHJ solar cells preparation SHJ solar cells were fabricated using n-type Czochralski (CZ) c-Si wafers with a size of 182 �91 mm 2  and thickness of 150   m. The fabrication process began with an ozone cleaning step. A heavy phos - phorus diffusion process (900 o C, 2 h) was then applied to getter the impurities from wafer bulk to the phosphorus silicate glass (PSG). Sub - sequently, the wafers underwent various wet-chemical procedures, including the removal of PSG and saw-induced damage, pyramid texturing, chemical pyramid rounding and RCA cleaning. Following the wet-chemical processes, intrinsic a-Si:H layers were deposited on both sides of wafers using a commercial plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system (13.56 MHz) at a temperature of 190  � C. Then, the n-doped and p-doped nanocrystalline layers were deposited on the front and rear surface of the silicon substrate via very high frequency (VHF) PECVD system, respectively. Subsequently, IMO:H films with the thicknesses of 100 nm and 120 nm were deposited on the front and rear sides of the SHJ solar cells. The primary focus of the experiments in this work was to examine the properties of the front IMO:H film, leaving the rear side TCO film unchanged. The final step involved completing the metal grid by screen printing silver paste, followed by drying, curing process (200  � C, 30 min), light soaking process and IV measurement. Fig. 1 depicts the schematic structure of the produced SHJ solar cells. 2.3.Characterization After deposition of the IMO:H films on glass, the samples were sub - jected to an annealing process in the Dryer box under atmospheric conditions to mimic the annealing conditions required for SHJ solar cells. Sheet resistance of the IMO:H film was determined using a ST-21 handheld four-point probe. The transmittance and reflectance spectra in the range of 300–1200 nm were measured using a spectrophotometer (Lambda 1050�). Electrical properties such as resistivity, carrier con - centration and mobility were analyzed through Hall effect measurement conducted using the Ecopia HMS-300 system. The crystal structure of the IMO:H films was investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE), with Cu K   (0.1541 nm) as the radiation source. The cross- sectional morphology of the film was observed by Transmission electron microscopy (Titan Themes Cubed G2 300, America). The cross-sectional specimens for TEM observation were prepared by FIB (TESCAN LYRA3 FIB-SEM). To assess the performance of solar cells, I–V tests were con - ducted under simulated AM 1.5 illumination with a light source of 1000 mW/cm 2  for 60 ms at a temperature of 25 �0.3  � C. The contact re - sistivity between IMO:H and silver finger were measured by the trans - mission length method (TLM). The contact resistivity from silicon bulk through a-Si:H(i/n) to TCO can be measured with Cox and Strack method. The quantum efficiency of light spectra ranging from 300 to 1200 nm was measured by a QE system (IVT-PVE300).  Fig. 1.Schematic structure of SHJ solar cell.   Y. Yuan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3.Results and discussion 3.1.Effect of H doping processes on the properties of the films In the H 2  process, we adjusted the H 2  ratio to prepare a variety of IMO:H films. H 2  ratio is defined by the following Eq. (1): H 2 ratio� 2:8%�ArH 2 flowArH 2 flow�O 2 flow�Arflow(1) Fig. 2 (a) illustrates the correlation between sheet resistance and Hall mobility, and carrier density as influenced by H 2  ratio. With an increase in the H 2  ratio, there is a notable decrease in sheet resistance from 76 /sq to below 40 /sq. Upon reaching an H 2  ratio of 0.8%, the sheet resistance stabilizes within the range of 35~40 /sq. Hall mobility initially rises from 66 cm 2 /V . s and reaches a peak value of 82 cm 2 /V . s at an H 2  ratio of 0.9%. However, as the H 2  ratio continues to increase, the sheet resistance rises sharply to above 70 /sq, the Hall mobility drops to below 60 cm 2 /V . s, the carrier density shows a similar trend to the Hall mobility, which is consistent with the effect of water pressure Hall mobility and carrier concentration [8]. The introduction of H signifi - cantly reduces the total defect scattering in the matrix, leading to improved mobility [10,11]. Beyond a critical H 2  ratio, mobility de - creases due to excessive interstitial hydrogen impurities causing carrier scattering, which remains stable under the annealing conditions. Considering the high carrier density may induce near-IR free carrier absorption (FCA), the 0.7% H 2  ratio was chosen as the H 2  process con - dition for fabricating the front IMO:H films of SHJ solar cells. Addi - tionally, the H 2 O partial pressure, monitored by RGA in the process chamber, showed an increasing trend alongside the rise in the H 2  ratio. By activating the polycold to dynamically regulate the H 2 O partial pressure, the H 2 O value increased to 5 �10 �3  Pa and remained stable. H 2 O molecules are formed by the reaction between H 2  and O 2  within the chamber and subsequently decompose into H � and OH � during the sputtering process. Fig. 2b shows the correlation between sheet resistance and Hall mobility, and carrier density at different H 2 O partial pressure levels. The H 2 O partial pressure was manipulated by altering the inlet water vapor flow. Unlike the H 2  process, the sheet resistance undergoes a slight decrease with increasing H 2 O partial pressure, and then kept stable at ~40 /sq. In contrast, the Hall mobility displays a relatively flat curve within the range of 65–67 cm 2 /V . s as the H 2 O partial pressure increases from 1 �10 �3  Pa to 5 �10 �3  Pa. When the H 2 O partial pressure comes up to 5.5 �10 �3  Pa, the Hall mobility trends to increase. The peak mobility of 74.5 cm 2 /V . s is observed at an H 2 O partial pressure of 6.8 �10 �3  Pa, and the mobility will decrease with the continuous increase of H 2 O partial pressure. This result is in agreement with the report of Wang et al. [12]. The carrier density follows a similar trend to the Hall mobility. The chosen condition for the fabrication of the front IMO:H films for SHJ solar cells was set at 5 �10 �3  Pa for the H 2 O process. The electrical properties curve, based on the two H doping methods, clearly indicates significant differences between hydrogen gas doping and water vapor ambient processes. Consequently, the IMO:H samples with the two best conditions were selected, and the corresponding crystal structures were analyzed using XRD. Fig. 3 presents the XRD spectra of two distinct IMO:H films deposited under different conditions: at a 0.7% H 2  ratio (H 2  process) and at 5 �10 �3  Pa H 2 O partial pressure (H 2 O process). After annealing at 200  � C, the diffraction peaks observed at 21.5 � , 30.6 � , 35.5 � , 51 � , 60.8 � can be corresponded to (211), (222), (400), (440) and (622) of In 2 O 3  phase prepared by H 2  process. In contrast, the diffraction peaks observed at 21.5 � , 30.6 � , 41.8 � , 63.7 � for In 2 O 3  films prepared by H 2 O process can correspond to the crystal orientation of (211), (222), (332), (444) for  Fig. 2.Sheet resistance (R sheet ), Hall mobility (  ) and Free carrier density (Ne) of the IMO:H films post annealing with the variation of H 2  ratio and H 2 O par - tial pressure.

Yuan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In 2 O 3  films. The intensity of (222) diffraction peak, typically occurring around 30 ◦ , serves as an indicator of crystallization of the IMO:H films. It’s notable that the intensity of the sample from the H 2 O process is considerably stronger than that of the H 2  process sample, which in - dicates that the crystallinity of IMO:H films prepared by H 2 O process is significantly higher than that by H 2  process. We obtained the FWHM of the (222) crystal surface through Gaussian simulation. The crystallite size is evaluated using the Scherrer formula as in Eq. (2) [13], D= Kcos(2) where D represents the crystallite size, K is a constant and usually takes the value 1,   is the wavelength of the X-ray,  is the FWHM, and  is the diffraction angle. The crystallite size of the films deposited from the H 2 O and H 2  processes are 63.7 nm and 65.2 nm, respectively. So that the crystallite size of the film prepared by the two processes are roughly the same order. The degree of crystallization relies on both crystal size and crystal density. In the H 2 O process, H 2 O molecules are almost entirely decom - posed into H + and OH � before being incorporated into the IMO:H films. The H 2  and O 2  will also react to form H 2 O in the H 2  process, and H 2 O will further ionize to generate H + and OH � , and the above complex physical and chemical reactions will occur in the process. As previously reported, terminating oxygen-dangling bonds with OH prevents con - struction of In–O–In bond networks, thereby suppresses the crystal growth [6,14]. Ando et al. [15] indicated that the crystal size of In 2 O 3  becomes smaller as the H 2 O partial pressure increases, although the density of crystallites sharply changes at high H 2 O partial pressure. However, for the IMO:H film prepared by the two methods, RGA showed the H 2 O partial pressure at the same level, so the crystallite size of the two samples was little different. In addition, it was observed that the H partial pressure in the H 2  process (1 ×10 �2  Pa) is higher than that in the H 2 O process (7 ×10 �3  Pa), suggesting that the H + ion density in the H 2  process was notably greater. In IMO:H films, the incorporation of H can generate singly charged impurities; both substitutional hydrogen and interstitial hydrogen bonded with oxygen act as shallow donors [16]. It’s presumed that the H composition in the IMO:H films deposited via the H 2  process is higher than in the H 2 O process, potentially resulting in the difference in Hall mobility between the two processes. To further investigate the differences in the microstructure of the films prepared by the two processes, the microstructure evolution of IMO:H films was investigated by TEM. The cross-sectional TEM micro - graph of IMO:H films prepared by H 2  and H 2 O process is shown in Fig. 4. The cross-sectional TEM micrograph of IMO:H film prepared by H 2  process (Fig. 4a) shows a uniform and columnar-free structure with a film thickness of 96.3 nm. Combining with the lattice spacing (0.253 nm, 0.297 nm) measured from HRTEM image (Fig. 4b) and only (400) and (222) crystal planes of In 2 O 3  phase has a close lattice distance of 0.253 nm and 0.297 nm (JCPDS 060416), respectively. It can be reasonably inferred that this region corresponds to (400) and (222) crystal planes of In 2 O 3  phase, and this result is consistent with XRD results. Similar to the H 2  process, the IMO:H film prepared by the H 2 O process has a uniform and columnar crystal structure with a film thickness of 94.5 nm (Fig. 4c). In contrast, the (332) and (222) crystal surfaces of In 2 O 3  were found in the H 2 O process (Fig. 4d), which can also be consistent with the XRD results. In addition, the interface between the crystal Si and IMO:H films can be clearly observed in Fig. 4b and d. The clear interface between (222) and (400) crystal plane of IMO:H films prepared by H 2  process can be observed in Fig. 4b, and the interface between (222) and (332) crystal plane of IMO:H films prepared by H 2 O process can be observed in Fig. 4d. We also analyzed the optical properties of the two IMO:H films. Fig. 5 shows the effective transmittance (TTe) and absorptance spectra. TTe is defined in the following Eq. (3) [17]: TTe= T1�R(3)  where T is the absolute transmittance of the film plus glass, and R is the absolute reflectance. Indeed, it’s evident that the transmittance of IMO: H films generated through the H 2  process is greater than those produced via the H 2 O process within the wavelength range of 400–600 nm. This is related to the weaker short-wavelength absorption of In 2 O 3 : H films prepared by H 2  process. A. Valla et al. [18] reported that when Ne be - tween 2 ×10 19  and 3 ×10 20  cm �3 , mobility was limited by scattering at ionized impurities. As ionized impurities concentration decreased and hence the associated scattering, thus allowed an increase of the mobility. Lower ionized impurities concentration would cause higher mobility, thus leading to weaker short-wavelength absorption. Therefore, this disparity in transmittance contributes to the observed high Hall mobility. Overall, in this work, the IMO:H films manufactured through the H 2  process displayed superior electrical and optical properties compared to those produced via the H 2 O process, utilizing an industri - alized PVD system. 3.2.Effect of the H doping processes on the performance of SHJ solar cells In Fig. 6, various characteristics of the SHJ solar cells are presented. In Fig. 6 (a), the I–V results demonstrate that the median value of the efficiency (E ff ) of SHJ solar cells by H 2  process reaches 25.43%, while the E ff  of SHJ solar cells by H 2 O process is slightly lower by 0.09% abs . Notably, the median open-circuit voltage (V oc ) remains relatively consistent between the two processes. The specific parameters of the films prepared by the two processes on the solar cell are shown in Table 1. However, the short-circuit current density (J sc ) and fill factor (FF) follow the same trend as the efficiency. The J sc  of SHJ solar cells by the H 2  process has around 39.96 mA/cm 2 , exhibiting a marginal 0.05 mA/cm 2  increase over the H 2 O process. In Fig. 6 (b), the EQE and reflectance spectra are compared. The SHJ solar cells by H 2  process displays a slight EQE increase in the wavelength of 400–500 nm, which is consistent with the TTe spectra. The median value of FF of SHJ solar cells by H 2  process is approximately 85.19%, indicating a minor increase of 0.18 % abs  compared to the H 2 O process. The difference in FF is linked to the series resistance (Rs) difference (see Fig. 6 (c)). E-C Wang et al. [19] demonstrated a simple method with analytical model to extract heterojunction solar cell series resistance components. And Rs compo - nents related with TCO are sheet resistance of TCO, contact resistivity  Fig. 3.XRD patterns of IMO:H films prepared by H 2  process and H 2 O process annealed at temperatures of 200  ◦ C.  Y. Yuan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     between TCO and Ag, and contact resistivity from silicon bulk through a-Si:H(i/n) to TCO. Herein, the difference in Rs between the two pro - cesses primarily arises from the contact resistance Rc at the Ag/IMO:H interface and the IMO:H/Si interface, as the Rsheet of IMO:H between the two processes was almost the same, and other components of the cells remained unchanged. The contact resistivity   c  of these interfaces was measured using the TLM method and the Cox-Strack approach, respectively. Fig. 7a presents the current-voltage curves for the maximum and minimum measured   c IMO: H/Si values from the data in Fig. 7b, with the median   c _IMO:H/Si difference between the two pro - cesses being approximately 1 m cm 2 . The difference in contact re - sistivity at the Ag/IMO:H interface is 0.8 m cm 2 . When translated to contact resistance values, Rc_IMO:H/Si and Rc_Ag/IMO:H equal 0.006 m and 0.2 m, respectively. Based on this result, it can be concluded that the Rs difference between the two processes is dominated by the contact resistance at the Ag/IMO:H interface. Barraud et al. [20] re - ported that the contact resistance at the interface between the IO:H layer and the silver grid increased significantly after 200  � C annealing. Hydrogen- and oxygen-containing species effused from IO:H films sputtered in a water-containing atmosphere and reacted with silver after annealing. The lower Ag/IMO:H contact resistivity indicates that the IMO:H film generated via the H 2  process exhibits a more stable struc - ture, proving reliable at the temperature below 200  � C. Based on the small spot EQE data, the current loss of the cells pre - pared by the two processes was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 8, compared with the IMO:H film prepared by water process, the IMO:H film pre - pared by H 2  process has better blue light response and less parasitic absorption in the near infrared band, which is also the reason for the higher current density of the IMO:H film prepared by H 2  process. Fig. 9 exhibits the IV characteristics plot of the highest conversion efficiency solar cell, achieving a maximum efficiency of 25.88%, as measured by ISFH (Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin). During mass production, we monitored the H 2 O partial pressure using RGA and discovered that the H 2 O partial pressure within the H 2  process remained notably more stable compared to the H 2 O process. In the H 2 O process, when the chamber was filled with water vapor, the H 2 O  Fig. 4.Cross-sectional TEM and HRTEM micrographs of the IMO:H films with H 2  process (a, b) and H 2 O process (c, d).   Fig. 5.TTe spectra of the IMO:H films post annealing as a function of H 2  and H 2 O process.  Y. Yuan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     pressure consistently increased from 5 ×10 �3  Pa to over 8 ×10 �3  Pa during continuous production runs, even with the polycold system activated. To address this challenge, it’s necessary to frequently adjust the water vapor flow in response to the fluctuating H 2 O partial pressure. The excessive H 2 O uptake as a key factor in the high contact resistance of Ag/IMO:H with H 2 O, because some H 2 O degassed from around the substrate carrier, chamber wall and targets shield by continuous pro - duction running, even though the RGA monitoring is the same. In contrast, the H 2  process exhibited more stability and reliability without encountering such issues, making it more suitable for mass production purposes. 4.Conclusion In summary, we conducted a comparative study between two methods, H 2  process and H 2 O process, utilizing an industrialized DC magnetron sputtering system for hydrogen doping of indium oxide. After annealing, we compared the electrical and optical properties of IMO:H films produced by these distinct processes. The H 2  process exhibited superior electrical and optical properties, boasting higher Hall mobility and reduced light absorption in shorter wavelengths compared to the H 2 O process. When applied as the front IMO:H layer for SHJ solar cells, the H 2  process showed higher efficiency compared to the H 2 O process, mainly attributed to higher J sc  and FF. The TLM measurements indicated that the lower contact resistivity between the IMO:H layer and the silver finger contributed to the higher FF. This demonstrates the superior stability and reliability of the IMO:H film produced by the H 2  process at the temperatures below 200  ◦ C. In conclusion, considering these findings, the H 2  process emerges as the optimal choice for hydrogen doping indium oxide in the mass production of SHJ solar cells.

In this work, we study the eﬀects of single-layer and multi-layer p-type emitters, including boron-doped hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) and/or boron-doped hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOX:H) ﬁlms, on the device perfor-mance of SHJ solar cells. The results demonstrate that the sandwich-like p-type emitters of p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H have the potential to become an eﬀective and eﬃcient candidate to result in higher eﬃciency. The lightly boron-doped p-nc-Si:H is used to reduce the incubation layer thickness in the initial stage of growth, while the low parasitic absorption of the p-nc-SiOX:H emitter leads to an increase in short-circuit current. Moreover, a highly boron-doped  p+-nc-Si:H layer is implemented on top of the p-nc-SiOX:H to get a lower series resistance (Rs) and higher ﬁll factor. Lastly, we achieve a champion SHJ solar cell on planar wafer with an open-circuit voltage of 678.2mV, a short-circuit current density of 36.6mA/cm2, a ﬁll factor of 77% and a conversion eﬃciency of 19.11%.Graphic abstract Keywords Silicon heterojunction· Solar cells· Planar wafer· p-type emitters· Triple layers1 IntroductionThe silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell is considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next-generation high-eﬃciency crystalline silicon (c-Si) device [1]. Although the interdigitated back contact silicon heterojunction   * Guofu Hou  gfhou@nankai.edu.cnExtended author information available on the last page of the article  J.Zhou et al. 735 Page 2 of 6(IBC-SHJ) architecture resulted in the world-record e-ciency of 26.63%, the both side-contacted SHJ architecture is still the popular candidate because of its relatively sim-ple processes [2, 3]. However, the champion eciency of 25.11% for the both side-contacted SHJ solar cell is lower than that of 25.8% for the homojunction c-Si solar cell with the so-called tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) structure, which is mainly attributed to the relatively lower short-circuit current density (JSC) [49]. Usually, it is easy to get JSC values around 42mA/cm2 for the both side-contacted homojunction c-Si solar cells, while the typical JSC values for the both side-contacted SHJ solar cells are in the range from 39 to 40mA/cm2, which are notably caused by the parasitic absorption of window layers [1013]. Therefore, in addition to applying as thin as possible a window layer, an alternative approach is to alloy hydrogenated silicon lms with oxygen or carbon to get wider bandgap and lower para-sitic absorption [1417]. Another necessary characteristic for the window layers is high conductivity to get a lower series resistance between the emitter/ITO contact, which is benet for the ll factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) [15, 1821]. Thus, hydrogenated silicon alloys with nanometer crystals embedded in amorphous silicon matrix were proposed, in which nanocrystals not only result in high conductivity but also help to increase the bandgap because of quantum connement eect [14, 2224]. Due to its tun-able refractive index, a low absorption coecient and a suf-cient electrical conductivity, recently considerable works have proved the eectiveness of hydrogenated nanocrystal-line silicon oxide (nc-SiOX:H) lms as the window/emitter layers in the both side-contacted SHJ solar cells [2527]. For example, the record eciency of 25.11% has been obtained using hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide as the front surface eld to get high enough JSC value [4].For the SHJ solar cell, an intrinsic a-Si:H layer is the crucial and indispensable part to get better c-Si surface pas-sivation and then higher eciency [17, 28, 29]. However, it is a very challenging issue to nucleate and then form highly crystalline layers on an a-Si:H passivation layer, which will be even more dicult since the window layer is only 15nm or less in the SHJ solar cell [30]. In addition, although the introduction of oxygen or carbon increases light transmis-sion, it is inevitable to further reduce the crystallinity of hydrogenated nanocrystaline silicon alloy lms. Various interface treatment methods have been developed to real-ize fast nucleation on the a-Si:H layers while maintaining excellent passivation quality [31]. The rst and the most popular method is hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) on the (i)a-Si:H/c-Si interface, which can result in high chemi-cal interface-passivation quality and help to the nucleation and crystallinity of following hydrogenated nanocrystaline silicon alloys layer [32, 33]. An alternate  CO2 plasma treat-ment was also proved to get similar results [3437]. Another ecient method is to deposit an ultra-thin, highly crystalline seed layer to inhibit the amorphous incubation layer and form a nucleation layer to improve the crystallinity [38, 39].From above analysis, we can nd that for the emitters of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, which simul-taneously act as the window layers, high conductivity and wide bandgap are essential parameters to achieve eec-tive carrier transportation and collection and then the total device performance. In this study, various p-type emitters including single-, double- and sandwich-like triple layers were designed by combination of boron-doped nanocrys-taline silicon (p-nc-Si:H) and boron-doped nanocrystaline silicon oxide (p-nc-SiOX:H) layers [40]. The aim is to take advantage of both the high crystallinity, better charge car-rier transport and low contact resistance of p-nc-Si:H and a much reduced parasitic absorption of p-nc-SiOX:H. The experimental results indicate that a sandwich-like emitter with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H triple layers has the potential to become an ecient and eective way to improve the SHJ device performance.2  Experimental methodsDouble-sided polished FZ n-type c-Si wafers with < 111 > orientation, thickness of 275 ± 10m and electrical resistivity of 210 cm were adopted in this study. All the wafers were successively cleaned by acetone, deionized water, ultrasonic cleaning, RCA1 and RCA2 pro-cedures. Then, these wafers were immediately loaded into the Cluster tool plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system to deposit the i-a-Si:H passivation layers, p-type emitter layers and n-type layers. All p-nc-Si:H, p-nc-SiOX:H, and p + -nc-Si:H layers were deposited at 200℃ substrate temperature with  SiH4,  CO2,  H2 as process gases and  PH3 or B(CH3)3 as doping gases. The device congura-tion of the planar SHJ solar cells in this study was Ag grid/ITO/p-type emitter/i-a-Si:H/N-FZ-Si/i-a-Si:H/n-type layer/Al back contact. The ITO layer, Ag grid and Al back contact were deposited by the thermal evaporation.A Cary 5000 spectrometer was used to measure the transmission and reection spectra, and the bandgaps of the Si thin lm materials were calculated using Tauc for-mula in conjunction with the test results. A programmable Keithley617 electrometer with high precision was used to test the conductivity. Raman scattering was measured on glass substrates by a Renishaw RM2000 microscope with a 488nm laser. The current density versus voltage (JV) curves were measured by an AM1.5 solar simulator (WXS-156S-L2, AM1.5GMM) with 100 mW/cm2 at 25℃. The external quantum eciency (EQE) spectra were measured by using a QEX10 PV system, and the JSC was calculated by the integral of measured EQE and the AM1.5 solar spectra.  Page 3 of 6 735To measure the passivation quality, Sinton Instruments WCT-120 QSSPC tester was used in transient or quasi-steady state analysis mode of generalized (1/1) or (64/1) at an injection level of 1 ×  1015/cm3.3  Results anddiscussion3.1  Structural andoptoelectronic properties ofp-type layersThe rst step is to study the optoelectronic properties of p-type layers. Five samples named as 1#, 2#, 3#, 4# and 5# represent  p+-nc-Si:H, p-nc-Si:H, p-nc-SiOX:H, p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H and p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H, respectively. All the samples were deposited with the same temperature of 300℃, chamber pressure of 1.98Torr and RF power of 10W. Other deposition parameters are listed in Table1. Figure1 shows the Raman spectra of these ve p-type layers. It can be found that for the 1#, 2# and 3# sam-ples, broad amorphous peaks at 480  cm1 were dominated, while only slight signals from 515 to 520  cm1 occur, which indicates that these layers are in the mixed state of amor-phous and nanocrystalline grains. From the Raman spectra of 1# and 2# samples, it can be seen that a heavily dopant can cause a slightly reduced crystallinity. The introduc-tion of  CO2 also reduces the crystallinity from the Raman spectra of 1#, 2# and 3# samples. In order to increase the crystallinity, a double-layered sample (4#) is designed with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H, of which a slightly doped p-nc-Si:H serve as the seed layer. Since the bandgap of p-nc-Si:H is much lower than that of p-nc-SiOX:H as shown in Table1, the seed layer should be as thin as possible to guarantee the light transparence. The Raman spectra show that even only 2nm seed layer is applied, there still exists a remarkable peak at 520  cm1, which indicates the much more improved crystallinity compared to the single-layered samples 1#, 2# and 3#. The triple-layered sample (5#) with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H also demonstrated similar results.The optical transmittance (T), reectance (R) spectra of those ve p-type layers were measured and the absorbance (1-T-R) result is calculated, as shown in Figure2. It can be found that the single-layered 1# and 2# samples demon-strate the lowest transmittances. Even though the 3# sample was composed of p-nc-SiOx:H layer, its transmittance is still lower than those for the double-layered (4#) and triple-layered (5#) samples. The reasons can be partly contributed to the enhanced crystallinity of 4# and 5# samples, which leads to increased oxygen content and dierent SiO bonds. In fact, the calculated bandgap (Eg) values for these ve samples in Table1 also prove above explanations. The Eg value of 3# sample is 2.03eV, which is much higher than those for 1# and 2# samples but much lower than those for 4# and 5# samples.Table 1  The deposition parameters and optoelectronic properties of p-type layers Sample Nop-type layersH2 (sccm)SiH4 (sccm)TMB (sccm)CO2 (sccm)Thick-ness (nm)Conductivity (S/cm)Bandgap (eV)1#p+-nc-Si:H40022156.25E31.792#p-nc-Si:H18012.4158.94E51.723#p-nc-SiOX:H4000.7520.5187.81E92.074#p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-18012.421.01E62.28SiOX:H4000.7520.5165#p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-18012.427.40E52.29SiOX:H/p+-nc-4000.7520.514Si:H400222 Fig. 1  Raman spectra of dierent p-type layers on glass substrates. 1#  p+-nc-Si:H, 2# p-nc-Si:H, 3# p-nc-SiOX:H, 4# p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H, 5# p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H  J.Zhou et al. 735 Page 4 of 6Conductivities of these ve p-type layers are also listed in Table1. Compared with 1# and 2# sample, a heavily TMB dopant signicantly increases the conductivity from 8.94 ×  105 to 6.25 ×  103 S/cm. The introduction of  CO2 into the lm (3# sample) leads to a dramatic reduction of the conductivity to an as low value as 7.81 ×  109 S/cm. When the p-nc-Si:H layers were used as seed layers prior to p-nc-SiOx:H layers, the conductivity of 4# sample increases to 1.01 ×  106 S/cm. If the p + -nc-Si:H layer was used to cover 4# sample, the conductivity of the sandwich-like p-type layer (5# sample) further increases to 7.40 ×  105 S/cm, which is very close to that of 2# sample. From above design and optimization, we can conclude that high crystallinity, high conductivity and wide bandgap can be simultaneously obtained by the sandwich-like p-type layer (5# sample).3.2  SHJ solar cells withdierent p-type emitter/window layersIn this section, three p-type layers were adopted as the emit-ter/window layers in SHJ solar cells. The rst type is p-nc-SiOx:H single layer with the same deposition parameters as that of 3# in Table1, as shown in Figure3a. The second one consists of a lightly doped p-nc-Si:H layer with low defect density and a low absorption p-nc-SiOx:H layer with the same deposition parameters as that of 4# in Table1, as shown in Figure3a. Figure3c shows the last one named as the sandwich-like emitter with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOx:H/p+-nc-Si:H triple layers with the same deposition parameters as that of 5# in Table1, of which the lightly doped p-nc-Si:H layer with 2nm act as a seed layer to get a fast nucleation and increase the total crystallinity of the p-emitter/window layer. The low absorption p-nc-SiOX:H layer with 14nm leads to a reduced parasitic absorption and improve the JSC of the solar cell. The highly doped  p+-nc-Si:H layer with 2nm is implemented on top of the sandwich-like emitter to achieve a lower series resistance and improve the p-emitter/TCO contact.The illuminated JV curves of these SHJ solar cells are shown in Figure4, while the corresponding external Fig. 2  Transmittance and absorbance of dierent p-type layers Fig. 3  Schematic diagrams of a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction solar cells with dierent p-type emitter/window layers. a p-nc-SiOx:H single layer, b p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOx:H double layers and c sandwich-like emitter with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOx:H/p+-nc-Si:H triple layer Page 5 of 6 735quantum eciencies are present in Figure5. Noted that the champion conversion eciency of SHJ solar cell using a single layer p-nc-Si:H emitter was only 16.7% in our previ-ous study [41]. Figure4 shows that the VOC and JSC of (a) sample are signicantly higher than those of (b) sample. The reason for the VOC improvement can be contributed to the higher conductivity (as shown in Table1) by the double-layer p-type emitter/window layer, which benets to enhance the built-in electric eld, reduce the interface carrier recombination and improve the eld-eect passiva-tion quality of the solar cell. On the other hand, the high transmittance, wide bandgap and gradient refractive index of the p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H p-type emitter/window layer help to increase the JSC. When the sandwich-like emit-ter with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H triple layers is adopted, even higher FF and JSC are obtained for the (c) sample, which can be explained by the reduced emit-ter/ITO contact resistance and improved carrier collec-tion because of the improved conductivity of  p+-nc-Si:H layer. A champion eciency of 19.11% has been achieved with VOC of 678.2mV, FF of 77% and JSC of 36.6mA/cm2 for the planar SHJ cell with an area of 1.0  cm2. This high-eciency planar SHJ solar cell can be a very promis-ing candidate as the bottom cell in the perovskite/silicon monolithic tandem solar cell, in which the perovskite top cell is fabricated by a solution procedure [42].From Figure5, we can see that these three solar cells demonstrate quite different EQE curves. The solar cell with p-nc-SiOX:H single layer behaves higher EQE values in the range from 300 to 470nm and 820nm to 1050nm, but a much lower EQE values in the range from 470 to and 820nm. On the contrany, the solar cells with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H double-layer and sandwich-like emitter with p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H triple layer behave very similar EQE curves. Compared to the solar cell with p-nc-SiOX:H single layer behaves, they have lower EQE values in the range from 300 to 470nm and 820nm to 1050nm, but a much higher EQE values in the range from 470 to and 820nm. These phenomena can be partly ascribed to dier-ent refractive indexes of these three p-type emitter/window layers. A further optimization of the refractive index gradi-ent of all light-incoming side including ITO, p-type emitter/window layer and even a magnesium uoride  (MgF2) layer with very low refractive index as the anti-reective coating will be the focus of the next step to improve the spectral response and then the device eciency. Another necessary emphasis should be to optimize the interface and passivation layer quality to improve the open-circuit voltage, which is still much lower than the state-of-the-art VOC values of SHJ solar cells [13].4  ConclusionsVarious p-type layers by combining p-nc-Si:H, p-nc-SiOx:H and  p+-nc-Si:H layers were proposed and investigated as the emitter/window layer in the planner SHJ solar cell. By studying the structural and optoelectronic properties of various p-type layers and their inuence on the SHJ device performance, the novel sandwich-like p-type layer consist-ing of p-nc-Si:H/p-nc-SiOX:H/p+-nc-Si:H triple layers is proved to be the optimal emitter/window layer, which can be contributed to its high crystallinity, high conductivity and wide bandgap. With this novel sandwich-like p-type emit-ter/window layer, we obtained a VOC of 678.2mV, a JSC of 36.6mA/cm2, a ll factor of 77% and an eciency of 19.11% on a planar n-type FZ Si-wafer.

The 3D-FIB method has been used to investigate the transition metal precipitate distribution around extended crystal defects, showing a strong influence of crystallographic parameters on the precipitation behavior. In addition, the transition metal precipitate distribution after a phosphorous (POCl 3 ) diffusion process and a corresponding temperature profile alone has been investigated. During POCl 3  diffusion the transition metal precipitates dissolve and the transition metals move to regions with higher solubility leaving voids behind, which can still act as recombination active centers and have to be taken into account in further process treatments. The diffusivity and density of silicon self interstitials and the duration of the POCl 3  diffusion is not sufficient to fill the voids. If only the temperature profile of a POCl 3  diffusion is applied, the transition metal precipitates dissolve but return to the same sites during cool down due to a missing external getter sink.    © 2015 The Authors.

To investigate transition metal precipitates in silicon, synchrotron based measurements like micro x-ray fluorescence (μXRF) [1, 2], or detailed TEM studies, e.g. [3], are usually necessary. It has been demonstrated that so-called 3D-FIB is also able to detect precipitates down to 5 nm in radius and provides additional information about the 3D shape, size and spatial distribution of the precipitates [4]. This 3D-FIB method has been applied to several samples before and after solar cell process treatments to investigate the influence of the respective processing step on the transition metal distribution. 2.   Experiment The investigated samples were intentionally contaminated by 20 ppma Cu in the melt during crystal growth to enhance the transition metal concentration in the Si material. Neutron activation analysis results in an overall concentration of approximately 1*1018 at/cm 3  Cu for the investigated samples. Falkenberg et al. [5] have demonstrated that electron beam induced current (EBIC) pre-characterization provides the possibility to prepare TEM lamellas exactly at the position of highly recombination active regions and therefore enhances the successful  measurements of transition metal precipitates. The same approach can be used for 3D-FIB. A FIB cross-section has to be cut at the area of interest. Afterwards, single FIB cuts with a distance in the range of a few nm or tens of nm are performed. SEM images have been recorded automatically after each FIB cut and are further analyzed to extract  only the transition metal precipitates within the investigated sample area. This analysis results in a 3D picture of the distribution of particles within the investigated area, which allows extracting additional information like the size and shape of the precipitates. Additional energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) measurements at larger particles in the μm-range allow to draw conclusions about the composition of these particles (exemplarily shown in [4]). Beside detailed investigations of as-grown material, differently processed samples were also analyzed. The investigated process steps include a standard POCl 3  diffusion as well as a temperature treatment comparable to that of the POCl 3  diffusion but without P source.   3.   Results The detection limit of transition metal precipitates is influenced by the applied measurement parameters like SEM magnification and resolution, as well as the distance between two FIB cuts. For parameters used in this investigation, precipitates with r=8 nm can be detected, comparable or even better than for several μXRF facilities. Detection of even smaller precipitates has already been demonstrated by optimizing measurement parameters. 3.1.   As-grown samples As an example of local differences in the transition metal distribution at extended crystal defects, two different areas of interest on the same sample are shown: (1) a region around a Si 3N4  inclusion, and (2) a highly recombination active defect in the centre of a grain. Both areas have been investigated in a control experiment by μXRF showing a high Cu concentration. In case of region (1) a remarkably high density of particles is detected. Up to 40 precipitates per μm² with an average radius of approximately 18 nm were found. For comparison, the corresponding μXRF measurements have shown only a diffuse Cu signal around the Si 3N4  needle and not single precipitates [4].    240   Annika Zuschlag et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  238 – 241    Fig. 1. (a) SEM image indicates different shapes of transition metal precipitates; (b) 3D reconstruction of the investigated sample area, view in the direction of FIB cuts. The Cu precipitates are perfectly aligned; (c) 3D reconstruction of (b) rotated by 90° to demonstrate the distribution of the Cu precipitates, their different sizes and shape. The investigation of area (2) results in the detection of several larger precipitates assorted in a certain plane. Fig. 1 shows the 3D-FIB reconstruction of the precipitates from two different angles. Two different shapes are observed especially for larger precipitates: a disc-like shape and a more or less spherical or angular shape. The disc- like precipitates are located within the plane, while all precipitates with an angular shape stand out of the plane and just touch them from one side as can be seen in Fig. 1b. This leads to the assumption that local structural conditions of the Si matrix as well as stress fields strongly influence the formation of precipitates. 3.2.   Influence of processing steps After POCl 3  diffusion hardly any Cu precipitates are detected anymore. Instead several voids (up to 1 μm in diameter) are visible in the SEM images in Fig. 2. Additional EDX measurements show no Cu contamination at the  voids or the surrounding area within the detection limits. Due to the high diffusivity of  Cu  in the temperature range of POCl 3  diffusions, the Cu precipitates dissolve and Cu atoms diffuse to the n-doped emitter region and the phosphorous silicate glass at the sample surface. Both regions show a higher solubility of transition metals compared to the p-doped Si base material and act therefore as a getter sink for transition metals. Diffusivity and density of Si self interstitials and the duration of the POCl 3  diffusion is not sufficient to fill the voids with Si. It has to be mentioned that these voids are still extended crystal defects which can act as recombination active defects as well as nucleation sites for other impurities and therefore affect the solar cell, even if the Cu concentration in the sample is decreased.      Fig. 2. Three single SEM images out of a 3D-FIB cross cut series: after P-gettering voids (indicated by red arrows) are detected and almost no Cu precipitates are found anymore.   Annika Zuschlag et al.  /  Energy Procedia   77  ( 2015 )  238 – 241 241 If only the temperature profile of a phosphorous diffusion is applied to a sample, the 3D-FIB results are comparable to those of the as-grown sample. During the high temperature treatment Cu precipitates are dissolved and voids are left behind. Due to the lack of an external getter sink these voids act as nucleation sites for Cu  precipitates during cool down resulting in a re-precipitation of Cu at the same sample area. This clearly demonstrates how careful temperature treatments during solar cell process steps have to be designed to avoid a re-precipitation of impurities at these voids. 4.   Conclusions 3D-FIB closes the gap of missing 3D information of precipitate distribution, size, and shape compared to XRF and TEM studies. The advantages of 3D-FIB have been demonstrated in case of different areas of an as-grown sample which have shown similar μXRF results but a completely different distribution of Cu precipitates using 3D-FIB. The dissolution of Cu precipitates during POCl 3  diffusion and the beneficial gettering behaviour is well known. 3D-FIB allows a more detailed investigation of the defect structure of POCl 3  diffused samples resulting in the observation of voids after gettering which has to be taken into account in following process steps.
