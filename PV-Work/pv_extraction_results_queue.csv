Fa-Jun Ma,Ma,2024,N/A,"Silicon solar cells, Space applications, 1 MeV electron irradiation, Numerical simulation, PERC, TOPCon","When utilizing substrates with high doping levels, both PERC and TOPCon cells exhibit nearly identical beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-life (EOL) performance. However, with lower substrate doping concentrations, both technologies show improved BOL efficiency. Notably, this enhanced BOL efficiency does not translate into superior EOL efficiency. This distinction in EOL efficiency can be attributed to two primary factors triggered by radiation exposure. Firstly, the emergence of defects leads to a reduction in open-circuit voltage. Secondly, dopant compensation contributes to an increase in series resistance.","PERC, TOPCon",Silicon,Silicon,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
